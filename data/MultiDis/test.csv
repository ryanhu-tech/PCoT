Terrestrial animals will not provide the bears with the nutrients they need.
What is a day in the life of a polar bear like? Researchers recently found out after strapping collar cameras to several bears.
Scientists have long hypothesized what would happen to polar bear populations in the Arctic as sea ice continues to melt at unprecedented rates. But now they have visual evidence of just how hard it will be for polar bears to find sustenance as the sea ice disappears.
Polar bears rely on sea ice to hunt their preferred prey -- seals that are stock full of fat and blubber that provide polar bears the energy they need to survive the elements of the Arctic.
As the sea ice experiences mass melting, the polar bears have no other choice but to gravitate toward land. And researchers are now witnessing how the species is adapting to land-dwelling after fastening cameras equipped with GPS trackers and cameras onto 20 bears living in the western Hudson Bay in Manitoba, Canada, Anthony Pagano, research wildlife biologist at the U.S. Geological Survey's Alaska Science Center, told ABC News. The bears were studied during a three-week ice-free period from 2019 to 2022, Pagano said.
The researchers monitored the daily energy expenditure, changes in body mass, diet, behavior and movement, finding that polar bears could be at risk of extinction during Arctic ice-free periods when they are forced to find food on land -- despite their ability to adapt their diets, hunting and foraging behaviors, a paper, published Tuesday in Nature, found.
The collar monitors indicated that individual polar bears chose different strategies to reduce energy loss during the ice-free periods, including fasting, reducing movement and resorting to eating berries and birds. The strategies were chosen independent of age, sex, reproductive stage or initial fat levels, according to the paper.
""The bears seem to be doing different things, regardless of their body condition,"" Pagano said. ""There is no real clear explanation for why a particular bear might be more active or less active.""
Some of the bears were ""highly sedentary"" and rested and fasted for the three-week monitoring period, Pagano said. However, most of the bears were ""highly active"" and moved about the landscape, feeding on a number of terrestrial foods, including bird carcasses, caribou carcasses, grass, seaweed and berries, he added.
""Regardless of which behavior strategy the bears were using, they all lost weight at similar rates, which highlighted that those bears were more active,"" Pagano said.. ""Basically, they were compensating for their higher activity levels through the terrestrial foods they were eating, but they weren't getting any net benefit from that.""
On average, the bears lost about 1 kilogram, or about 2.2 pounds, per day, Pagano said.
The findings suggest that polar bears obtain little benefit from foraging on land when it comes to prolonging the predicted time to starvation, as 19 of the 20 bears studied lost mass during that time, the researchers said.
If sea ice were available, the bears would typically gain weight because they have access to their preferred prey, Pagano said. Polar bears have perfected an efficient strategy called ""still hunting"" in which they rest near a breathing hole a seal will scratch open in the ice and wait there until a seal comes up to breathe -- when they pounce, he added.
At first glance, polar bears may not seem too different from their terrestrial cousins, like brown and black bears, John Whiteman, chief research scientist for Polar Bears International and assistant professor of biology at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, told ABC News. But from an evolutionary standpoint, polar bears have become ""backed into a corner"" by becoming specialized on the marine mammal prey, he said.
The food available on land is much less energy-dense, and the bears exert much more energy to catch terrestrial prey, Pagano said.
""Those terrestrial food sources these polar bears are taking in basically does them no good,"" Whiteman said.
In recent years, sea ice has begun to break up sooner in the springtime and summertime and does not re-form until much later in the fall. The availability of sea ice is about a month shorter than it was about 30 years ago, according to recent research.
""With climate change and sea ice loss, the fear that is slowly being realized is that ultimately polar bear populations will shrink in size and then in some places they will start to disappear entirely,"" Whiteman said.
This particular population of bears is spending about three weeks longer on land than they were in the 1980s, Pagano said.
""With forecasted declines in sea ice, the longer bears are on land, the more weight they're going to be losing, and they're at greater risk of starvation in the future,"" Pagano said.
While most of the modeling so far indicates that many of the polar bear populations are at risk of future climate warming, bears at the southern extent of their range are at greatest risk, Pagano said.
Younger bears are likely at the greatest risk of starvation, particularly subadults and dependent cubs, as they are not able to accumulate as much stored energy relative to adult bears that are larger and much more skilled at hunting, Pagano said.
Not all of the video footage captured on the collar cams contained bad news, Pagano said. Personalities were on full display as researchers documented adult males play fighting with each other, both on land and on water.
""We were pretty blown away by the video footage,"" Pagano said. ""There was a real variety of behaviors that the bears were exhibiting.""
Outfitting the bears with the collars is a feat in itself. Typically, female bears are collared, because the devices typically won't fit around a male's neck, Whiteman said.
From a helicopter, the bears are typically sedated using a dart once the researchers determine they are in a safe enough space. Once the bear is immobalized, the collars are then fastened and are programmed to detach at the end of the study period, Whiteman said.
""Fortunately, polar bears are such large animals that you can put a fairly robust collar on them with a solid battery to power something like a video camera and be pretty confident that it's not influencing their behavior,"" he said.
Drastically lowering greenhouse gas emissions, the main culprit behind global warming, is the key to ensuring the survival of the species, the experts said.
""It's really a matter of mitigating CO2 emissions,"" Pagano said."

The mRNA covid “vaccines” are unsafe. By the end of 2022, it was evident that there was a rise in excess deaths among the vaccinated. Yet it has been covered up by health agencies and corporate media.
Medical scientists who warned about the dangers of the vaccine were censored and known cures for covid such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine were suppressed – pharmacies refused to fill doctors’ prescriptions for these treatments.
What were the authorities’ motives? Was it a genocide agenda? Yes, but a lot of people simply can’t believe some people would push the genocide button, and take the moral high ground while doing it.
The world is faced with a monstrous criminal enterprise. Yet some people still don’t recognise it.
The following article was written a few months shy of two years ago. It’s worth reminding ourselves of articles such as these so we never forget what they have put us through.

The Covid “Vaccine” Is an Intentional Effort at World Genocide
By Paul Craig Roberts, 8 January 2023
Never before have there been massive excess deaths following vaccination. Never before have there been children, young adults, athletes in their prime, entertainers, dropping dead “cause unknown” following vaccination.
Of course, the cause is known. The leading doctors and medical scientists of our time – which excludes health agency bureaucrats, such as Anthony Fauci, who serve as marketing agents for Big Pharma and corrupt, politicised state medical boards and HMOs [health maintenance organisations] – have explained why and how the mRNA “vaccines,” which are not vaccines, kill, destroy the immune system, and cause health injuries. What is not known is why some die immediately after receiving the deadly substance, others a month later, and others remain, so far, alive. Some researchers think the content of the “vaccines” differed by lot and some think some of the injections were placebos for the purpose of producing an uninjured cadre to tout the safety of the injections.
Professor Michel Chossudovsky has collected here – ‘The Covid “Killer Vaccine”. People Are Dying All Over the World. It’s A Criminal Undertaking’ – a number of videos documenting the widespread sufferings and deaths of the vaccinated. It is not the unvaccinated who are “mysteriously” dropping dead all over the world. It is the vaccinated.
Yet the coverup continues. The western media – a collection of whores – are at work covering up for themselves as well as for Fauci, Biden, Bill Gates, Big Pharma, the FDA, NIH, CDC and the utterly corrupt and irresponsible medical profession. Big Pharma and the FDA continue to push injecting babies with the killer vaccine and there are still parents so utterly stupid and insouciant that they participate in the murder of their own children.
With people all over the world so stupid and so blindly trusting of authority, we can see why the satanic Bill Gates and satanic Klaus Schwab are confident that they can succeed in reducing the world population and effecting their Great Reset.
What do I mean when I say Gates and Schwab are satanic? Think about it this way. From time to time when discussing the subject, someone will say that people can be so awful they can understand why some would want to genocide them. I ask them if they would be willing to push the genocide button, and they say “no.” They understand that they have no right to cause people’s deaths in behalf of their opinion or a climate or ideological agenda. The difference between them and Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab is that Gates and Schwab are willing and eager to push the genocide button. What is so horrifying is that this willingness has acquired a high moral position. Exterminating people has become the way to save the planet.
The perpetrators of this mass murder are confident that their crime is too huge to be recognised as such. Naive populations simply won’t believe that “their” governments would do this to them. No one wants to admit that they executed their own family members and their own children by blindly trusting “authorities” who had announced their genocide agenda in advance.
In the United States, only a tiny percentage of the people have any idea what is happening. The time and energy of the population are used up in making ends meet and in entertaining themselves. They fall for one transparent crime after another. Whatever government announces they accept – President John Kennedy’s assassination, Senator Robert Kennedy’s assassination, the Gulf of Tonkin, 9/11, Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction, covid pandemic, “safe and effective” covid vaccine. They never learn.
Now they face genocide, and they still haven’t learned.
The perpetrators of mass genocide are still in control.
If it is not genocide, tell me what it is when distinguished medical scientists warn in advance about the mRNA “vaccine” and are censored and punished, when the inventor of the PCR “covid test” states that the test does not indicate the presence of the virus and is ignored, when the evidence of the harmful effects of the “vaccine” are kept secret by Pfizer and the FDA, when medical doctors are prevented from treating covid with known cures ivermectin and HCQ [hydroxycholorquine], when pharmacies refuse to fill doctors’ prescriptions for the cures, when illegal and unconstitutional mandates are used to force citizens under threat of loss of job to submit to being injected, when no official attention is paid to the massive increase in excess deaths among the vaccinated, when the media carries on a deceptive campaign of lies and propaganda?
Americans – indeed the world – are faced with a monstrous criminal enterprise. Do they have the strength and intelligence to recognise it? Are they going to do anything about it?

2827,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-03-07,"The last year has seen an onslaught of storms, crop-withering drought and devastating fires, as human-caused climate change – intensified by the naturally-occurring El Niño weather phenomenon – stoked warming to likely the hottest levels in over 100,000 years.
Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) service last month said the period from February 2023 to January 2024 marked the first time Earth had endured 12 consecutive months of temperatures 1.5 degrees Celsius hotter than the pre-industrial era.
That trend has continued, it confirmed in its latest monthly update, with February as a whole 1.77°C warmer than the monthly estimate for 1850-1900, the pre-industrial reference period.
Temperatures spiked across swathes of the planet in February, from Siberia to South America, with Europe also registering its second warmest winter on record.
In the first half of the month, daily global temperatures were ""exceptionally high"", Copernicus said, with four consecutive days registering averages 2°C higher than pre-industrial times – just months after the world registered its first single day above that limit.
This was the longest streak over 2°C on record, said C3S director Carlo Buontempo, adding the heat was ""remarkable"".
But it does not mark a breach of the 2015 Paris climate deal limit of ""well below"" 2°C and preferably 1.5°C, which is measured over decades.
Copernicus' direct data from across the planet goes back to the 1940s, but Buontempo said that taking into account what scientists know about historical temperatures ""our civilisation has never had to cope with this climate"".
""In that sense, I think the definition of uncharted territory is appropriate,"" he told AFP, adding global warming posed an unprecedented challenge to ""our cities, our culture, our transport system, our energy system"".
Ocean records
Sea surface temperatures were the highest for any month on record, Copernicus said, smashing the previous heat extremes seen in August 2023 with a new high of just over 21°C at the end of the month.
Oceans cover 70% of the planet and have kept the Earth's surface liveable by absorbing 90% of the excess heat produced by the carbon pollution from human activity since the dawn of the industrial age.
Hotter oceans mean more moisture in the atmosphere, leading to increasingly erratic weather, like fierce winds and powerful rain.
The cyclical El Niño, which warms the sea surface in the southern Pacific leading to hotter weather globally, is expected to fizzle out by early summer, Buontempo said.
He added that the transition to the cooling La Niña phenomenon may happen faster than expected, potentially decreasing the chances that 2024 will be another record-breaking year.
Fossil fuelled heat
While the El Niño and other effects have played a role in the unprecedented recent heat, scientists stressed that the greenhouse gas emissions that humans continue to pump into the atmosphere were the main culprit.
The UN's IPCC climate panel has warned that the world will likely crash through 1.5°C in the early 2030s.
Planet-heating emissions, mainly from the burning of fossil fuels, continue to rise when scientists say they need to fall by almost half this decade.
Countries at UN climate negotiations in Dubai last year agreed to triple global renewables capacity this decade and ""transition away"" from fossil fuels.
But the deal lacked important details, with governments now under pressure to strengthen their climate commitments in the short term and for beyond 2030.
""We know what to do – stop burning fossil fuels and replace them with more sustainable, renewable sources of energy,"" said Friederike Otto, of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment, Imperial College London.
""Until we do that, extreme weather events intensified by climate change will continue to destroy lives and livelihoods.""

3425,fake,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-09-20,"The case study published January 2022 in Schizophrenia Research touched on an 18-year-old female student who was sent to the hospital for ""irrelevant talk and bizarre behavior."" According to the paper, she had no history of physical illness or substance use. In fact, she had been perfectly healthy both physically and mentally before getting injected.
""While there have been numerous pieces of medical literature on the neurological side effects of the COVID-19 vaccinations, they often revolve around more physical ailments such as lethal headaches and seizures, paralysis, Bell's palsy, Alzheimer's [disease], Parkinson's [disease] and Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS),"" the case study noted, adding that the psychotic behavior exhibited by the woman would be classified within the category of neurological side effects.
""Over the period of [the] last few weeks, some of the serious side effects with various (COVID-19) vaccines have been documented in the form of GBS. There is limited data with respect to the psychiatric side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. Few case reports have documented new onset psychosis after the use of messenger-ribonucleic acid (mRNA) based COVID-19 vaccines."" (Related: The CONNECTION between AUTISM and COVID JABS could boil down to destruction of good gut bacteria.)
The researchers ultimately noted in their case study that ""considering the limited data, in this report we present a case of new onset psychosis, following the use of [the] Covishield vaccine."" Covishield is the local version of the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical firm's vaccine, manufactured and marketed by the Serum Institute of India.
""There was no notable difference in the gender distribution between these two groups of vaccine recipients. mRNA vaccines (all brands) were associated with almost 90.0 percent of the cardiac complications, whereas viral vector vaccines were associated with slightly over half (52.6 percent) of the neurological complications,"" the study reported.
""Nevertheless, 5.9 percent of cases with neurological complications and 2.5 percent of those with cardiac complications were fatal, underscoring the significance of the consistent surveillance and vigilant monitoring of vaccinated individuals to mitigate these occurrences.""
The researchers pointed out that other non-COVID-19 vaccinations have been documented to trigger psychosis as well. According to them, there are a few cases of post-vaccination psychosis linked to vaccines for rabies, yellow fever, smallpox, typhus and influenza.
For the 18-year-old woman in the case study, they attributed her post-vaccination psychosis to possible autoimmune encephalitis. Encephalitis is the swelling of the brain – in this case, being triggered by an autoimmune response to the vaccine.
InfoWars recently reported that viral vector COVID-19 vaccines have a higher rate of triggering neurological conditions when compared to mRNA-based injections, albeit by a small margin. The Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 injections make use of mRNA coated in lipid nanoparticles to deliver the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, while the AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines make use of an adenovirus vector.
But even the two adenoviral vaccines have differences. The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine received by the 18-year-old woman uses a monkey adenovirus, while the Janssen COVID-19 injection uses a human adenovirus.

5622,fake,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-05-27,"Zelensky's recent decision to make himself indefinite dictator by canceling Ukraine's elections means that Kiev is about as legitimate as U.S. Federal Reserve Notes (FRN), aka Monopoly-like money printed by the private Federal Reserve banking cartel.
Kiev is currently being run by a lawless and criminal regime, Medvedev explained. Zelensky's five-year mandate just expired, and instead of holding a new election as mandated under Ukrainian law, Zelensky used his February 2022 declaration of martial law to stay in office for as long as he wants.
""All these manipulations with laws mean only one thing: the death of the failed state of Ukraine – its transformation into a classic failed state, to use American vocabulary,"" Medvedev told TASS.
As for the United States and its allies, they continue to support the Zelensky regime because they are fearful, Medvedev says, about ""the shameful fall of his criminal regime.""
""That's why there is such a high probability that Zelensky would have lost his election miserably, and the citizens of his non-existent country would have wanted a new president in the hope that he would start peace negotiations with Russia,"" Medvedev added.
(Related: Did you know that 90 percent of all financial settlement transactions between Russia and China are now occurring in the two countries' respective national currencies as opposed to U.S. dollar?)

Zelensky is ""a political upstart,"" after all, having won his seat in 2019 only because he campaigned ""on the rhetoric of peace."" It turns out Zelensky lied – what else is new? – and now Ukraine has mountains of dead bodies and a failed state to show for it.
""They make good money from the bloody bacchanalia,"" Medvedev explained about how Western leaders are profiting from the bloodbath of Ukrainian soldiers whose bodies are piling up to the sky as Zelensky and his Western sponsors send them into the meat grinder.
All that taxpayer money and all those taxpayer-funded weapons the U.S. and other Western allies continue to funnel into Ukraine are mostly not ending up in the hands of anything even remotely good. And yet the West insists this is all an ""investment"" that will pay off – for them, anyway.
The regime should have changed in Ukraine on May 21, but as Medvedev predicted would happen there has been no change because Ukrainians no longer ""live in a rule-of-law state.""
""Law and justice were forgotten 10 years ago,"" he added about the sad state of affairs in Ukraine under Zelensky.
Zelensky's only remaining options are to either turn himself in and face trial or eventually be forcefully captured and face a potentially worse outcome – the choice is yours, Zelensky.
Zelensky will eventually meet the same fate as his ""spiritual teacher"" Stepan Bandera, a Ukrainian nationalist leader who sought to collaborate with Nazi Germany during World War II before being assassinated by Soviet operatives in Munich in 1959.
""What Mr. Medvedev is trying to say in layman's terms is that Ukraine is a totally screwed up nation under Zelensky and his Nazi goons,"" one RT commenter wrote.
""Zelensky confuses 'comic, 'cosmic,' and 'cosmetic,' and unfortunately he was no good at mathematics,"" wrote another. ""It's just a question of common sense and ethics.""
""'Zelensky was' because he knows he's already dead even though he's still alive,"" said another.
""This is why, folks, the Russian Empire was better than whatever Balkanized Eastern Europe that exists now,"" said someone else.

5823,fake,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-06-25,"This is according to comments made by Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his office. In his comments, Podolyak defended the Ukrainian attack on the beach in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol on the Black Sea.
“There are not and cannot be any ‘beaches,’ ‘tourist zones’ and other fictitious signs of ‘peaceful life’ in Crimea. Crimea is definitely a foreign territory occupied by Russia, where hostilities are taking place, a full-scale war is ongoing,” Podolyak wrote on his Telegram channel.
The United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization consider Crimea to be ""illegally annexed"" Ukrainian territory. Meanwhile, Russia considers the Crimean Peninsula to be rightful Russian land it has held since the time of the tsars and the Russian Empire.
The Russian Defense Ministry reports that Kyiv fired five ATACMS missiles supplied by the U.S. at Sevastopol on Sunday. Although Russian air defense systems managed to destroy four of them mid-air, the fifth one sustained damage before veering off course and detonating a cluster warhead above a beach that was packed with beachgoers.
At least four civilians have died, two of whom were children, and more than 150 were injured. An elderly woman who had been swimming in the sea at the moment of impact was also among those killed. In footage of the attack shared on social media, panicked tourists could be seen fleeing the beach and running for cover.

Podolyak added: “Crimea is also a large military camp and warehouse, with hundreds of direct military targets, which the Russians cynically try to mask and cover with their own civilians.""
He also said that Kyiv considers these civilians to be “occupiers”.
It’s the same type of rhetoric Israel has been using to defend the killing of Palestinians. When Podolyak said that Crimea is essentially a “big military camp” full of targets that Russian authorities are hiding behind civilians, it sounded a lot like what Israel has been saying Hamas is doing to justify the appalling number of civilians the Israeli military has killed in Gaza. (Related: Ukraine maintains ""enemies"" list of people to assassinate: Elon Musk, Laura Loomer, Scott Ritter and Donald Trump all named.)
The Kremlin wasted no time in labeling the act “terrorism” and pointed out that as the supplier of the missiles, the U.S. also has blood on its hands.
Russian envoy to the U.S. Anatoly Antonov said: “Cluster munitions in ATACMS missiles cannot be launched without the participation of American specialists and support from U.S. intelligence. It is no coincidence that enemy drones are circling over the Black Sea almost every day.”
Sevastopol is regularly a target of Ukrainian fire, and it is believed that the unusually high death and injury toll is related to a lack of air raid alerts before the strike.
The Russian Foreign Ministry has already summoned U.S. ambassador Lynne Tracy to answer for the attack, telling her that the “bloody atrocity” would “not go unpunished.”
“There will definitely be response measures,” they stated.
In addition to supplying the weapons, Russia maintains that American specialists set the flight coordinates of the missiles based on information gathered by American spy satellites.
The Kremlin had previously stated that the U.S.’s recent decision to allow Ukraine to use American-supplied weapons for striking targets inside Russian territory would incur “consequences” and could lead to an escalation in fighting.

6043,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-04-26,"A new study says it's likely a warmer world made downpours in Dubai earlier this month heavier.
Circumstantial evidence points to climate change as worsening the deadly deluge that just flooded Dubai and other parts of the Persian Gulf, but scientists didn't discover the definitive fingerprints of greenhouse gas-triggered warming they have seen in other extreme weather events, a new report found.
Between 10 per cent and 40 per cent more rain fell in just one day last week than it would have in a world without the 1.2 degrees Celsius from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas since the mid-19th century, scientists at World Weather Attribution said Thursday in a flash study that is too new to be peer-reviewed.
In at least one spot, a record 28.6 centimetres of rain fell in just 24 hours, more than twice the yearly average, paralysing the usually bustling city of skyscrapers in a desert.
Heavy rains and flooding killed at least two dozen people in the United Arab Emirates, Oman and parts of Saudi Arabia.
How does climate change impact rainfall?
One of the key tools in WWA's more than 60 past reports has been creating computer simulations that compare an actual weather event to a fictional world without climate change.
In the Dubai case there wasn’t enough data for those simulations to make such a calculation. But analysis of decades of past observations, the other main tool they use, showed the 10 per cent to 40 per cent bump in rainfall amounts.
Even without computer simulations, the clues kept pointing at climate change, scientists said.
“It’s not such a clear fingerprint, but we have lots of other circumstantial evidence, other lines of evidence that tell us that we see this increase,” said Imperial College of London climate scientist Friederike Otto, who coordinates the attribution study team.
“It’s what we expect from physics. It’s what we expect from other studies that have been done in the area, from other studies around the world, and there’s nothing else that’s going on that could explain this increase.”
There is a long-known effect in physics that finds the air holds 7 per cent more moisture with every degree Celsius.
Otto said she has confidence in the conclusion, but said this was one of the harder attribution studies the team has undertaken.
Flooding would not have happened without El Niño
El Niño, which is a natural occasional warming of the central Pacific that changes weather systems worldwide, was a big factor, the report said.
These heavy Gulf downpours have happened in the past but only during an El Niño. And the researchers said those past deluges seem to be trending heavier - something scientists have long said would happen in many parts of the world as the world warms.
This flooding, which came from two separate and near simultaneous storm systems, would not have happened without El Niño, said study co-author Mansour Almazroui of the Centre of Excellence for Climate Change Research (CECCR), King Abdulaziz University in Saudi Arabia. Nor would it have been like this without human-caused climate change, Otto added.
Because rainfall amounts varied over the region and the lack of data, the report couldn't put a figure on if climate change had increased the likelihood of downpours like this in Dubai, but Otto estimated that it's probably about three times more likely to happen now than in pre-industrial times.
Did cloud seeding play a part in Dubai's heavy rain?
The report and its authors threw cold water on speculation that UAE cloud seeding had anything to do with the amount of rain or its likelihood.
Many scientists dispute cloud seeding's effectiveness in general. Even so, the clouds in the storm system were not seeded, the report said. And the results of cloud seeding, if any, in general are more immediate, Otto said. And this storm was forecast days in advance.
“This type of rainfall never comes from cloud seeding,” Almazroui said in a Thursday news conference.
While the authors use well-established techniques and this is what scientists expect with climate change, when there's a disagreement between computer simulations and observations, conclusions shouldn't be drawn, said University of Victoria, Canada, climate scientist Andrew Weaver, who wasn't part of the research.
It's a strong enough case that greenhouse gas emissions are a factor, several other outside scientists said.
University of Melbourne, Australia, climate scientist Malte Meinshausen called Thursday’s study “a well-balanced, impressively detailed and adequately cautious assessment.”
“This work, when combined with theory and attribution studies associated with the increasingly frequent other extreme rain and flooding events around the world, makes the convincing case that climate warming supercharged the recent extreme rainfall and flooding event UAE and Oman,” said climate scientist Jonathan Overpeck, dean of the University of Michigan's environment school.
“This is what global warming increasingly looks like - more severe climate extremes and human suffering.”"
3552,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-08-19,"AAP FACTCHECK – Kamala Harris has vowed to decriminalise pedophilia if elected US president, social media posts claim.
This is false. The Democratic presidential nominee has made no such statement.
Several users have made the claim on Facebook as the current US vice president campaigns for the top job in the United States.
“Kamala Harris Vows To ‘Decriminalize Pedophilia’ if She Wins Presidency,” one post reads.
“Kamala Harris has vowed to decriminalize pedophilia in America if she wins the 2024 election this November.
“Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris’ pick as running mate, supports changing the law so that pedophilia is recognized as a legitimate ‘sexual orientation.'”
“Kambala wants to legalize pedophilia. A really huge red pill. Please wake up and quickly,” another post reads, referencing one of the nicknames Donald Trump uses for Ms Harris.
The claim is based on an article from The People’s Voice, a website AAP FactCheck has debunked several times.
The article’s only evidence for the claim is Ms Harris’s vice-president pick Tim Walz signing a bill to “modernize” the Minnesota Human Rights Act as governor of the state.
Several social media posts and Republican politicians made claims that the bill redefined sexual orientation to include pedophilia or protected pedophiles from discrimination in Minnesota.
This is also incorrect. Mr Walz signed the Take Pride Act in 2023 which removed the sentence “‘Sexual orientation’ does not include a physical or sexual attachment to children by an adult”.
State representative Leigh Finke, who introduced the bill, told Fox News Digital in April 2023 the change “updates outdated language that incorrectly ties pedophilia to a person’s sexual orientation”.
“Nothing in the bill changes or weakens any crimes against children, or the state’s ability to prosecute those who break the law,” she said.
“Of course, pedophilia is not a sexual orientation. The language never should have been included in the statutory definition in the first place.”
Pedophilia, which is defined as an ongoing sexual attraction to pre-pubescent children, is not a crime in itself.
However, acting on the attraction is and is broadly categorised as child sexual abuse. The bill does not change this.
Minnesota University law professor Richard Painter said the claim was simply wrong.
“Any sexual act with a child is a very serious felony in Minnesota. It’s child rape. The Take Pride Act changed none of that,” he said.
Under Minnesotan law, someone found guilty could face up to 30 years in jail.
There is also no evidence of Ms Harris, who was a prosecutor, saying she would decriminalise pedophilia if elected as president.
United States Studies Centre senior lecturer Kathryn Schumaker said claims that suggested protecting the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals harmed children were not new.
“Opponents of gay and lesbian rights often made spurious claims that prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation would endanger children,” Dr Schumaker said.
AFP FactCheck and Snopes have also debunked claims about Mr Walz signing a bill to protect pedophiles.

What was once just a “conspiracy theory” or “internet myth” confined to the fringes of society is now becoming official policy to keep the planet from “warming” or “boiling.”
We are talking about chemtrails and other forms of geoengineering, which those who propagate such things used to deny before eventually admitting that, yes, there are attempts being made to alter the function of the natural order to stop “climate change.”
Concepts like “dumping chemicals in the ocean” and “injecting reflective particles in the sky” are making headlines in prominent media outlets that once denied the existence of such things. Because of the alleged “climate crisis,” deranged scientists are coming up with bizarre ideas like blocking out the sun with poison, which they claim will protect Earth from melting.
(Related: Last summer, Mexico banned chemtrails and geoengineering after an American startup firm tried to block out the sun with chemicals in Baja California Sur.)
Just the other day, the Wall Street Journal reported on some of these newfangled projects, claiming that they stand to “reduce greenhouse gas emissions” at a much faster rate than existing technologies.
In order to stop “scary” things like heat waves, thunderstorms and floods, the climate industry is rushing to change the way clouds work and alter the pH levels of the ocean, among other large-scale planetary endeavors.
They still want everyone to stop eating meat and drive electric vehicles (EVs), of course, but those interventions are simply not enough to reach the “carbon-free economy” that they want to see take full shape by the year 2030.

One of the newest projects going on right now involves blasting a brine mixture into the sky to create larger, brighter clouds to reflect sunlight back into space. This project is taking place at Southern Cross University in Australia with funding from the government, other universities and various conservation organizations.
Across the world in Israel, a startup called Stardust Solutions is spending $15 million in private funding to blast reflective particles into the sky at high altitudes to try to reduce solar radiation. In the “next few months,” tests using the proprietary chemical blend will move from an indoor testing facility to the actual outdoors.
In the United States at Martha’s Vineyard, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute is planning to dump thousands of gallons of sodium hydroxide dyed with chemical colorings into the ocean to create a so-called “carbon sink” to draw carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the atmosphere and into the water.
Then there was the infamous “Make Sunsets” geoengineering effort in California that eventually made its way down to Mexico, prompting widespread criticism and outrage because of the sulfur and other harmful chemicals that were released into the atmosphere.
The climate cult is finally starting to admit that its efforts to reduce carbon are not working, so this is why they are shifting to more extreme measures like trying to block out the sun and recreate atmospheric gas concentrations and ratios to “fix” whatever they think is wrong with the climate.
Over at the United Nations (UN), there is also growing talk that the age of “global warming” has actually ended, and now the world is shifting into a period of “global cooling.”
“All of this is a clear sign that the ‘climate crisis,’ or rather the ‘climate crisis’ narrative, is entering a dangerous new phase,” warns the National Pulse.
“Rational thinking increasingly leads to alarmism and, ultimately, hysteria about impending doom. Under such conditions, the most unreasonable and ill-considered responses will seem reasonable and appropriate.”

6217,real,GENDER_BASED_DISINFORMATION,2024-08-21,"(Article by Calvin Freiburger republished from LifeSiteNews.com)
The platform, drafted before President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from reelection and given final approval without updating it to reflect that Biden has been replaced as presumptive nominee by Vice President Kamala Harris, spans 90 pages, casting a favorable light on the Biden-Harris administration’s record and laying out extensive plans on a range of issues for a second term.
Its “Reproductive Freedom” section (starting on page 48) begins by condemning the U.S. Supreme Court’s “extreme” 2022 overturn of Roe v. Wade. As a result, it says, “more than 20 states have imposed extreme and dangerous abortion bans – many of which include no exception even for rape or incest – that put the health and lives of women in jeopardy, force women to travel hundreds of miles for care, and threaten to criminalize doctors for providing the health care that their patients need and that they are trained to provide.”
Overturning Roe “has also had devastating consequences for families who have suffered the heartbreak of infertility,” it adds, by opening the door to state bans on in vitro fertilization (IVF), without acknowledging that Republicans from state legislatures all the way to presidential nominee Donald Trump rushed to protect IVF – to the consternation of pro-lifers who have grave concerns about the practice’s mass destruction of embryonic human beings.
By contrast, the platform touts Democrats “fighting back to restore reproductive freedom for every woman in every state,” with a recap of the administration’s “whole-of-government” campaign to preserve abortion-on-demand through executive orders, health regulations, legal advisories, and more. In particular, it highlights “defending access to emergency medical care, including clarifying that federal law on emergency care preempts state abortion bans, educating patients on their rights, making it easier for patients who have been denied emergency care to file a complaint, and ensuring hospitals meet their legal obligations to offer care.”
That passage refers to the administration’s lawsuit arguing that the federal Emergency Medical Treatment & Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires emergency room doctors to commit abortions that would otherwise be illegal under state law. Republicans argued that the White House misread and misapplied EMTALA in numerous ways, including that the law does not require procedures that violate state law, does not mandate services a particular hospital does not offer, and in fact requires hospitals to provide care for preborn children.
The platform then declares that if Trump returns to office, he “will ban abortion nationwide. And his allies plan to ban medication abortion nationwide, without Congress or the courts, by enforcing a law from the 1800s, including prosecuting women and doctors for sending or receiving medication abortion in the mail.” In fact, Trump has consistently said over the past several months he wants all future abortion battles left to individual states, going so far as to eliminate the Republican Party platform’s longstanding support for banning abortion nationwide, although he has sent mixed signals on what he would do about Biden’s abortion pill rules.
“With a Democratic Congress, we will pass national legislation to make Roe the law of the land again,” the section concludes. “We will strengthen access to contraception so every woman who needs it is able to get and afford it. We will protect a woman’s right to access IVF. We will repeal the Hyde Amendment. And in his second term, President Biden will continue to support access to FDA-approved medication abortion, appoint leaders at the FDA who respect science, and appoint judges who uphold fundamental freedoms.”
The platform underscores the choice facing pro-life voters in November between a GOP that has diminished pro-life enthusiasm with its work to dilute the pro-life cause and a Democrat Party as radical as ever on the issue, which is expected to leave most pro-lifers resigned to accept Trump as preferable to the alternative.
National polling aggregations by RealClearPolitics and RaceToTheWH currently indicate that Harris continues to lead Trump in both national polling and Electoral College projections since replacing Biden.

Missouri abortion-rights amendment faces last-minute legal challenges

COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) — Both sides of the debate over whether to enshrine abortion rights in Missouri’s constitution have filed last-minute legal challenges hoping to influence how, and if, the proposal goes before voters.
Missouri banned almost all abortions immediately after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. In response, a campaign to restore abortion access in the state is pushing a constitutional amendment that would guarantee a right to abortion.
Courts have until Sept. 10 to make changes to the November ballot, Secretary of State’s office spokesperson JoDonn Chaney said.
Facing the impending deadline, two Republican state lawmakers and a prominent anti-abortion leader last week sued to have the amendment thrown out.
Thomas More Society Senior Counsel Mary Catherine Martin, who is representing the plaintiffs, in a statement said Ashcroft’s office should never have allowed the amendment to go on November’s ballot. She said the measure does not inform voters on the range of abortion regulations and laws that will be overturned if the amendment passes.
“It is a scorched earth campaign, razing our state lawbooks of critical protections for vulnerable women and children, the innocent unborn, parents, and any taxpayer who does not want their money to pay for abortion and other extreme decisions that this Amendment defines as ‘care,’” Martin said.
Hearings in the case have not yet been scheduled.
The abortion-rights campaign is also suing Ashcroft over how his office is describing the measure.
“A ‘yes’ vote will enshrine the right to abortion at any time of a pregnancy in the Missouri Constitution,” according to ballot language written by the Secretary of State’s office. “Additionally, it will prohibit any regulation of abortion, including regulations designed to protect women undergoing abortions and prohibit any civil or criminal recourse against anyone who performs an abortion and hurts or kills the pregnant women.”
A lawsuit to rewrite that language argues that the measure allows lawmakers to regulate abortion after fetal viability and allows medical malpractice and wrongful-death lawsuits.
Ashcroft’s language is “intentionally argumentative and is likely to create prejudice against the proposed measure,” attorneys wrote in the petition.
Chaney said the Secretary of State’s office would stand by the measure’s current description and that “the court can review that information, as often happens.”
This is not the first time Ashcroft has clashed with the abortion-rights campaign. Last year, Missouri courts rejected a proposed ballot summary for the amendment that was written by Ashcroft, ruling that his description was politically partisan.
The lawsuit filed by the abortion-rights campaign is set to go to trial Sept. 4.
The Missouri amendment is part of a national push to have voters weigh in on abortion since the overturning of Roe v. Wade.
Measures to protect access have already qualified to go before voters this year in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Montana, Nevada and South Dakota, as well as Missouri.
Legal fights have sprung up across the country over whether to allow voters to decide these questions — and over the exact words used on the ballots and explanatory material. Earlier this week, Arkansas’ highest court upheld a decision to keep an abortion-rights ballot initiative off the state’s November ballot, agreeing with election officials that the group behind the measure did not properly submit documentation regarding the signature gatherers it hired.
Voters in all seven states that have had abortion questions on their ballots since 2022 have sided with abortion-rights supporters."
3593,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-09-19,"Many critics of the Georgian Dream-led government say the legislation flies in the face of the country's EU accession process.
In the run-up to the 26 October elections, the government of Georgia took yet another step further away from Brussels, adopting a draft law on ""Family Values and Protection of Minors"" that explicitly discriminates against LGBTQ+ people.
Mamuka Mdinaradze, chairman of the ruling Georgian Dream party, said that a legislative change was needed as a countermeasure to LGBTQ+ ""propaganda"".
""In two or three generations it can have such harmful consequences,"" he said, insisting that same-sex marriage can not be allowed and that if it were, the impact on Georgian society could be of a magnitude ""that no conqueror has been able to achieve for centuries"".
At a plenary session, the controversial law passed without objections, with 84 in favour and zero against.
Opposition parties were not present, as many have been boycotting the parliament ever since the adoption of the infamous ""foreign agents"" law earlier this year.
The anti-LGBTQ+ bill consists of about a dozen articles addressing marriage, adoption, and medical procedures, as well as dissemination of information, gatherings, and demonstrations in a further crackdown on the right to gather, according to activists.
Furthermore, the government has designated 17 May — the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia — as the day of ""Purity of the Family and Respect for Parents"".
The opposition remains divided on the new legislation, and has been cautious not to alienate socially conservative voters. Some of its opponents are not explicitly decrying the legislation as ""undemocratic"" and instead are criticising it as ""untimely"".
'Classic Russian propaganda'
The bill has been strongly criticised by many in Georgia's civil society.
Human rights defenders argue that the government is trying to distract its supporters from real problems and create another barrier to European integration.
""This is classic Russian propaganda, where the government invents a non-existent problem and promises to solve it,"" said Eka Chitanava, the director of the Institute of Tolerance and Diversity. ""There are many social problems in Georgia that create an unfavourable environment which also affects minors.""
""This law, on the one hand, puts the LGBTQ+ community — already the most marginalised group in the country — in an even more vulnerable position. On the other hand, it damages the state of human rights for all citizens.”
Civil society groups claim that the law, which resembles legislation enacted in Russia, encroaches on freedom of speech while also legalising censorship.
""What Russia has been working toward for ten years, Georgian Dream has offered us directly,"" said Khatia Ghoghoberidze, a member of the Georgian Journalism Charter Council.
""Russia was moving toward this step by step,"" Ghoghoberidze told Euronews. ""The Georgian Dream brought us a version that is in place in Russia today, and the parliament adopted this law.
""I'll say it directly: it's just a shame."""

(Spenser Heaps/The Deseret News via AP, File)
TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — A federal judge’s order blocking a Biden administration rule for protecting LGBTQ+ students from discrimination applies to hundreds of schools and colleges across the U.S., and a group challenging it hopes to extend it further to many major American cities.
U.S. District Judge John Broomes’ decision touched off a new legal dispute between the Biden administration and critics of the rule, over how broadly the order should apply. Broomes, who was appointed to the bench by then-President Donald Trump, blocked enforcement of the rule in Kansas, where he’s based, as well as in Alaska, Utah and Wyoming. In addition, he blocked it for any K-12 school or college in the U.S. attended by children of members of three groups backing Republican efforts nationwide to roll back LGBTQ+ rights.
Most Republican state attorneys general have sued to challenge the rule, which is set to take effect in August under the 1972 Title IX civil rights law that bars sex discrimination in education. Broomes and other judges have blocked the rule’s enforcement in 15 states so far while legal cases move forward.
Broomes directed the groups challenging the rule in the Kansas case — Moms for Liberty, Young America’s Foundation and Female Athletes United — to provide a list of schools and colleges where enforcement would be blocked. On Monday, the groups submitted a list of more than 400 K-12 schools and nearly 700 colleges in at least 47 states and the District of Columbia. About 78% of the K-12 schools and many of the colleges are in states not covered by any judge’s ruling.
But in a filing last week, attorneys for Moms for Liberty called compiling a list of schools for its 130,000 members “an impossible task” and asked Broomes to block the rule in any county where a group member lives. Co-founder Tiffany Justice said in a court filing that the group doesn’t ask members to list their children’s schools to protect their privacy.
“Individual members of Moms for Liberty are regularly subject to threats, both general and specific,” Justice said in her statement.
In seeking a broader order from Broomes, Moms for Liberty included a list of more than 800 counties where members live, from every state except Vermont and the District of Columbia. Should Broomes approve the group’s request, the rule would be blocked in Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Detroit, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, Philadelphia, San Francisco and New York City, except for the Bronx.
Biden administration attorneys said the request would apply to dozens of schools without children of Moms for Liberty members for every school with such students.
“Thus, granting relief at the county level instead of the school level could increase the scope of the injunction by perhaps a hundred-fold,” the attorneys said in a court filing.
Broomes called the rule arbitrary and said it exceeded the authority granted to federal officials by Title IX. He also concluded that it violated the free speech rights and religious freedom of parents and students who reject transgender students’ gender identities.
The Biden administration has appealed Broomes’ ruling to the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver. LGBTQ+ youth, their parents, health care providers and others say restrictions on transgender youth harms their mental health.
The administration has said the rule does not apply to athletics, but Republicans argue that the rule is a ruse to allow transgender girls and women to play on girls’ and women’s sports teams, which is banned or restricted in at least 25 states.
The Biden administration attorneys also worry that Moms for Liberty can expand the scope of Broomes’ order by recruiting new members online. On Monday, they asked Broomes not to apply his order to a school if a student’s parent joined after Monday.
The website for joining the group said that joining by Monday ensured that “your child’s school is included” in Broomes’ order."

The device, developed by Swiss medical technology firm Onward, delivers an electrical current through electrodes placed on the skin of paralysed patients near where their spinal cord was damaged.
After two months of therapy, 43 of the 60 people participating in the trial regained strength and ability to use their arms and hands, according to the study in the journal Nature Medicine.

""I think it could be life-changing for the majority of people with spinal cord injury,"" lead study author US neuroscientist Chet Moritz told a press conference.
The field has seen a number of leaps forward in recent years, with electrical stimulation of the spinal cord allowing several patients to regain the ability to walk.
However, these devices require invasive surgery to implant devices near the spinal cord.
While the simpler device behind Monday's announcement may seem less revolutionary, several of the trial participants emphasised how important the use of hands are to paralysed people.
""Everyone thinks that for a spinal injury, all you want to do is be able to walk again,"" said Melanie Reid, a British journalist and trial participant who was paralysed when she fell off a horse 15 years ago.
""But if you're tetraplegic or quadriplegic, what matters most is working hands,"" she told the press conference.
Reid said she was ""delighted"" with the device, which allowed her to grip and even scroll through her phone using her left hand.
Another participant, Sherown Campbell, said the device helped him improve his typing speed, cook and write, as well as other things that enhanced his ""quality of life"".
Pilates for your fingers
Reid said that training with the device was hard work, comparing it to ""doing a Pilates class with your fingers"".
Moritz explained that this work develops new connections between the brain and the affected limbs, increasing the benefits over time -- even when the device is not connected.
The study also stood out because of its size -- most trials of similar devices have only involved one or a handful of patients.
French neuroscientist Gregoire Courtine, who supervised the study, told AFP it was the ""first in the history of spinal cord medicine to show safety and efficacy in improving the recovery of tetraplegics"".
Courtine said Onward was in discussion to get the device approved in the United States, with hopes that it could get to market there by the end of the year. Europe would ideally then follow soon after, he added.
In contrast, implants that could let paralysed people walk again are still likely years away from being widely available.
The price for Onward's device remains unknown, though Courtine said the aim was for it to be ""accessible"".

6162,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-08-10,"LGBTQ+ rights in Germany: Protected in the constitution?August 10, 2024
In July, hundreds of thousands of people marched in Berlin on Christopher Street Day in support of recognizing the rights of LGBTQ+ people. The abbreviation LGBTQ+ stands for lesbian, gay, and queer people, but also includes those with other identities, such as people who are intersex, asexual, bisexual or transgender.
Among them is Wanja Kiber. Originally from Kazakhstan, he spoke with DW during the CSD about his life story.
""We came to Germany, and I came out pretty quickly. And my parents' first reaction was to take tranquilizers, say nothing, cry and avoid talking about it. How did that feel, to not be able to tell anyone about it, to feel I was not right? To be considered a criminal, a sick person? To not exist at all?""
Protection of sexual and gender identity
But meanwhile, added Kiber, his father is not only proud of him but has become an advocate for LGBTQ+ rights himself. For him, it's a small success story — but not everyone is as resilient and as lucky. This is another reason for one of the key demands at Christopher Street Day: the ban on discrimination because of sexual orientation must be expressly written into the German constitution.
Well-known German pop singer Herbert Grönemeyer spoke at Christopher Street Day, saying that article 3 of the German constitution should be amended to read ""that no one can be discriminated against because of their gender or sexual identity."" We must persevere and continue to have courage, the singer shouted into the crowd.
Amendment only possible with a two-thirds majority
Currently, article 3 of the German constitution states: ""No person shall be favored or disfavored because of gender, parentage, race, language, homeland and origin, faith or religious or political opinions."" Sexual identity is, therefore, not explicitly mentioned.
The agreement signed in December 2021 by the governing coalition partners the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), the Greens and the neoliberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) indicated their intention to change the wording. The problem is that any change to the constitution requires a two-thirds majority in both the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, and the Bundesrat, which represents the federal states.
However, the three governing parties do not hold two-thirds of the seats in parliament, meaning they need the support of the largest opposition parties, the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU)and Christian Social Union (CSU). And these parties don't think much of the idea.
Conservative CDU doesn't 'see any reason to amend the constitution'
""Changing the list of basic rights, in other words, the heart of our constitution, should only be done for very special reasons,"" Thorsten Frei, parliamentary secretary for the CDU/CSU group in the Bundestag, told media outlet Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland. ""But I also don't see any reason to amend the constitution, since protection against discrimination on the basis of gender is already enshrined in article 3.""
Dirk Wiese, the deputy leader of the SPD parliamentary group, was not satisfied with Frei's response. ""Unfortunately, the CDU/CSU group in the Bundestag has refused to enter into talks on this issue. We therefore applaud those CDU politicians from the federal states who have taken a different position,"" he said.
Wiese was referring specifically to Berlin Mayor Kai Wegner, of the CDU. Under his leadership, the Berlin Senate already announced in 2023 a Bundesrat initiative to amend article 3. At Christopher Street Day in 2023, Wegner said: ""We want to amend article 3 of the constitution. Sexual identity must be included. That is my promise.""
However, since then nothing has happened.
Following opposition from the CDU, numerous coalition representatives have nevertheless made efforts to once again push for a constitutional amendment. A constitutional amendment would be ""an important sign of political and social acceptance,"" lawmaker Konstantin Kuhle told RND on behalf of the FDP party.
""A constitutional amendment is long overdue at this point,"" he added.
Inclusion would be an important step for social acceptance, say advocates
The Lesbian and Gay Association of Germany (LSVD)has also pointed out for years that an amendment could put an end to the decades of discrimination that homosexuals and bisexuals have faced in postwar Germany.
In 1949, when the constitution was first drafted and ratified, homosexuals and bisexuals were the only victims of National Socialism to be deliberately excluded from the constitution. Homosexuals were persecuted under section 175 of the German Penal Code, a section that was only fully scrapped in 1994.
Internationally, much has been done to protect the rights of LGBTQ+ communities. In Europe, for example, 22 countries recognize same-sex marriage, compared to 16 outside of Europe. Same-sex marriages became possible in Germany on October 1, 2017, after years of heated debate.
Only 20 countries worldwide have gender self-determination laws in place. And the sad reality is that LGBTQ+ people face legal discrimination in a third of countries worldwide.

Official figures published by the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have claimed Russia experienced the deadliest day of it war yet on Monday, with 1,950 killed or wounded. The figure dropped slightly on the 24 hours of Tuesday, with Ukraine claiming to have inflicted 1,770 casualties on Russian forces.
Over the two days, Ukraine states it has destroyed 47 Russian tanks and 130 armoured fighting vehicles, 81 of them on Monday alone. The high casualties are largely down to the Russian counter-counter offensive to recapture its own territory in Kursk, a battle to which North Korean Troops have also been deployed.
The alleged casualty toll for Monday, if correct, is double the rolling daily average said to have been inflicted on Russia this time last year and over five times that experienced by Kremlin forces even in the first days of the conflict back in March to April 2022.
The colossal increase in daily killed and injured underlines the change of tactics from rapid manoeuvre warfare in the early days of the war as Russia attempted to rush Kyiv and capture the centre of government before a resistance was able to fully generate to the attrition warfare of alleged ‘human wave’ tactics of today.
As ever in war time, the truth of casualty figures is a matter of morale and a closely guarded secret for both sides. Nevertheless, Western intelligence agencies including Ukraine’s directorate seek to assess the degree to which the war is sapping Russia’s reserves and ability to fight. Ukraine claims Russia has now suffered over 714,000 casualties — killed and injured — since the war began, which is broadly in line — if a little higher — than an estimate produced by the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence at the start of October of “likely” 648,000 killed and wounded in action.
As recently as this past weekend, the United Kingdom publicly put Russian casualties at approaching, but not yet at 700,000. These in turn are an increase in Ukraine’s claim to have inflicted half a million casualties on the Russian Federation back in the Spring.
While Russia’s casualties are widely and frequently discussed, how the Ukrainian military is faring is less often a matter of public speculation by the supporting governments and media of the West. Kyiv has not made a habit of publishing its own figures, but President Zelensky did state in February 2024 — the second anniversary of the conflict beginning — that there has been 31,000 Ukrainians killed in action.
More recently, intelligence agencies-adjacent U.S. publication the Wall Street Journal put the figure close to half a million Ukrainian killed and wounded in the Autumn. The United Stated government is more conservative at around 300,000, while Russia inevitably claims the largest numbers, with over half a million stated in the Spring. Russia claims to have taken out over 32,000 in the Battle of Kursk alone, as well as hundreds of tanks."
3949,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-10-21,"AAP FACTCHECK – The coastal town of Port Hedland in Western Australia has seen a 700 per cent increase in deaths following the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, according to claims online.
This is false. Deaths decreased in 2021 – the year COVID-19 vaccines were introduced – compared to the previous year, before rising slightly again in 2022.
The vaccines have been linked to just 14 deaths across the entire country.
The claim is being shared on social media following an October 11 meeting of the Port Hedland council, at which councillors voted 5-2 to pass a motion calling on state and federal governments to suspend COVID-19 vaccinations.
Social media posts supporting the council’s decision are claiming the area has seen a dramatic increase in deaths since the vaccines were introduced.
“Last week in West Australia (Port Hedland) a local council became the first ever to vote for WITHDRAWAL OF MRNA COVID VACCINES in Australia,” one Facebook post states.
“This snip of the meeting shares a local anecdote of an unprecedent [sic] 700% INCREASE IN DEATHS in the local area, since the roll out of the Covid vaccines.”
The post includes a clip of the meeting’s live stream in which councillor Adrian McRae, who introduced the motion, recounts a claimed conversation with an unnamed funeral director (one hour 36 minutes 48 seconds).
“My own company, GBTK, here in Hedland, has just finished the construction of a cold body storage facility here in Wedgefield … I spoke with the company owners, who we built it for, another local Pilbara funeral director.
“They told me that in 2020 at the height of COVID that they were doing on average one funeral a week. One. Since the injection rollout they are doing over one funeral a day. It’s almost a seven-fold increase,” he says.
Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) shows the claim of a 700 per cent increase in deaths is wrong.
The latest data on deaths in Australia was released on October 10, 2024, and includes figures for each local government area.
Port Hedland recorded 62 deaths in 2019, 46 in 2020, 43 in 2021, 69 in 2022 and 58 in 2023 (table 5).
In the years leading up to the pandemic and subsequent vaccine rollout, the general pattern was similar with fluctuations from year to year but a general steady upward trend.
This trend is mirrored by an increase in the area’s population. According to the same ABS dataset, the population went from 12,945 in 2000 to 14,624 in 2010 and then 16,115 in 2020.
In 2021 it was 16,666 and then 17,247 in 2023.
When the total population is taken into account, the rate of deaths per 1000 people is slowly falling. This includes a slight drop in 2021 from the previous year and then a rise in 2022 – both in keeping with historic year-on-year variations.
Queensland University of Technology statistician Adrian Barnett said no matter which way you look at the figures, there has not been a 700 per cent increase in deaths.
Regardless, he urged caution of making too much of year-on-year percentage increases and decreases with such small numbers.
Prof Barnett said it would only take one more or less death each year to shift the percentage figure for the Port Hedland area.
Australian National University demographer Sergey Timonin agreed that analysing trends is difficult when the number of deaths is so small.
The best way to illustrate changes in mortality is through the standardised death rate, which takes into account the size and age structure of the population, Dr Timonin told AAP FactCheck.
However, the ABS dataset for Port Hedland doesn’t include this figure for most years because the figures were so small.
While Australia recorded more deaths than expected in 2022, the cause has been attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious diseases plus delayed healthcare – not vaccination.
The Therapeutic Goods Administration has identified 14 cases in which the cause of death was linked to vaccination from the 1004 reports received and reviewed, with no new vaccine-related deaths identified since 2022.
The Verdict
False – The claim is inaccurate.

6126,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-10-31,"The United States said on October 31 that it has information that some 8,000 North Korean soldiers are now in Russia’s Kursk region near the border with Ukraine, and Russia ""fully intends"" to deploy them in combat against Ukrainian troops.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told a briefing at the State Department that the United State expects the troops to be sent to the front in the coming days. Blinken reiterated that they would become ""legitimate military targets"" if they are deployed.
The deployment was at the top of the agenda as Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin hosted talks with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun.
Russia has been training the North Korean troops on artillery, drones, and basic infantry operation, including trench-clearing, ""indicating they fully intend to use these forces in frontline operations,"" Blinken said at the briefing.
""One of the reasons that Russia is turning to these North Korean troops is that it's desperate. [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has been throwing more and more Russians into a meat grinder of his own making in Ukraine,"" Blinken said.
Now, Blinken said, Putin is turning to North Korean troops, ""and that is a clear sign of weakness.""
He added that Russia has been suffering some 1,200 casualties a day in eastern Ukraine, more than at any other time during the war.
The meeting that he and Austin held with their South Korean counterparts showed that the United States is focusing increasingly ""on the indivisibility of the security"" that exists between the United States and its allies in the Indo-Pacific, Blinken said.
Austin called the deployment of North Korean troops and Pyongyang's test-firing of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) early on October 31 ""reckless developments."" North Korea announced early in the day that it had test-fired one of its newest and most powerful missiles to boost its nuclear deterrent.
The United States, South Korea, and Japan earlier on October 31 released a joint statement condemning the ICBM test-launch as a “flagrant violation” of numerous UN Security Council resolutions.
“We strongly urge [North Korea] to immediately cease its series of provocative and destabilizing actions that threaten peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and beyond,” they said.
In response to the test-launch, the United States will work to increase the interoperability of U.S. and South Korean forces, strengthen deterrence, and deepen nuclear and strategic planning efforts through the Nuclear Consultative Group, Austin said. The United States also will increase its regular deployment of U.S. strategic assets on the Korean Peninsula, he added.
The deployment of the North Korean troops to Russia has fueled concerns that it will further destabilize the Asia-Pacific region and broaden Moscow's war on Ukraine. South Korea has raised questions about what new military technologies North Korea might get from Russia in exchange for supplying troops.
There is a “high possibility” that North Korea will ask for advanced technologies from Russia in exchange for its troops, Kim said.
Russia has had to shift some resources to the Kursk border region to respond to a Ukrainian incursion launched in August, and its forces have struggled to push back the Ukrainian troops.
The United States has estimated there are about 10,000 North Korean troops in Russia now. Seoul and its allies assess that the number has increased to 11,000, while Ukraine has put the figure higher, at up to 12,000. Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang have directly acknowledged the deployment.
The United States challenged Russia at the United Nations on October 31 on the developments, with Deputy U.S. Ambassador Robert Wood demanding an explanation from Russian Ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzya about the presence of the 8,000 troops in Kursk.
RFE/RL's Ukraine Live Briefing gives you the latest developments on Russia's invasion, Western military aid, the plight of civilians, and territorial control maps. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.
""I have a very respectful question for my Russian colleague: Does Russia still maintain that there are no [North Korean] troops in Russia?"" Wood asked.
Nebenzya had no response, but at a Security Council meeting on October 30 he brushed off the reports about North Korean troops as ""mere assertions"" and questioned why Russia's allies like North Korea could not help Moscow in its war against Ukraine when Western countries claim the right to help Kyiv.
Nebenzya also said that any Russian interaction with North Korea would be ""in line with international law.""
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he believes if there is no reaction to the deployment of North Korean troops, Russia will bring more of them into the conflict.
""When the West and various partners did not react to Putin's occupation of our Crimean Peninsula 10 years ago, there were no loud steps, [only] very quiet statements,"" Zelenskiy said.
Putin followed by launching the full-scale invasion. It is the same pattern with the North Korean troops, Zelenskiy said.
""Putin is checking the reaction of the West,"" he said."
3001,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-04-11,"Ukraine’s parliament passed a law Thursday that will govern how the country recruits new conscripts, following months of delay and after thousands of amendments were submitted to water down the initial draft.
Lawmakers dragged their feet for months over the law, which is expected to be unpopular. The law was spurred by a request from Ukraine’s military, which wanted to mobilize up to 500,000 more troops, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in December.
Exhausted soldiers, on the front lines since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, had no means to rotate out for rest, while many thousands of Ukrainian men evade the draft.
The law was passed to the backdrop of an escalating Russian campaign that has devastated Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in recent weeks. Authorities said Russian overnight missile and drone attacks again struck infrastructure and power facilities across several regions and completely destroyed the Trypilska thermal power plant, the largest power generating facility in Kyiv region.
The law brings into effect a host of changes to the current system by expanding the powers of Ukrainian authorities to issue draft notices using an electronic system.
Incumbent army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi and Zelenskyy have since revised that figure after conducting an audit, saying the number needed was not as high because soldiers can be rotated from the rear.
Former army commander Valerii Zaluzhnyi’s dismissal from his post was reportedly over the mobilization issue.
The vote came after parliament’s defense committee removed a key provision from the draft Tuesday that would ensure the rotation of servicemen after 36 months of combat, a move that surprised some lawmakers as it had been a promise of the Ukrainian leadership.
Lawmaker Oleksii Honcharenko said in a Telegram post that he was shocked by the move to remove the provision. It was likely taken out because, considering the scale and intensity of the war against Russia, it would prove difficult to implement. Ukraine already suffers from a lack of trained recruits capable of fighting, and demobilizing soldiers on the front lines now would deprive Ukrainian forces of their most capable fighters.
On Wednesday, the parliamentary defense committee instructed the Defense Ministry to draft a comprehensive bill on demobilization of military personnel within the next eight months, news reports cited ministry spokesperson Dmytro Lazutkin as saying.
In nighttime missile and drone attacks, at least 10 of the strikes damaged energy infrastructure in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said more than 200,000 people in the region were without power and Russia “is trying to destroy Kharkiv’s infrastructure and leave the city in darkness.”
In the Odesa region, four people were killed and 14 injured in Russian missile strikes Wednesday evening, said regional governor Oleh Kiper.
Energy facilities were also hit in the Zaporizhzhia and Lviv regions."
2204,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-04-18,"While NATO allies had made ""encouraging"" recent commitments on military support, he said: ""We should have given them more earlier.""
He was speaking to reporters ahead of a working session on Ukraine, also attended by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.
Ukraine has struggled on the battlefield for months, outgunned and outnumbered by Russian forces amid a shortage of Western military aid.
Stoltenberg said there had been ""important, encouraging signs"" of new military support from NATO allies, including the scheduling of a US Congressional vote this weekend on a long-stalled $61-billion package of aid.
""It's of vital importance that NATO allies sustain and step up their support. We will focus today on air defence. There's an urgent, critical need for more air defence,"" Stoltenberg said.
(AFP)"
6085,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-10-01,"Former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte immediately pledged his strong support for Ukraine as he took over as the head of NATO on October 1 at a pivotal time in the military alliance's history as Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbor approaches the 1,000-day mark.
Rutte, the longest-serving prime minister in the history of the Netherlands, met with outgoing Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg at NATO headquarters in Brussels, where they laid a wreath to fallen personnel from the alliance as they were surrounded by the flags of its 32 member countries.
They then proceeded into the great hall where top-level North Atlantic Council meetings are held, with Stoltenberg, who leaves after a decade at NATO's helm, presented him with a Viking gavel to use when chairing meetings.
""There can be no lasting security in Europe without a strong, independent Ukraine,"" Rutte told the hall in his first speech in office, giving an affirmation of the commitment made by the organization's leaders in 2008 that ""Ukraine's rightful place is in NATO.""
""We have to make sure that Ukraine prevails as a sovereign, independent, democratic nation,"" Rutte told reporters afterward.
NATO, founded in 1949 to deter and defend against any attack on its members in Western Europe by the Soviet Union, has found itself back in the diplomatic spotlight due to the war in Ukraine and a Russia, led by its autocratic president, Vladimir Putin.
Rutte appears to enjoy close relations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
As Dutch prime minister, he helped get F-16 fighter aircraft sent to Ukraine, secured stronger EU economic sanctions on Moscow despite Dutch dependency on trade, and helped move Ukraine along the path toward EU membership.
The Ukrainian leader applauded Rutte's taking the helm of the alliance, saying he ""looks forward to working"" together to strengthen Euro-Atlantic security as Ukraine continues on its path towards full-fledged NATO membership.
""Only together, Ukraine and its allies, can we truly guarantee a peaceful, stable, and secure Europe,"" he said in a post on X.
But Rutte, the 57-year-old Hague-born politician known for his affable manner, faces the tricky question of whether Ukraine will get an invitation to join NATO.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow that Putin knew Rutte well from previous meetings and that no change in policy is expected.
""Our expectations are that the North Atlantic alliance will continue to work in the same direction in which it has been working,"" he said.
""At one time, there were hopes for the possibility of building good pragmatic relations -- at least, such a dialogue was conducted -- but subsequently we know that the Netherlands took a rather irreconcilable position, a position on the complete exclusion of any contacts with our country,"" he added.
Adding to the balancing act, Rutte takes over NATO just over a month before the United States, the alliance’s biggest funding source, holds a presidential election between Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump.
The former president has been critical of NATO and has not said whether he wants Kyiv to come out victorious in repelling the Kremlin's invasion. Harris has supported continuing to send arms to help Ukraine fight back.
""I know both candidates very well.... I will be able to work with both. Whatever is the outcome of the election,"" he said.
""I worked for four years with Donald Trump. He was the one pushing us to spend more (on defense), and he achieved because indeed, at the moment, we are now at a much higher spending level than we were when he took office,"" Rutte added, noting Harris had a ""fantastic record"" as vice president and is ""a highly respected leader."
5450,real,ANTI_MIGRATION_AND_XENOPHOBIA,2024-08-08,"In recent weeks there has been significant political and social unrest in the UK, sparked by the tragic stabbing deaths of several young girls in Southport. These girls were knifed to death by a murderous teenager who was part of the last wave of mass migration into the UK. This incident has ignited a series of violent anti-mass migration protests across the country. People are fed up. In response, the UK government has doubled down on their support for unchecked migration, while showing no remorse for the stabbing deaths of the young girls -- citizens -- inside their borders. Since the anti-migration protests began, the UK has adopted a hard-line stance against these demonstrations, aiming to clamp down on what it describes as violent disorder and potential terrorism linked to the unrest. So far, about 400 people have been arrested and 100 face charges.
Now the UK is looking to take on anyone overseas who supports these anti-migration protests, threatening to extradite individuals who speak out of line with their authority. This move, spearheaded by the UK's Director of Public Prosecutions, Stephen Parkinson, and endorsed by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, represents a significant expansion of the British legal system, as they attempt to police the world, well beyond their borders, and through social media channels.
Stephen Parkinson is making headlines by declaring that individuals abroad who support or incite violence related to these protests are not immune from prosecution.
""Some people are abroad. That doesn’t mean they’re safe,"" Parkinson asserted, highlighting the potential for international extradition and legal consequences, regardless of an individual’s location.
Individuals charged with violent disorder could face up to five years in prison, while those found guilty of rioting could be sentenced to up to ten years. Additionally, the government is prepared to pursue terrorism charges against those involved in planning or inciting serious disruptions for ideological purposes.
Parkinson said the British government has established liaison prosecutors worldwide to assist with international collaboration on such cases. Parkinson warned social media users who protest the government’s migration policies “they are not safe and there is nowhere to hide.” This tyrannical move is likely to strain diplomatic relations as it tests the limits of international extradition agreements, free speech and basic human rights.
One of the UK’s most-likely targets is Tommy Robinson, a well-known activist who protests corrupt government policies that enable gang-related activity. He is known as the founder of the English Defense League, which organizes street demonstrations to protest against radical Islamic extremism. He is currently residing in Cyprus. He recently missed a court appearance related to contempt of court charges, and faces an arrest warrant from England’s High Court. UK authorities have not confirmed whether he will be among those targeted for extradition in relation to the recent protests, but it wouldn’t be the first time he was targeted for his speech and activism.
The UK’s initiative to prosecute individuals abroad for their speech and actions related to domestic unrest sets a new precedent and puts pressure on social media companies to censor individuals, much like how the U.S. government coordinated censorship during the COVID-19 scandal. No truth is allowed on the topic. Groups that organized freedom marches and spoke about vaccine injury were censored from social media channels.
The founder of social media company X, Elon Musk, has made his intentions clear on the current matter in the UK. He accused the UK Prime Minister of enforcing a ""two-tier"" system of policing. Musk points out that Starmer is applying unequal treatment against anti-mass migration protesters while giving the green light to counter-demonstrators from the Muslim community. How will the UK target Musk for daring to speak out of line? Ironically, freedom of speech will be the force that submits the UK government, and politicians there will be forced to deal with the scourges of unchecked migration and the ensuing crime and civil unrest that their policies caused.

3795,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-10-09,"Most high school students say they've had a traumatic experience as a kid
It's far more common to live through childhood trauma than to grow up without it.
A new study found that 3 in 4 high school students experienced at least one potentially traumatic event involving violence, abuse or exposure to mental health or substance use problems.
And, notably, 1 in 5 high school students said they experienced at least four of these potentially traumatic events.
Health experts call these events adverse childhood experiences, or ACEs, and they've been shown to increase the risk of developing chronic health problems and mental health struggles in adulthood.
The report, published Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, offers a deeper look at a 2023 Youth Risk Behavior Survey of 20,000 public and private high school students nationwide.
It marks the first time the CDC surveyed respondents about childhood trauma while they’re still in high school rather than surveying them later in adulthood or asking parents.
“It means that it’s timely data,” said Dr. Allison Arwady, director of the CDC’s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. “I’m excited about this work because it lets us think concretely about what we can do to get ahead of those problems.”
Teen mental health: The CDC reports improvement. But the kids are far from all right.
In the survey, the students were asked about examples of emotional, physical and sexual abuse; physical neglect; intimate partner violence, substance abuse or poor mental health in the household; and the incarceration of a parent or guardian.
Emotional abuse surpassed all other traumas, affecting more than 61% of students. Physical abuse and poor mental health in the household were second and third.
Researchers found ACEs varied by gender, with teen girls reporting more events than boys.
The results also varied by race and ethnicity.
American Indian and Alaskan Native students were the most likely to witness intimate partner violence and substance abuse. Asian and Black students were more likely to experience physical abuse.
The study authors also asked students about negative health outcomes, such as obesity, and risky behaviors, such as binge drinking.
They found students who experienced at least one ACE were likelier to experience these conditions and behaviors than students who reported zero ACEs. Preventing traumatic events could reduce a person's chances of considering suicide by 85%, misusing prescription opioids by 84%, carrying a weapon at school by 65% and binge drinking by 64%.
Students who experienced four or more ACEs were at the greatest risk of suicide attempts and misuse of prescription opioids.
Preventing ACEs can also reduce the risk of health conditions, including asthma, kidney disease, stroke, coronary heart disease, cancer, diabetes and obesity, according to the CDC.
There are multiple strategies for preventing or mitigating adverse childhood experiences. Arwady from the CDC said talking to kids about mental health, monitoring for signs of distress, and supporting emotional development and self-esteem can help. Students can find these resources at home, in school and through community organizations.
Arwady emphasized it's also important to provide support and services to parents and guardians who struggle with mental health and substance abuse.
“This has a generational effect for kids,” Arwady said. “Working early to prevent ACEs and mitigating them if they do occur – that is how we get ahead of these problems as a country.”

2472,real,INSTITUTIONAL_AND_MEDIA_DISTRUST_PUBLIC_INSTITUTIONS,2024-06-10,"""Like a lot of people I was stunned to hear the president decide to do a dissolution (of parliament),"" Hidalgo said of Emmanuel Macron's decision to call snap parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The surprise announcement came after hugely disappointing European parliament election results for the centrist president which Hidalgo said meant the president ""could not continue as before"".
""But all the same, a dissolution just before the Games, it's really something that is extremely unsettling,"" the 64-year-old Socialist, a domestic political rival of the president, added during a visit to a Paris school.
The two-round parliamentary elections have been called for June 30 and July 7, with the Paris Olympics set to begin less than three weeks later on July 26.
The vote could lead to political instability in the event of another hung parliament in which no party wins a majority, or a seismic change if the far-right National Rally party of Marine Le Pen emerges as the biggest party nationally.
Rumours in Paris had previously suggested Macron might dissolve parliament after the Games, with the 46-year-old head of state possibly eyeing a bounce in the polls if the first Games in France in 100 years were deemed a success.
Hidalgo stressed that from an operational perspective the elections would not affect the Olympics, a message echoed by the president of the IOC, Thomas Bach, who was with her during the school visit.
""I think that all the work of installing, of preparing the Games, the infrastructure, is behind us and what remains is to welcome the entire world and we will do it with the joy that we have to host these Olympic and Paralympic Games in Paris,"" Hidalgo said.
Bach said the elections are ""a democratic process which will not disturb the Olympics"".
""France is used to doing elections and they are going to do them once again. We will have a new government and a new parliament and everyone is going to support the Olympics,"" Bach said.
Divided country
The Paris Olympics begin with an unprecedented open-air ceremony on the river Seine on July 26, the first time the opening festivities for a Summer Olympics have taken place outside the main stadium.
Organisers have consistently talked up the ambitions of their vision, promising ""iconic"" Games that will see the world's biggest sports event play out against the historic backdrop of the City of Light.
Worries so far had focused on security arrangements for the opening ceremony, and whether the river Seine would be cleaned up in time to hold the open-water swimming events and triathlon as expected.
Repeated strike threats from trade unions have also cast a shadow over preparations, as did public feuding over the choice of music for the opening ceremony and the official poster -- indicators of France's starkly divided political class.
Those divisions were illustrated during Sunday's European elections, in which anti-immigration and far-right parties won almost 40 percent of the vote, inflicting heavy defeat on Macron's centrist allies.
The snap parliamentary elections raise question marks over the government that will be in place at the time of the Olympics, with ministers such as transport and interior set to play key roles in ensuring the smooth functioning and safety of the event.
The two-stage election will also mobilise hundreds of thousands of security forces, further straining resources.
""For the preparations, the installations are ready, accreditations have been sent, plans put in place for transport: everything is primed, it remains only to be put in place,"" Jean-Loup Chappelet, an Olympics expert at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, told AFP.
He also played down the impact of any personnel changes in the cabinet.
""Nothing will change between now and July 8 in the preparations of the Games and afterwards it will be absolutely too late to change anything,"" he added.
David Roizen, an Olympics expert at the left-leading Jean Jaures Foundation think-tank in Paris, said the political turmoil would put an end to a ""largely successful"" phase for organisers, including the ongoing Olympic torch relay.
""It risks ending the positive dynamic, meaning that people only talk about the Olympics from a security perspective,"" he told AFP.

5715,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-11-13,"""We all heard Mr. Trump say during his campaign that he intended to reach out to Putin himself,"" Peskov told reporters, referring to Trump's campaign pledge to improve relations with Russia. He added that Putin had expressed this willingness during his recent public remarks. (Related: Trump blames Biden, Zelensky for Ukraine conflict, warns of WWIII with Russia.)
Putin's offer of dialogue follows his congratulations to Trump on his election victory, during which he expressed his hope of repairing relations between Moscow and Washington. Relations have soured in recent years, especially due to U.S. support for Ukraine through sanctions on Moscow and near-unlimited military aid for Kyiv. Speaking at a forum in Sochi, Russia, Putin noted that Trump’s desire to ""restore relations with Russia and help end the Ukrainian crisis"" should be taken seriously.
While Putin has signaled his readiness for peace talks, Peskov made it clear that Russia's core demands remain firm.
""Putin has never once said that the goals of the special military operation are changing,"" Peskov said.
Putin's conditions for ending the war include Ukraine forever renouncing its ambitions to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the lifting of Western sanctions against Russia and international recognition that the Crimean Peninsula is Russian territory.
Putin is also demanding that Ukraine cede control over four of its southern territories – the embattled regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which have partially been controlled by pro-Russian separatists since 2014, as well as the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, which Russia was able to mostly occupy since 2022.
""As soon as Kyiv agrees to these conditions and begins the withdrawal of forces, we will instantly order a ceasefire,"" Putin told Russian diplomats in June.
However, Ukraine has rejected these demands, seeing them as an ultimatum that would force capitulation. In response, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky introduced his ""victory plan,"" which includes a path to NATO membership, security guarantees from Western countries and the right to use NATO weapons to strike Russian targets. The Kremlin has warned that such a plan could provoke direct conflict between NATO and Russia.
Trump has promised to end the war quickly if elected, citing his established relationships with both Putin and Zelensky. While he has not laid out specific details, Trump has said he could broker a peace deal that is ""good for both sides."" Trump after the election confirmed that he had already spoken with Zelensky but had not yet reached out to Putin. He indicated that he plans to do so soon.
Zelensky, however, has firmly rejected any compromise with Russia. He warned that any ceasefire talks without strong security guarantees would be ""dangerous"" and could allow Russia to maintain its occupation of Ukrainian territory.
""Such a ceasefire prepares the ground for continued occupation and the destruction of our sovereignty,"" Zelensky stated at a summit in Budapest on Nov. 7.
Putin reiterated his territorial demands during a speech on Nov. 9, insisting that Ukraine withdraw all of their forces from the entirety of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Russia currently occupies parts of these regions but claims the entirety of them as Russian territory. Putin emphasized that a full withdrawal by Ukraine and an official renouncement of NATO membership would trigger an immediate ceasefire and peace negotiations.
However, Ukrainian officials remain skeptical of Putin's intentions. Zelensky has compared Putin's tactics to those of Nazi Germany, specifically referencing Hitler's 1938 demand for Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland.
""You can't trust it,"" Zelensky said, warning that Putin's demands would lead to further aggression.
Ukrainian adviser Mykhailo Podolyak also dismissed Russia's terms as a ""complete sham,"" accusing Putin of trying to avoid paying the price for his aggression while continuing the war in new formats.

6073,fake,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-04-04,"(Article by James Rickards republished from DailyReckoning.com)
Russia is slowly but steadily defeating Ukraine, which is becoming increasingly obvious to everyone except the most anti-Russian diehards.
That’s leading to desperation in elite Western circles determined to stop Russia one way or the other. In their minds, they simply can’t let Putin win. They think that if Putin wins in Ukraine, he’ll next move on to the Baltic states, Poland and elsewhere.
You know the West is getting desperate based on recent threats by France’s Emmanuel Macron to send troops to Ukraine.
The vice president of the Russia Duma, Pyotr Tolstoy (descendant of the great Russian writer Leo Tolstoy), warned that French troops would be priority targets for Russian forces if they entered Ukraine.
Even though France would send troops independent of NATO, that puts us on a very dangerous path that ultimately leads to direct conflict between NATO and Russia. And that path ends in nuclear war ultimately.
Tolstoy added that it would take “just two minutes to nuke Paris.” It’s not hard to envision how quickly things could escalate if France decided to send troops to Ukraine.
Meanwhile, NATO is preparing to send F-16s to Ukraine. Airfields in Ukraine are highly vulnerable to Russian attack, especially since Ukraine’s air defenses are heavily depleted at this point and the Russian air force is becoming increasingly active in Ukraine.
But if NATO allows the F-16s to be based on its own airbases, Putin has warned that these airfields would become a “legitimate target” if strikes against Russian forces were launched from them.
By the way, Russia has hypersonic missiles that NATO has no practical ability to shoot down, so these attacks would likely be successful. Of course, NATO would have to retaliate in kind. You can imagine where all this could lead.
We’re already well along the escalation ladder. And the higher you go, the more face you stand to lose if you back down. I warned about that from the outset of the war.
But the entire notion that Russia poses some existential threat to NATO or Europe is absurd.
First off, the theory that Putin will invade other countries if he wins in Ukraine is nonsense. The Russian army lacks the men and materiel to occupy Ukraine while simultaneously invading other countries.
This isn’t the Soviet Union with its massive tank armies poised to roll over Western Europe. And Soviet communism is long dead, so there’s no ideological basis for Russia to invade Europe. These days Russia is a conservative, Orthodox Christian nation.
But more importantly, Putin has absolutely no incentive to invade any of these nations, which are NATO members. What do they have that he wants?
All it would do is trigger Article 5 of the NATO Charter, which stipulates that an attack on one member is an attack on all, inviting a massive NATO response. At that point, you’re on the fast track to nuclear war.
Putin is fully aware of that.
Fearmongers like to point to what Putin once said in a speech: “Whoever doesn’t miss the Soviet Union doesn’t have a heart.”
They take that as proof that he wants to recreate the Soviet Union. But they conveniently omit what he said next:
“Whoever wants it back doesn’t have a brain.”
Whatever you think of Putin, he definitely has a brain. He has no intention to restore the Soviet Union.
But like any great power, Russia has interests, and Ukraine has always been a vital strategic interest to Russia.
And Russia is not going to tolerate Ukraine joining a NATO alliance that’s hostile to Russia. Critics say Ukraine is a free and independent nation that can join NATO if it wants. Russia has no say in the matter, even though Ukraine borders Russia.
Well, I guess they never heard of the Monroe Doctrine. The U.S. basically declared the entire Western hemisphere its own domain. But a great power like Russia can’t have a say in its own backyard?
Critics also say that the idea of NATO invading Russia is ridiculous. That’s just Russian paranoia. And that’s true, NATO isn’t going to actually invade Russia. But it’s not just intentions that count in the world of geopolitics. It’s also capabilities.
As Bismarck once noted: “What matters in politics is capabilities, not intentions. Intentions change, capabilities remain.”
Given Russia’s long history of being invaded, it’s not hard to imagine why it might seem a bit paranoid of exterior threats.
If you look at a map, parts of Ukraine are actually east of Moscow.

Of course, Ukraine can’t continue fighting without U.S. assistance. The Biden White House wants $60 billion of new money to give to Ukraine to fight the war. This is on top of several hundred billion already provided.
This was proposed last summer but has stalled in the Senate and House of Representatives ever since. The House passed a separate bill to aid Israel last fall, but the Senate refused to take it up because they want to tie that aid to money for Ukraine.
The Senate passed a bill that would provide aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan in one package combined with some money for phony border security.
That bill was so unpopular it could not even make it out of the Senate. Then the House insisted on passing regular appropriations before considering Ukraine.
That process was completed on March 23, but now Congress is on a two-week Easter recess so nothing further will happen until mid-April. No one has even answered the most important question, which is what would Ukraine do with the money.
They can’t buy badly needed 155mm artillery shells because the Western arsenals are bare and factories are not geared to make more than a handful. It will take years to expand that manufacturing capacity.
You can walk into a store with a wallet full of $100 bills, but if the shelves are empty, it doesn’t do you any good. The products simply aren’t there.
Meanwhile, wonder weapons from the West such as tanks, cruise missiles, armored personnel carriers, HIMARS precision-guided artillery and anti-missile batteries have all been destroyed, disabled or shot down by Russia.
The war in Ukraine hasn’t been good advertising for Western weapons.
To repeat what I said earlier, Ukraine is losing the war badly. Russia is advancing on the southern and eastern fronts in Ukraine.
Still, the pressure on House Speaker Mike Johnson to do something remains. The Republican warmongers in the Senate like Lindsey Graham and Joni Ernst won’t let up. Many Republicans in the House such as Chip Roy and Marjorie Taylor Greene are opposed to Johnson on this.
Incredibly, Johnson may respond to the pressure with a solution worse than an outright appropriation. He may get behind efforts to steal $300 billion in Russian central bank assets held in the form of U.S. Treasury securities.
That would destroy confidence in the U.S. dollar, U.S. Treasury securities and the U.S. rule of law. Russia would quickly recover the loss by seizing $300 billion or more of Western assets still in Russia. No one in Congress seems to understand any of this.
If they follow through, the economic fallout would be bad enough. But if this war doesn’t stop soon, we could ultimately be looking at nuclear fallout.

3636,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-07-24,"When the trans sex worker Paola Buenrostro was killed by a client in Mexico City, her friend Kenya Cuevas grabbed the man to stop him fleeing and recorded the scene as police arrived amid sirens, screams and red and blue lights.
Despite the footage and witness testimonies, a judge considered there was insufficient evidence to hold the man and released him after 48 hours, since which time he has been on the run.
That night in 2016 turned Cuevas into an activist. And last week, after years of campaigning, Mexico City passed a law making transfemicide a crime with a prison sentence of up to 70 years – a “watershed” moment in one of Latin America’s deadliest countries for trans people.
“For the first time, we can feel represented before the law, and that violence against us really carries a severe punishment,” said Cuevas at a gathering on Sunday to recognise the victory. “For the first time, I can feel some satisfaction, some peace, after all these long years of work.”
The law, named in honour of Buenrostro, was passed almost unanimously in the state congress.
Mexico City is the second of the country’s 32 states to criminalise transfemicide. Earlier this year, Nayarit, a small state on the Pacific coast, introduced sentences of up to 60 years for the crime.
The law also makes it possible for a victim’s friends, not just relatives, to be involved in the bureaucracy of death and justice: identifying and claiming bodies, and driving the investigations.
This matters in a country where some families disown transgender relatives, meaning there is no one to force the state into action.
In 2022, more than 95% of homicides in Mexico went unpunished. For transfemicides, the figure is thought to be even higher.
In the case of Buenrostro, the initial investigation was negligent, and the suspect was released. Officials later offered more than £20,000 for information as to his whereabouts, to no effect.
Three years later, Ernestina Godoy, the attorney general of Mexico City, apologised for the actions of the authorities, making Buenrostro’s murder the first to be recognised and investigated as transfemicide.
Aranza Villegas, whose sister Viridiana, a trans woman, was murdered two years ago not far from Mexico City, was also at Sunday’s gathering. In that case, the murderer was sent to prison, but Villegas said it was a rare exception.
“I think it’s one in a hundred cases. It took a lot for me and my family to make it happen,” said Villegas. “If a trans woman doesn’t have a family like ours, nothing happens. And so when they die in such a cruel and tragic way, they’re forgotten, and they end up in a mass grave.”
Another way the law seeks to address impunity is by mandating that the attorney general’s office produce statistics and quarterly reports on crimes against people in the LGBTQ+ community, allowing for a more rigorous approach to identifying the patterns of such crimes.
About 5 million of Mexico’s 129 million inhabitants identify as LGBTQ+.
According to Letra Ese, a human rights group, 231 members of the LGBTQ+ community were murdered between 2021 and 2023, of whom two-thirds were transgender – though many murders are never reported.
This makes Mexico Latin America’s second-deadliest country for transgender people, after Brazil.
“Every time you step outside, you are in danger, you fear you won’t come back,” said Villegas. “I live with this fear: I’ve received death threats from people [associated with my sister’s murderer].”
But with the new law, Villegas says, she and other trans people will feel safer in Mexico City.
“It is a watershed moment in stopping these terrible murders, and we hope it extends to every state in Mexico,” said Villegas.
“We just want to be respected as transgender people, like any other human being,” added Villegas. “Respected – that’s all.”"
6050,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-01-24,"Global demand target of 25% divides member states during institutional talks.
A European Parliament target for at least 25% of annual global demand for clean technology to be made in the EU divided member states ambassadors in the final stages of negotiating the Net Zero Industry Act (NZIA) earlier this week, according to an EU diplomat and internal diplomatic note seen by Euronews.
A “global demand” target was introduced to the draft NZIA — the EU’s industrial green plan to deploy at least 40% of domestic production of clean technologies to achieve the bloc’s climate targets by 2030 — by rapporteur MEP Christian Ehler (Germany /European People’s Party)
A number of countries failed to see how such a global demand target “would improve the Union’s access to [clean] technologies”, according to the note, since the goal of the bill is to ensure enough production within the bloc to meet the EU's own demand required as a result of its climate and energy targets, rather than shipping it outside the continent.
“It is important that any goal that might be set is feasible in terms of its implementation, as well as consistent with the legal basis of the regulation,” an EU diplomat told Euronews, confirming that ambassadors broached the issue but failed to reach agreement on it during inter-institutional 'trilogue' negotiations on the NZIA held earlier this week (22 January) .
Another EU diplomat said that there was insufficient underlying data to underpin the parliament's putative 25% target, and it was unclear on what basis the percentage had been reached.
The note said that while Denmark, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, the Netherlands, Sweden, Slovenia and Spain remained open to some form of target being maintained, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czechia, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania were critical of the idea.
MEP Marc Botenga (Belgium/The Left), shadow rapporteur on behalf of the Parliament, noted this is a “theoretical” target and the details on what this threshold means in practice need to be clarified in technical meetings.
“It was presented as necessary to ensure EU's independence with regard to the production of net-zero technologies, now the goal is also to secure a share on the global market,” Botenga said.
MEP Damien Carême (France/Greens), another shadow rapporteur, echoed Botenga’s reservations saying the best way to reinforce the EU’s strategic autonomy and resilience is to focus “on a limited number of sectors of high priority to cover European needs”.
“It should not aim at sizing our manufacturing capacity according to what others intend to deploy on their soil, or to perpetuate an economic model based on unbridled growth at the expense of resources and the environment,” the French lawmaker said.
The Belgian Presidency “remains positive” that a final agreement will be reached during the next inter-institutional negotiation, to be held in Brussels on February 6."

[EPA-EFE/CHRISTOPHE SIMON] Euractiv is part of the Trust Project >>> Languages: Français | DeutschPrint Email Facebook X LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram France will deliver Mirage 2000 fighter jets to Ukraine and train pilots over the next six months, according to President Emmanuel Macron, who made announcements on Thursday. “We will start a new cooperation and announce the delivery of Mirage 2000-5 […], enabling Ukraine to protect its territory and airspace. As of tomorrow, we will start a training programme for [Ukrainian] pilots,” the president said in a TV interview. The first planes should be in operation in “five to six months” to accommodate for training time, Macron said. Training will exclusively take place in France. Macron fell short of saying exactly how many jets would be sent to Ukraine – the exact number should be revealed during a press conference with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky at the Elysée on Friday. These jets, Macron confirmed, could, in turn, be used to target enemy missile launching sites within Russian territory. Last week in Germany, he gave Kyiv the green light to use Western-delivered weaponry to “neutralise […] identified targets” from which missiles are being launched. On Thursday, the president also announced France would train and equip a military “brigade” of 4,500 Ukrainian soldiers on Ukrainian soil: “We’ve done a lot with other European partners on training. We’re now entering a new phase”. After days of hesitation and backroom negotiations, Macron confirmed that military instructors could be sent to the Western part of Ukraine to assemble this brigade, though he ruled out sending the French military on the frontlines. “There is a capacity challenge. We must go faster [in training] tens of thousands of soldiers,” and bringing them to other member states is no longer an option. Sending instructors, on the other hand, could be a viable way forward. “Other member states are on the same line of thought,” he said. “It is an ask from the Ukrainians; it does not amount to an escalation in the conflict, and it is a decision we will take as a coalition [of international partners]. Why should we exclude the idea?” He is the first NATO leader to lay out the idea of training troops on Ukrainian soil so clearly. Finally, the French president ruled out any peace plan between Ukraine and Russia amounting to “Ukrainian capitulation”. Instead, he hoped for “a negotiated peace by both parties, in light with international law, which gives due consideration to the Donbas region and Crimea”. Macron was speaking on the margins of a three-day commemoration for the 80th anniversary of the Allied landing in Normandy alongside several other world leaders, including Joe Biden, Charles III and Zelenskyy. Earlier in the day, US President Biden drew a parallel between the “dark forces” of the Second World War and those threatening Ukraine and the West today. “We will not walk away. If we do, Ukraine will be subjugated, and it will not end there. Ukraine’s neighbours will be threatened, all of Europe will be threatened,” he said. On the war in the Middle East, Macron confirmed he would not recognise the state of Palestine as of now: “The situation is not stable on the ground; it would fail to have put any meaningful pressure on the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority must first undertake reforms”. He said Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu remained a “legitimate interlocutor” despite Israel Defence Forces’ heavy bombing of Rafah in the Southern part of Palestine, drawing condemnation from the international community.

3410,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-10-08,"The end of smallpox was ... the beginning for mpox
It all started with an unremarkable trip to grandma’s house in 1970. But two days into the visit, something went terribly wrong.
The 9-month-old grandson fell ill. First, a fever. Then, a nasty rash. Alarmed doctors suspected smallpox but, instead, they soon discovered something even more bewildering: The first-known human case of monkeypox, now called mpox. The child was patient zero.
Today, more than 50 years after that case in a remote corner of the Democratic Republic of Congo, that same virus is sending public health experts scrambling. So far this year, there have been more than 30,000 suspected mpox cases in 15 African countries — dwarfing previous yearly totals. The surge is prompting some to revisit mpox’s history.
“Monkeypox was detected in 1970 and now it is blowing out of proportion in 2024, what happened along the way?” asked Ugandan health minister Jane Ruth Aceng at a regional World Health Organization meeting in Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo in August.
Looking back, researchers now see that the origins of mpox are inextricably intertwined with the fight against smallpox.
“We vaccinated for smallpox and eradicated it. But look, something came out of that: monkeypox,” said Aceng.
Smallpox and mpox are so closely related that immunity to one helps fight off the other. When smallpox vaccinations were terminated, the world’s immunity to mpox evaporated, and the medical training needed to combat a pox virus started to dissipate too.
This is a story about unintended consequences, and how triumphing over smallpox accidentally created an opening for mpox. Experts say examining the history of mpox carries valuable lessons about how the virus has changed, how our medical toolbox has changed — and what people might do to regain the upper hand over the virus.
How eradicating smallpox paved the way
Doctors don’t know how the grandson contracted mpox on that ill-fated trip to his grandma’s house. And even though his grandma lived about a week’s journey from the DRC’s capital, the boy’s doctors made sure crusts from the little boy’s sores were sent to Moscow for analysis. That’s where the mpox diagnosis was made; the virus has been known since 1958 but had previously only been thought to infect monkeys.
The grandson’s rash attracted global attention because, at that moment in time humanity was closing in on a major accomplishment: The eradication of smallpox, a virus that had killed hundreds of millions in the 20th century alone.
“It's one of humanity's greatest triumphs,” says Dr. William Moss, an epidemiologist and international health expert at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
In order to prove that smallpox was really, truly gone, scientists needed to investigate every rash that looked like smallpox.
Moss says it was only because of this “very intensive surveillance” for smallpox that the boy’s case of mpox was identified. The same was true for the other cases of mpox that soon started to trickle in. By 1978, there were a total of 36 documented monkeypox cases in humans.
At the time, the exact source of the virus stumped scientists: Was it from contact with monkeys? Or perhaps another forest animal? What scientists did know was that mpox is biologically related to smallpox; they’re in the same family of viruses.
Case investigators studying the suspicious rashes quickly realized that those who got mpox had not been vaccinated against smallpox. For example, the 9-month-old was the only one in his family not vaccinated against smallpox and the only one to get monkeypox. He hadn’t been born yet when a mobile smallpox vaccination team rolled through town a year earlier.
Public health experts soon realized that in a world without smallpox infections and vaccinations, nobody would have immunity against mpox. Before stopping smallpox vaccinations, they weighed this risk.
“The overall recommendation was that [smallpox] vaccination was not needed [to protect against mpox],” says Anne Rimoin, a professor of epidemiology at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and a leading mpox researcher.
For one thing, they didn’t see mpox as a big threat. “The potential for human-to-human transmission was low,” says Rimoin. Researchers surmised that mpox came from contact with forest animals “and the overall outlook – in those days – was that with urbanization the chances of exposure to wild animals would be lower,” she says.
In addition, the smallpox vaccine was far from ideal. “People could die from the smallpox vaccine,” says Moss, noting that it contained a live virus and wasn’t suitable for those with weakened immune systems.
In a case report from 1978, the WHO concluded: “Evidence is that this [mpox] rare and sporadic disease is not highly transmissible and does not appear to be a public health problem.”
And so, smallpox vaccinations were stopped. In the DRC, they ended in the early 1980s. And a generation of children vulnerable to mpox came into the world.
The smallpox connection
Fast forward to 2022, and then again to 2024, and the WHO declared mpox a “public health emergency of international concern,” its highest level of alarm.
“No good deed goes unpunished, right?” says Rimoin.
She published a study in PNAS in 2010 documenting how mpox cases have “dramatically increased” as immunity from smallpox has waned. And many experts believe the lack of smallpox immunity is one reason that the majority of cases — and deaths — in the current outbreak are in children who were too young to have smallpox immunity.
Yet, Rimoin thinks the edict to stop smallpox vaccinations was “absolutely” the right choice. “You can put those resources towards other vaccines, other health problems. Cross [smallpox] off your list, move on to something else,” she says.
Others agree. “It was definitely the right decision,” says Dr. Mitch Wolfe, former chief medical officer of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
But, Rimoin acknowledges, the world is now paying the consequences for that decision.
How mpox has changed
In addition to the global loss of immunity, there are three big ways the mpox landscape has shifted since the time mpox was discovered — and largely dismissed.
First, the virus itself has changed.
Just about every piece of the WHO’s 1978 assessment that mpox is a “rare and sporadic disease [that] is not highly transmissible” is no longer true.
Traditionally, a person got mpox after handling infected wild animals, often little rodents. Today, it spreads readily from one person to the next, often through close contact — like, say, sharing linens within a family — or through sexual contact. This means the virus can spread much further and faster than before.
The idea that urbanization would reduce wildlife interactions and therefore squash this virus is now proven preposterous. To the contrary, the DRC’s Ministry of Health has reported more than 500 cases in the capital of Kinshasa. “That is something that worries us very much,” says Dr. Ngashi Ngongo, chief of staff at the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pointing out that Kinshasa is a big and overcrowded city. “That makes it very prone for rapid expansion.”
The second big change? Key medical skills have been lost.
When the smallpox eradication campaign was in full swing, not only were vaccines reaching the most remote corners of the world but staff all over the globe were trained to give the vaccines, detect the rash and collect samples for analysis. Now, those skills have waned.
Barely an mpox discussion goes by without experts lamenting the lack of high-quality data. Remember the 9-month-old’s scabs that were sent from deep in the DRC rainforest to Moscow for testing? That type of maneuver is now proving very challenging.
“Most of the people that collected these specimens have not been trained to understand what is a quality specimen,” says Dr. Jean Kaseya, the director general of Africa CDC. He says specimen collection and correct storage during transportation are proving to be major challenges.
Similarly, vaccination skills have been lost. Many of the mpox vaccines were first developed for smallpox. And most smallpox vaccinations were done with a special needle that scrapes the skin, leaving that famous scar on the upper arm. That’s the same technique used for the Japanese mpox vaccine, which is the only vaccine currently approved for kids in the DRC. One of the hurdles to rolling out that vaccine in the DRC is that it will require a major training effort.
“That's quite a skilled technique, and [teaching that skill] will take time. [It] hasn't been used in vaccination programs for decades now,” says Dr. Mike Ryan, who runs WHO's Health Emergencies Program.
And, a final way things have changed: The world’s appetite for cooperation has shrunk.
The international collaboration that was present during the smallpox eradication campaign is “almost unimaginable right now,” says Moss of Johns Hopkins. It took coordination across war zones and political differences.
While the current mpox outbreak in Africa has garnered major donations from the U.S. to Europe to Japan, many argue that a lack of collaboration is, at least partly, to blame for setting the current outbreak in motion.
“We are talking with our partners, with our colleagues from Western countries, and we are telling them, they are also responsible for the situation that's happening in Africa,” says Africa CDC’s Kaseya.
He says during the 2022 mpox outbreak, the world was only concerned with the strain of mpox circulating in Europe and the U.S. When it came to the strain in Central Africa, “they didn't conduct studies. They didn’t conduct research…Eighty percent of the unknowns [about the current outbreak] are because our colleagues and partners didn't want to see the reality that was going on,” he says.
“We are not blaming them, but we are telling them the truth,” Kaseya says.
Is it time to revive the smallpox vaccine?
A lot has changed since the fateful decision to stop vaccinating for smallpox — and by extension mpox. Rick Bright believes it is a good time to reconsider that decision.
Bright, who used to lead the U.S. Center for the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, says he’d like to see a discussion about whether to “begin, once again, vaccinating the population, the global population, with the vaccine to make sure that we are all protected from mpox and smallpox and other derivatives that we might see.”
Bright points out that, in the intervening decades, the smallpox and mpox vaccines have become a lot safer. And the mpox virus has certainly proven its ability to evolve and spread widely.
However, he’s quick to admit, any mass vaccination effort would not happen immediately. Right now, there aren’t enough mpox vaccine doses to address the current mpox outbreak, let alone add it to the routine vaccination list.
Moss, of Johns Hopkins, isn't so sure mass vaccination is the way to go since mpox has not spread widely in the general population. ""I still see it as more targeted, whether it's a high risk population or spatially,"" he says. That's the approach the DRC has taken, focusing on hotspots as well as populations that are most at risk, like children, health care workers and sex workers.
What they agree on is that there needs to significantly more vaccine production and availability — and a broader discussion about what protection from pox viruses is needed."

As the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body meets to negotiate the text of the Pandemic Treaty,* more than 100 high-profile people have signed an open letter to leaders of WHO member states calling for an urgent agreement on a pandemic accord.
“An agreement is meant to be reached just two and a half months from now – countries imposed a deadline of May 2024, in time for the 77th World Health Assembly,” the letter states. And continues:
“As countries now enter what should be the final stages of the negotiations, they must ensure that they are agreeing on actions which will do the job required: to prevent and mitigate pandemic threats.
“We urge solutions which ensure both speed in reporting and sharing pathogens, and in access – in every country – to sufficient tools like tests and vaccines to protect lives and minimise harm.”
In total, 107 people signed the letter. Signatories include 16 Club de Madrid members, 9 Global Leadership Foundation members, 46 Nizami Ganjavi International Centre members and a variety of academics and former politicians, including the former UK prime ministers Gordon Brown and Tony Blair.

WHO’s Actions are Unlawful
The World Health Organisation’s (“WHO’s”) Pandemic Accord is also referred to as the Pandemic Treaty, Pandemic Agreement and WHO Convention Agreement + (“WHO CA+”).
In December 2021, WHO established the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body to draft and negotiate a pandemic agreement. The INB is having its ninth meeting from 18 March to 28 March to negotiate the Pandemic Treaty’s text in the hopes it will be approved at the upcoming World Health Assembly.*
From 27 May to 1 June 2024, WHO is due to convene its 77th World Health Assembly (WHA”). The WHA is WHO’s main decision-making body. The proposed amendments to the International Health Regulations (“IHR”) amendments and the text of the Pandemic Treaty will be presented to the 77th WHA. WHO and its backers will be hoping that both the Treaty text and the IHR will be adopted.
In 2023, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health highlighted the two issues that dominated discussions during the 76th WHA: new ways to fund the “cash-strapped” WHO and the rewriting process for the pandemic response playbook.
The rewriting of the rules that will lead to the establishment of a pandemic accord will dominate discussions again this year. The pandemic accord negotiations coincide with negotiations on IHR amendments. These 2-track negotiations often involve the same diplomats. Johns Hopkins described the difference, in their view, between the two proposed instruments:
The IHR are mostly seen as technical rules for disease surveillance, and negotiations are underway about making targeted amendments that could expand the IHR’s scope to also include equity considerations and other issues. The pandemic accord, on the other hand, is seen as a broader instrument that could also consider a host of other issues including intellectual property and One Health issues, for example.The 2023 World Health Assembly: A New Playbook for Health Emergencies? Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 18 May 2023
Five months after its 76th WHA, on 7 October 2023, WHO released a statement in which it declared it would not share the finalised IHR amendments with the public and WHO member states four months before the vote on it in May 2024 as WHO’s own rules require. Dr. Silvia Behrendt pointed out that this is unlawful.
What is the Club de Madrid?
Club de Madrid is the world’s largest forum of former heads of state and government and is composed of 126 members from 73 countries, including 7 Nobel Peace Prize laureates, 14 leaders of regional and international organisations and 6 former UN special envoys on climate change. You can view a list of members HERE.
Since October 2019, Danilo Türk has been Club de Madrid’s president. Türk was the President of Slovenia from 2007 until 2012. Before becoming Slovenia’s president, he was Permanent Representative to the UN in New York and represented Slovenia on the UN Security Council and served as UN Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs. In 2016, he was one of the candidates for the post of the Secretary-General of the UN. In 2022, Türk was named one of the 12 people who are part of the UN Secretary-General’s High-Level Advisory Board on Effective Multilateralism Comprises, which will be asked to build on the ideas in ‘Our Common Agenda’.
As Jacob Nordangård pointed out, “Our Common Agenda and the Pact for the Future can be seen as the United Nations’ answer to the call for a Great Reset that was announced in June 2020 by Klaus Schwab, António Guterres and Prince Charles (now King Charles III).”
What is the Global Leadership Foundation?
The Global Leadership Foundation (“GLF”) is a not-for-profit foundation, registered in Switzerland and founded in 2004 by FW de Klerk, former president of the Republic of South Africa.
GLF “exists to make available, discreetly and in confidence, the experience of former leaders to today’s national leaders,” its website states. It does this through its network of members – former presidents, prime ministers, senior government ministers and other leaders. “Working in small teams, in their personal capacity, [GLF] members offer private and confidential advice to heads of government,” GLF says. You can view a list of GLF members HERE.
GLF’s supporters are called the International Council, a group of companies, people and foundations, invited by GLF’s chair. “The level of involvement of the International Council is at their discretion,” GLF declares. It implies that “support” is advisory. It doesn’t explicitly state whether “support” also involves monetary support. Although on another page of its website, GLF does state that their “costs are met through donations from private individuals, corporations and other foundations” and “donors are invited to join GLF’s International Council.”
You can see a full list of GLF’s supporters HERE. The newest members of the International Council are:
- Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
- Sir Ronald Cohen
- The Hunter Foundation
- Oren Taylor
- Sanofi
Since October 2021, Helen Clark has been the chair of the Global Leadership Foundation. Clark was the prime minister of New Zealand between 1999 and 2008. From 2009 to 2017 she was the United Nations Development Programme (“UNDP”) Administrator. She was also the Chair of the United Nations Development Group. In 2019, Clark became patron of The Helen Clark Foundation. GLF describes her as “a global leader in sustainable development and gender equality.”
What is the Nizami Ganjavi International Centre?
The involvement of Nizami Ganjavi International Centre (“NGIC”) members signing the open letter to leaders of WHO member states is where things become curious, if not bizarre.
Established in 2012, NGIC claims to be a cultural, non-political organisation dedicated to the memory of the 12th century Muslim poet Neẓāmī Ganjavi and the study and dissemination of his works.
Among its partners, NGIC boasts the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, the UN, the World Trade Organisation and the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (“UNAIDS”) which is “leading the global effort to end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030 as part of the Sustainable Development Goals.” To this aim, UNAIDS brings together the efforts and resources of 11 UN system organisations.
NGIC co-chairs are psychologist Vaira Vike-Freiberga, former president of Latvia, and Ismail Serageldin, former vice president of the World Bank.
Vaira Vike-Freiberga is a former president of the Club de Madrid (1999-2007). While president of Latvia she was instrumental in achieving Latvia’s membership in the European Union (“EU”) and NATO, and was Special Envoy on UN reform. In addition to NGIC, she is a member, board member or patron of 29 international organisations, including the World Leadership Alliance and the European Council on Foreign Relations, as well as five academies. She was an official candidate for the post of UN Secretary-General in 2006.
Since the end of her presidency in Latvia in 2007, Vike-Freiberga has been vice chair of the Reflection group on the long-term future of Europe, chaired the high-level group on freedom and pluralism of the media in the EU and was a member of two high-level groups on European security and defence.
Ismail Serageldin is a founding Director of the Bibliotheca Alexandrina. He has held many international positions including as vice president of the World Bank, co-chair of the African Union’s high-level group for biotechnology and again for science, technology and innovation, and was a member of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (“ICANN”) panel for the review of the internet future.
Open Letter to WHO Member States
Gordon Brown published the letter on his website. Brown, a former prime minister of the United Kingdom, is the United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education and, since September 2021, has also been serving as WHO Ambassador for Global Health Financing.
According to his website, one of Brown’s campaigns is globalisation. His globalisation campaign webpage states: “Globalisation … has been and is one of the defining themes of Gordon’s life in politics … Globalisation triggered a decades-long transition to a predominantly knowledge and financial services economy, in which the pace of change constantly accelerates.”
The following is the open letter signed by 107 signatories. We have included the list of signatories at the end as, sometime in the future, it’ll be useful to know who urged for global tyranny to take hold under the pretext of pandemic preparedness.
Joint letter to leaders of WHO member states calling for an urgent agreement on a pandemic accord
20 March, 2024
To Leaders of WHO Member States,
The overwhelming lesson we learned from covid-19 is that no one is safe anywhere until everyone is safe everywhere – and that can only happen through collaboration. In response, the 194 countries which are members of the World Health Organisation decided in December 2021 to launch negotiations for a new international instrument on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, a Pandemic Accord, as a “global framework” to work together to prepare for and stem any new pandemic threat, including by achieving equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.
Negotiation of an effective pandemic accord is a much needed opportunity to safeguard the world we live in. Countries themselves have proposed this instrument, individual countries are negotiating it, and only countries will ultimately be responsible for its requirements and its success or failure.
Establishing a strong global pact on pandemics will protect future generations from a repeat of the millions of deaths and the social and economic devastation which resulted from a lack of collaboration during the covid-19 pandemic. All countries need what the accord can offer: the capacity to detect and share pathogens presenting a risk, and timely access to tests, treatments and vaccines.
An agreement is meant to be reached just two and a half months from now – countries imposed a deadline of May 2024, in time for the 77th World Health Assembly.
As countries now enter what should be the final stages of the negotiations, they must ensure that they are agreeing on actions which will do the job required: to prevent and mitigate pandemic threats. We urge solutions which ensure both speed in reporting and sharing pathogens, and in access – in every country – to sufficient tools like tests and vaccines to protect lives and minimise harm. The public and private sectors must work together towards the public good. This global effort is being threatened by misinformation and disinformation. Among the falsehoods circulating are allegations that the WHO intends to monitor people’s movements through digital passports; that it will take away the national sovereignty of countries; and that it will have the ability to deploy armed troops to enforce mandatory vaccinations and lockdowns. All of these claims are wholly false and governments must work to disavow them with clear facts.
It is imperative now to build an effective, multisectoral and multilateral approach to pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response marked by a spirit of openness and inclusiveness. In doing so we can send a message that even in this fractured and fragmented world, cross-border co-operation can deliver global solutions to global problems.
We call on leaders of all countries to step up their efforts and secure an effective pandemic accord by May. A new pandemic threat will emerge – and there is no excuse not to be ready for it.

2409,real,INSTITUTIONAL_AND_MEDIA_DISTRUST_PUBLIC_INSTITUTIONS,2024-01-31,"Grave peril of digital conspiracy theories: ‘What happens when no one believes anything anymore?’
Conspiracy theories are older than the republic. But experts say it would be wrong to dismiss believers as simply stupid or deranged. (Jan. 31)(AP video: Allen Breed, Eugene Garcia, Daniel Kozin)
WASHINGTON (AP) — Days after Maui’s wildfires killed scores of people and destroyed thousands of homes last August, a shocking claim spread with alarming speed on YouTube and TikTok: The blaze on the Hawaiian island was set deliberately, using futuristic energy weapons developed by the U.S. military.
Claims of “evidence” soon emerged: video footage on TikTok showing a beam of blinding white light, too straight to be lightning, zapping a residential neighborhood and sending flames and smoke into the sky. The video was shared many millions of times, amplified by neo-Nazis, anti-government radicals and supporters of the QAnon conspiracy theory, and presented as proof that America’s leaders had turned on the country’s citizens.
“What if Maui was just a practice run?” one woman asked on TikTok. “So that the government can use a direct energy weapon on us?”
The TikTok clip had nothing to do with the Maui fires. It was actually video of an electrical transformer explosion in Chile earlier in the year. But that didn’t stop a TikTok user with a habit of posting conspiracy videos from using the clip to sow more fear and doubt. It was just one of several similar videos and images doctored and passed off as proof that the wildfires were no accident.
Conspiracy theories have a long history in America, but now they can be fanned around the globe in seconds, amplified by social media, further eroding truth with a newfound destructive force.
With the United States and many other nations facing big elections in 2024, , the perils of rapidly spreading disinformation, using ever more sophisticated technology such as artificial intelligence, now also threaten democracy itself — both by fueling extremist groups and by encouraging distrust.
“I think the post-truth world may be a lot closer than we’d like to believe,” said A.J. Nash, vice president for intelligence at ZeroFox, a cybersecurity firm that tracks disinformation. “What happens when no one believes anything anymore?”
Extremists and authoritarians deploy disinformation as potent weapons used to recruit new followers and expand their reach, using fake video and photos to fool their followers.
And even when they fail to convince people, the conspiracy theories embraced by these groups contribute to mounting distrust of authorities and democratic institutions, causing people to reject reliable sources of information while encouraging division and suspicion.
Melissa Sell, a 33-year-old Pennsylvania resident, is among those who has lost faith in the facts.
“If it’s a big news story on the TV, the majority of the time it’s to distract us from something else. Every time you turn around, there’s another news story with another agenda distracting all of us,” she said. Sell thinks the Maui wildfires may have been intentionally set, perhaps to distract the public, perhaps to test a new weapon. “Because the government has been caught in lies before, how do you know?” she said.
Absent meaningful federal regulations governing social media platforms, it’s largely left to Big Tech companies to police their own sites, leading to confusing, inconsistent rules and enforcement. Meta, the owner of Instagram and Facebook, says it makes an effort to remove extremist content. Platforms such as X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Telegram and far-right sites like Gab, allow it to flourish.
Federal election officials and some lawmakers have suggested regulations governing AI, including rules that would require political campaigns to label AI-generated images used in its ads. But those proposals wouldn’t affect the ability of extremist groups or foreign governments to use AI to mislead Americans.
The role of conspiracy theories in American politics and society
Conspiracy theories, which have a long history in the U.S., are influencing our politics, our culture and even our health care. There are psychological reasons why anyone could believe in these theories — and ways people can escape.
This series explores the high stakes for individuals and society.
- History: Even before the revolution, America was a nation of conspiracy theorists
- The grave peril: ‘What happens when no one believes anything anymore?’
- Miracle cures: Online conspiracy theories are creating a new age of unproven medical treatments
- Conspiracy theories: Why we want to believe when the facts often aren’t there
- Days of darkness: How one woman escaped the conspiracy theory trap that has ensnared millions
Meanwhile, U.S.-based tech platforms have rolled back their efforts to root out misinformation and hate speech, following the lead of Elon Musk, who fired most of the content moderators when he purchased X.
“There’s been a big step backward,” said Evan Hansen, the former editor of Wired.com who was Twitter’s director of curation before leaving when Musk purchased the platform. “It’s gotten to be a very difficult job for the casual observer to figure out: What do I believe here?”
Hansen said a combination of government regulations, voluntary action by tech titans and public awareness will be needed to combat the coming wave of synthetic media. He noted the Israel-Hamas war has already seen a deluge of fake and altered photos and video. Elections in the U.S. and around the world this year will create similar opportunities for digital mischief.
The disinformation spread by extremist groups and even politicians like former President Donald Trump can create the conditions for violence, by demonizing the other side, targeting democratic institutions and convincing their supporters that they’re in an existential struggle against those who don’t share their beliefs.
Trump has spread lies about elections, voting and his opponents for years. Building on his specious claims of a deep state that controls the federal government, he has echoed QAnon and other conspiracy theories and encouraged his followers to see their government as an enemy. He even suggested that now-retired Army Gen. Mark Milley, whom Trump himself nominated to be the top U.S. military officer during his administration, was a traitor and deserved execution. Milley said he has had to take security precautions to protect his family.
The list of incidents blamed on extremists motivated by conspiracy theories is growing. The Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, attacks on vaccine clinics, anti-immigrant fervor in Spain; and anti-Muslim hate in India: All were carried out by people who believed conspiracy theories about their opponents and who decided violence was an appropriate response.
Polls and research surveys on conspiracy theories show about half of Americans believe in at least one conspiracy theory, and those views seldom lead to violence or extremism. But for some, these beliefs can lead to social isolation and radicalization, interfering with their relationships, career and finances. For an even smaller subset, they can lead to violence.
The credible data that exists on crimes motivated by conspiracy theories shows a disturbing increase. In 2019, researchers at the University of Maryland’s National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism identified six violent attacks in which perpetrators said their actions were prompted by a conspiracy theory. In 2020, the year of the most recent survey, there were 116.
Laws designed to rein in the power of social media and artificial intelligence to spread disinformation aren’t likely to pass before the 2024 election, and even if they are, enforcement will be a challenge, according to AI expert Vince Lynch, CEO of the tech company IV.AI.
“This is happening now, and it’s one of the reasons why our society seems so fragmented,” Lynch said. “Hopefully there may be AI regulation someday, but we are already through the looking glass. I do think it’s already too late.”
To believers, the facts don’t matter.
“You can create the universe you want,” said Danielle Citron, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law who studies online harassment and extremism. “If the truth doesn’t matter, and there is no accountability for these false beliefs, then people will start to act on them.”
Sell, the conspiracy theorist from Pennsylvania, said she began to lose trust in the government and the media shortly after the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, that left 20 students and six educators dead. Sell thought the shooter looked too small and weak to carry out such a bloody act, and the gut-wrenching interviews with stricken loved ones seemed too perfect, almost practiced.
“It seemed scripted,” she said. “The pieces did not fit.”
That idea — that the victims of the rampage were actors hired as part of a plot to push gun control laws — was notably spread by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. The families of Sandy Hook victims sued, and the Infowars host was later ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in damages.
Claims that America’s elected leaders and media cannot be trusted feature heavily in many conspiracy theories with ties to extremism.
In 2018, a committed conspiracy theorist from Florida mailed pipe bombs to CNN, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and several other top Democrats; the man’s social media feed was littered with posts about child sacrifice and chemtrails — the debunked claim that airplane vapor clouds contain chemicals or biological agents being used to control the population.
In another act of violence tied to QAnon, a California man was charged with using a speargun to kill his two children in 2021. He told an FBI agent that he had been enlightened by QAnon conspiracy theories and had become convinced that his wife “possessed serpent DNA and had passed it on to his children.”
In 2022, a Colorado woman was found guilty of attempting to kidnap her son from foster care after her daughter said she began associating with QAnon supporters. Other adherents have been accused of environmental vandalism, firing paintballs at military reservists, abducting a child in France and even killing a New York City mob boss.
The coronavirus pandemic, with its attendant social isolation, created ideal conditions for new conspiracy theories as the virus spread fear and uncertainty around the globe. Vaccine clinics were attacked, doctors and nurses threatened. 5G communication towers were vandalized and burned as a wild theory spread claiming they were being used to activate microchips hidden in the vaccine. Fears about vaccines led one Wisconsin pharmacist to destroy a batch of the highly sought after immunizations, while bogus claims about supposed COVID-19 treatments and cures led to hospitalizations and death.
Few recent events, however, display the power of conspiracy theories like the Jan. 6 insurrection, when thousands of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, vandalized the offices of Congress and fought with police in an attempt to disrupt the certification of the 2020 election.
More than 1,200 people have been charged with Capitol riot-related crimes. About 900 have pleaded guilty or been convicted after trials. Over 750 have been sentenced, with roughly two-thirds receiving some term of imprisonment, according to data compiled by The Associated Press. Many of those charged said they had bought into Trump’s conspiracy theories about a stolen election.
“We, meaning Trump supporters, were lied to,” wrote Jan. 6 defendant Robert Palmer in a letter to a judge, who later sentenced him to more than five years for attacking police. “They kept spitting out the false narrative about a stolen election and how it was ‘our duty’ to stand up to tyranny.”
Many conspiracy theorists reject any link between their beliefs and violence, saying they’re being blamed for the actions of a tiny few. Others insist these incidents never occurred, and that events like the Jan. 6 attack were actually false-flag events concocted by the government and media.
“Lies, lies lies: They’re lying to you over and over and over again,” said Steve Girard, a Pennsylvania man who has protested the incarceration of Jan. 6 defendants. He spoke to the AP while waving a large American flag on a busy street in Washington.
While they may have taken on a bigger role in our politics, surveys show that belief in conspiracy theories hasn’t changed much over the years, according to Joe Uscinski, a University of Miami professor and an expert on the history of conspiracy theories. He said he believes that while the internet plays a role in spreading conspiracy theories, most of the blame lies with the politicians who exploit believers.
“Who was the bigger spreader of COVID misinformation: some guy with four followers on Twitter or the president of the United States? The problem is our politicians,” Uscinski said. “Jan. 6 happened, and people said: ‘Oh, this is Facebook’s fault.’ No, the president of the United States told his followers to be at this place, at this time and to fight like hell.”
Governments in Russia, China, Iran and elsewhere have also pushed extremist content on social media as part of their efforts to destabilize Western democracy. Russia has amplified numerous anti-U.S. conspiracy theories, including ones claiming the U.S. runs secret germ warfare labs and created HIV as a bioweapon, as well as conspiracy theories accusing Ukraine of being a Nazi state.
China has helped spread claims that the U.S. created COVID-19 as a bioweapon.
Tom Fishman, the CEO at the nonprofit Starts With Us, said that Americans can take steps to defend the social fabric by turning off their computer and meeting the people they disagree with. He said Americans must remember what ties them together.
“We can look at the window and see foreshadowing of what could happen if we don’t: threats to a functioning democracy, threats of violence against elected leaders,” he said. “We have a civic duty to get this right.”"
3036,fake,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-08-23,"(LifeSiteNews) — Wildfires are, at least seemingly, becoming not only more and more frequent but also alarmingly catastrophic. While there are some experts who say that, at least on a global scale, it is merely media coverage of fires that has increased and not the actual area of fire destruction, the apparent frequency in the western part of the United States has led to a joke that there is a now new season known as fire season.
We know from science as well as history that there are cycles in the weather that explain hot summers and low snow packs which attribute to “fire season.” This climate cycle is being exploited and used to scare the public into accepting control over many aspects of their lives that, if not stopped, will culminate in forced “climate change” lockdowns.
Wildfires are intentionally being mismanaged at the highest levels and those whose lives are being put the most at risk are the brave people who are on the ground and in the air fighting these fires. This mismanagement has also caused huge financial losses suffered by homeowners and ranchers not to mention entire communities as insurance premiums become unaffordable. For the last decade funding has been decreased, the number of fire fighters has been reduced, and incompetent people have been paced in leadership positions.
It is a well known fact that forests are being mismanaged by not removing underbrush. During the Camp Fire in Paradise, CA, 85 people died. PG&E, the power company whose power lines sparked the fire, pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and unlawfully starting a fire. Environmentalists blamed infrastructure problems with PG&E, underplaying and even criticizing PG&E’s practice of tree removal, saying it was not underbrush to blame but PG&E’s outdated infrastructure. Many citizens however complained that PG&E had misused funds and instead of clearing under the power lines left the land susceptible to wildfire. In Maui, there were headlines that read that the evacuation sirens and the emergency broadcast were not employed to warn residents. The media was silent about the mismanagement of this Lahaina wildfire that claimed over 100 lives.
One may wonder what is going on. The most suspicious of us would guess that it is desired that people die, a small price to pay to move forward with a globalist, depopulation agenda. Some fires have been started by arsonists, as was the case with a western Washington fire, which begs the question: are fires being lit intentionally? Some fires seem to be allowed to burn and others are stamped out with a vengeance. This also makes one question if there is a conspiracy afoot.
I know from personal experience that when a wildfire comes through and homeowners are evacuated no one is going to defend their homes. In a 2017 Idaho wildfire, neighbors and friends were asked by the fire department to leave, but instead many stayed, built fire barriers with Pulaski axes and hand shovels, and defended one another’s homes with garden hoses.
Where I live farmers scoff at evacuation orders, opting to plow a fire break for their own fields with their own equipment. I also know a smoke jumper who diligently and aggressively creates a defensible space around his home because he doesn’t trust the fire department to put out a fire. Let it be known that if you evacuate, your home will likely burn.
I don’t know the ins and outs of how departments and bases work together, but I do know that fire season is being exploited. It is being exploited in the same way law enforcement agencies like the Secret Service are being exploited. They are being exploited in an effort to take away the American people’s freedom and independence.
The entire effort to fight wildfires has been sabotaged. First, funding has been removed and bases have been consolidated. Second, the workforce has been depleted and strategic decision-making has been compromised. Both these misfortunes have been caused by incompetent people being put into leadership positions. Fighting fires is a demanding job and if crews are met with frustration and bad “company culture” the men that make up these crews are going to seek employment elsewhere. Fire crews must have confidence in leadership and experience camaraderie otherwise men will not be attracted to this line of work. Confidence and camaraderie suffer when leadership is incompetent.
Destructive, out of control fires occurring summer after summer are imperative in getting ordinary Americans to believe that “climate change” is a major threat to their way of life. In order to enforce COVID lockdowns, mask mandates, and effectively forced vaccinations, the American people had to be scared into compliance. The only way that globalists will be able to control Americans and regulate the way we view marriage, enjoy our meals, enjoy freedom of movement and ultimately use electricity, is by scaring us into forced lockdowns and other methods of control. When we enter this conversation about wildfires, remember it is not just hot summers and low snow packs that are to blame. The lion’s share of the blame rests on the shoulders of elites who have put incompetent people into leadership roles, have removed funding to fight fires adequately and have hindered proper forest management."

Acreage burned this year in U.S. wildfires is up 278% from 2023.
It's only August, but already the U.S. wildfire season has burned more than 4.4 million acres, up a staggering 278% from last year, the National Interagency Fire Center reported Thursday.
Fueled by record high temperatures, including prolonged heat waves that have left many parts of the West with bone-dry vegetation, firefighters were battling 93 large active wildfires on Thursday in 13 states, including 28 fires that have prompted evacuations, according to the fire center.
With precipitation in the West below normal for July, some of the largest fires in U.S. history have ignited, especially in California and Oregon where a combined 44 fires were burning on Thursday, according to the fire center.
""Warming temperatures, drier conditions, and shifts in precipitation are contributing to an increase in the frequency of large wildfires and acres of land burned in the U.S. each year,"" according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
A prime example is the Park Fire in Northern California, which officials said was deliberately set on July 24 and rapidly spread through dry vegetation to become the largest active fire in the nation and as of Friday was the fourth-largest wildland blaze in California history.
""Year-to-date annual acres burned for the U.S. is above the 10-year average at 123% of normal,"" according to a statement from the National Interagency Fire Center.
The fire center added, ""In comparison to the outlook issued a month ago, larger areas of the West are expected to experience above normal significant fire potential in August and September.""
And just because most of the wildfire activity is happening in the West, that doesn't mean the rest of the country is immune from the effects.
""Western wildfires account for about half of the smoke that the rest of the contiguous U.S. experiences each year,"" according to Climate Central, an independent group of scientists that researches climate change.
The average number of heat waves major U.S. cities experience each year has doubled since the 1980s, according to the federal government’s Fifth National Climate Assessment. In the United States, summer minimum nighttime temperatures are warming nearly twice as fast as summer maximum daytime temperatures, according to Climate Central.
No state has experienced a worse wildfire season than California. The number of acres consumed by flames in the Golden State as of Thursday is 768,137, an increase of 2,905% from 2023, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire). The 4,696 wildfires that have erupted in the state this year have destroyed more than 700 structures, including homes and commercial property, according to Cal Fire.
Here are some of the largest fires burning in the West:
The Park Fire in California
Firefighters battling the Park Fire in Northern California, the largest active fire in the nation, made significant progress in the past three days, increasing containment lines on the blaze to 24% as of Friday, according to Cal Fire.
The Park Fire, which officials said was deliberately started on July 24 and spread through Butte, Plumas, Shasta and Tehama counties in Northern California, has grown to 397,629 acres. The blaze leapfrogged Thursday over the 2020 SCU Lighting Complex Fire -- which tore through Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa, San Joaquin, Merced, and Stanislaus counties -- to become the fourth-largest wildfire in state history, officials said.
The Park Fire has destroyed at least 540 structures and damaged another 50, according to Cal Fire. No fatalities or injuries have been reported.
More than 3,800 people have been evacuated due to the Park Fire, Cal Fire said.
Ronnie Dean Stout II, 42, of Chico, has been accused of starting the blaze and was arrested on a charge of felony arson with an enhancement of special circumstances. On Thursday, Stout made his second court appearance this week. His arraignment was continued to a later date to allow his public defender to review the case reports and determine a plea, according to ABC affiliate station KRCR in Redding, California.
Stout, who remains in jail without bail, was allegedly spotted just before 3 p.m. PT on July 24 pushing a burning car down a gully called ""Alligator Hole"" in Bidwell Park, near Chico, sparking the Park Fire, prosecutors said.
The Nixon Fire in Southern California
California firefighters were also confronting the Nixon Fire that Monday off Richard Nixon Boulevard in Riverside County, northeast of the town of Aguanga, according to Cal Fire.
As of Friday, the Nixon Fire had grown to 5,222 acres and was 21% contained, according to Cal Fire.
At least four structures in the fire zone were destroyed, according to Cal Fire.
The Alexander Mountain Fire in Colorado
Colorado firefighters were also trying to get the upper hand on the Alexander Mountain Fire, which was first reported Monday morning, according to the Larimer County Sheriff's Office. The fire burning in a remote mountainous area near Roosevelt National Park grew to 9,053 acres by Friday morning, according to the U.S. Forest Service.
The fire was 5% contained, according to the Forest Service.
Stone Canyon Fire in Colorado
The Stone Canyon Fire, west of Rabbit Mountain and the town of Lyons, had burned 1,553 acres as of Thursday night, according to the Boulder Office of Disaster Management.
The blaze was 30% contained, officials said.
The remains of a person were recovered from a home in the area of the Stone Canyon Fire on Wednesday, according to Boulder County Sheriff Curtis Johnson. But Johnson released few details on the circumstances of the death.
Quarry Fire in Colorado
The Quarry Fire, burning southwest of Denver in Jefferson County, is being investigated as arson after fire investigators found suspicious evidence on Thursday, the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office told ABC News.
""We preliminarily believe that this fire is human-caused in some manner,"" Kevin Bost, chief of investigations with the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office, said during a press briefing Friday morning.
No additional details were released amid the investigation.
The wildfire has burned more than 450 acres since originating on Deer Creek Tuesday night, prompting evacuations, authorities said."

The vaccines target the KP.2 strain, an offshoot of the omicron variant.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved and granted emergency use authorization Thursday for updated COVID-19 vaccines for the upcoming fall and winter season.
The FDA said the vaccines will target the KP.2 strain, which is an offshoot of the omicron variant.
The federal health agency said the decision applies to the vaccines manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. No decision has been made on the vaccines from Novavax.
""Vaccination continues to be the cornerstone of COVID-19 prevention,"" said Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in a statement. ""These updated vaccines meet the agency's rigorous, scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality.""
""Given waning immunity of the population from previous exposure to the virus and from prior vaccination, we strongly encourage those who are eligible to consider receiving an updated COVID-19 vaccine to provide better protection against currently circulating variant,"" the statement continued.
The CDC previously recommended that everyone ages 6 months and older receive an updated vaccine. The updated vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna will be available for those 6 months old and older
Vaccine manufacturers told ABC News the vaccines are expected to be available in the coming week.
Winter months tend to see an increase of respiratory illness spread, including COVID, flu and RSV. COVID, particularly, typically spikes in the winter and summer months.
""These updated COVID-19 vaccines come at a crucial time as we head into the fall and winter months, when respiratory viruses tend to surge,"" said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist and chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hosptial and an ABC News contributor. ""By targeting the most currently circulating variants, these vaccines offer us a better chance at reducing severe illness and keeping communities safe.""
The CDC has said that it is safe to receive a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time as a flu shot or an RSV vaccine, for those who are being eligible.
Anyone who has recently had COVID, may want to consider delaying getting vaccinated by three months, according to the CDC.
Those who are covered by Medicare, Medicaid or private insurance will receive coverage for the updated vaccines.
In previous years, the CDC had a Bridge Access Program that provided free COVID-19 vaccines to adults without health insurance and adults whose insurance does not cover all COVID-19 vaccine costs. The program is ending in August 2024. It remains unclear what might be available to provide access to this population.
Unvaccinated children from ages 6 months through 4 years are eligible to receive three doses of the Pfizer vaccine or two doses of the Moderna vaccine. Children in this age group who are vaccinated are eligible to receive one or two doses of either vaccine.
Those who are 5 and older, regardless of vaccination status, are eligible to receive a single dose of the updated vaccine. If they have been previously vaccinated, it should be at least two months after the last dose.
The FDA said additional doses are authorized for certain immunocompromised individuals aged 6 months through 11 years.
""It's important for everyone aged six months and older to consider getting this updated shot. We know that that immunity wanes over time, and staying up to date with vaccinations is the best way to maintain strong protection against COVID-19, especially with new variants emerging,"" Brownstein said.

3699,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-09-12,"Europe is suffering from a healthcare crisis, with chronic staff shortages, low pay and overtime prompting strikes in Germany, Slovenia, and Sweden. In France meanwhile, a controversial medicine education reform has students and doctors up in arms.
Hospitals across Europe appear to be on life support.
Whether it's in France, Slovenia or Sweden, hospitals are facing staff shortages, lower wages and increasing levels of overtime, prompting industrial action across the healthcare sector which inevitably impacts patient care.
In Sweden, healthcare workers went on strike for the first time in 16 years to protest against their working hours and low pay over 78 consecutive days in 2024.
It's less common to see strikes in the Nordic countries than in other parts of Europe, yet after four months of collective bargaining negotiations, the Swedish Association of Health Professionals' hand was forced, and it went on strike from 11 April to 28 June.
""We met a dead end in the negotiations,"" said Sineva Ribeiro, president of the Swedish Association of Health Professionals, a trade union with a membership of 114,000 representing nurses, midwives, biomedical scientists and radiographers. ""We had to go on strike. We had to have a conflict.”
The trade union also issued an overtime ban. ""In 2023, they [members of the association] did three million overtime hours,"" Ribeiro said. ""So we knew that there was a lack of nurses, midwives, radiographs and X-ray nurses.""
In the end, the Swedish Association of Health Professionals managed to obtain reduced working hours for 10% of its members — those who work night shifts — a 3.05% salary increase and an agreement that employers pay for nurse specialisations.
On the flipside, they agreed to abandon calls to reduce medical staff's weekly working hours from 40 to 37.
More generally, deteriorating working conditions are said to be one of the main factors forcing health workers out of Sweden and into neighbouring countries.
""We have about 20,000 nurses working in Norway because they pay more and they have less hours a week"", Ribeiro said.
In addition, 13,000 qualified nurses have left the profession, leaving a taxpayer-funded black hole of more than €60 million, according to a report by the Swedish National Health Competence Council published in June.
""It is better [in Sweden] maybe than other EU countries,"" said Ribeiro. ""But we still have a big lack of nurses who may treat the health of the population. And we never know when the next pandemic can come.""
'A ticking time bomb'
But the reality is that there's a similar problem across the EU.
Public hospitals in countries around the bloc are confronted with parallel challenges, including an ageing population who will need more healthcare and difficulty in replacing healthcare workers who retire because the profession is not as attractive as it used to be.
""There is an increase of demand, basically because of four main factors the aging of the population, the increase of multimorbidity and chronic conditions, the backlogs accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of waiting list, and also because of increased expectations of patients"", explained Tomas Zapata, regional advisor on health workforce and service delivery at the World Health Organization (WHO) Europe.
He told Euronews that European countries' health sectors are facing a ""workforce crisis"", highlighted by the strikes by different types of healthcare professionals.
""We have more doctors and nurses than ever. So in the last 10 years, there has been a 20% increase of doctors in the whole region and a 10% increase in the number of nurses. However, the demand is growing at a faster pace. So that means that we are having this shortage, this gap between the demand and the availability of health workers"", he said.
A regional report published by the World Health Organization (WHO) Europe in September 2022 warned of a ""ticking timebomb"" threatening health systems in Europe and Central Asia.
It said that one of the main challenges is the ageing health and care workforce, noting that 40% of doctors in 13 of the 44 countries it looked at are already aged 55 or older.
The report also highlights poor mental health among those in the medical profession affected by long working hours, inadequate professional support, and serious staff shortages.
In some countries, over 80% of nurses reported some form of psychological distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As many as nine out of 10 nurses were thinking of quitting their jobs, according to the report.
All of these issues are forcing doctors and other healthcare workers across Europe into strikes, in an effort for better working conditions.
Germany demands 'top-notch' care
In January, thousands of doctors at state-owned university hospitals in Germany staged a strike after collective bargaining talks with hospital managers failed.
Some 5,000 doctors joined a ""warning strike"", organised by the Marburger Bund in the northern city of Hanover, the trade union said.
It demanded a 12.5% pay rise and higher bonuses for working nights, weekends and public holidays for 20,000 doctors in university hospitals.
They took to the streets again in March after the fourth round of negotiations with the 16 federal states (Länder) which run public hospitals, ended in failure. According to the Marburger Bund, approximately 7,000 doctors from 23 institutions across Germany took part in various demonstrations this time around.
""We cannot accept that university medicine remains the last wheel of the wagon in terms of doctors' salaries"", Andreas Botzlar, second chairman of the Marburger Bund, said in a statement.
""The recent round of negotiations has left us with the impression that the Länder still do not understand what it is all about: we are demanding fair conditions for top-notch medicine. Not more — but also not less,"" he added.
Slovenia sees longest-ever doctors' strike
Doctors and dentists working in the Slovenian public healthcare service went on strike in January, in what has become the country's longest-ever doctors' strike.
They withdrew their consent for overtime work in a bid to pressure the government into honouring its commitments to a previously tabled health reform and bringing it back to the negotiating table.
In 2023, Fides, the doctors and dentists trade union, signed an agreement with the government to create a separate pay pillar in the public sector payscale for healthcare professionals, but this never came to fruition.
""Employees are leaving public institutions, and good paediatricians are being penalised for their willingness to help the public sector,"" Damjan Polh, Fides president, said in a statement. ""Promises about reforms remain unfulfilled, and laws in the field of healthcare are written by those who do not understand it at all.""
The government adopted a proposal to amend the Medical Services Act, which would establish a minimum working time requirement during a strike ""to guarantee the stable operation of the healthcare system"".
Fides has appealed to Slovenia's Constitutional Court to question such a measure's constitutionality and legality. According to the union, it would ""further restrict the right of doctors to strike"".
Most recently, the trade union informed the Slovenian government in August of additional strike demands to protect the medical profession.
Controversial reform in France
Over in France, a measure of a different kind has sparked outrage among medical students: there will be 1,510 fewer openings for junior doctors this autumn.
Only 7,974 positions will have been opened this year, compared to 9,484 in 2023, according to official government data from July.
In France, junior doctors, or ""internes en médecine"", are medical students who have completed their sixth year of study out of 12. They work full-time at a hospital or in another medical institution under the supervision of a senior while continuing their studies.
""We are all very scared (...) The work in hospitals is very difficult, it is very demanding mentally and physically for junior doctors,"" said Marie, who is finishing her sixth year of medical studies. ""And now there will be fewer of us in the autumn while the workload won't diminish.""
According to the government, the number of positions was reduced because the number of candidates who took part in the competitive entry exams to win the placements also fell.
The figures have raised eyebrows among trade unions, however.
""Every year, there is an adaptation of the position openings depending on the number of junior doctors who run,"" said Dr Agnès Ricard Hibon, spokesperson for the trade union SAMU Urgences de France. ""Except that in this case, there have been way more people redoing the year.""
Medical specialisations will suffer to different degrees: general medicine and ophthalmology positions are due to fall by 18%, while there will be 15% fewer openings in emergency medicine.
""There are some disciplines like plastic surgery, which are more impacted. Others are preserved such as pediatrics or pediatric surgery because there is a huge need"", Hibon said.
Yet some students claim many of their classmates chose to repeat their year and failed their exams on purpose, as they were the first cohort to sit the placement entry exams which were brought in by a contested medical studies reform in 2020. They claimed they didn't want to be a ""crash test"" cohort.
Nevertheless, Hibon said the decrease in the number of junior doctors shouldn't have a major impact on hospitals: ""They are systematically supervised by senior doctors. They are not the ones who run the services,"" she said.
On the other hand, some students have launched a petition online asking for the reopening of junior doctor positions, which received more than 57,000 signatures as of September.
The petition states that the multiple academic reforms and changes in the way they are assessed and graded negatively affected their results and mental health.
As a result, around 1,000 students chose to repeat their fourth and fifth year and 400 other students failed the competitive exam, the petition claims, adding that certain positions have also become more competitive.
""A student who wants to carry out a placement in Digestive Surgery in Paris must be ranked among the top 23% of his class, compared with 35% last year"", the petition says.
It adds that consequently, many students will be compelled to choose a discipline which is easier to get into but they may not necessarily be invested in.
Medical student Marie warns some students would rather complete their studies abroad than give up on their ambitions.
She said she sees daily distress messages on Facebook support groups asking for advice on how fellow medical students can pursue their studies in Switzerland or Belgium.
To compensate, France might have to import foreign doctors in the opposite direction. ""There may be a few more open positions for foreign practitioners who want to come and train in France,"" Hibon said.
However, French medical students see such a solution as unfair, both to them and the foreign doctors who may come in. ""Foreign doctors are also being fooled because they are less paid than us, so they are also being exploited,"" Marie said.
More generally, the debate is taking place at a time when the whole medical sector in France is suffering from deteriorating mental health and working conditions — exhaustion, overtime, a lack of supervision, competition, important responsibilities and low wages — exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
All of these challenges have been bubbling for years across Europe, yet there may be hope on the horizon for the continent's hospitals by way of the Bucharest Declaration on the health and care workforce, which WHO Europe representatives adopted in 2023.
The declaration calls for political action to improve the recruitment and retention of health and care workers, improve health workforce supply mechanisms, optimise the workforce's performance and increase public investment in workforce education.
Yet it remains to be seen how countries will implement the declaration in practice, and regardless, the stakes are high: a doctor struggling with deteriorating working conditions will surely negatively impact the quality of care.
""When a caregiver is mistreated, we know 10 patients are mistreated after,"" Marie said."
5719,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-11-13,"South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) said Wednesday that North Korean troops sent to Russia as mercenaries have moved to the frontlines in Kursk over the past two weeks and are “already engaging in combat” against Ukrainian forces.
Kursk is the province in Russia invaded by Ukrainian troops in August, catching the Russian military by surprise. The Ukrainians seemingly hoped Russia would divert troops away from its invasion force to recapture Kursk, but instead the Russians turned to their “strategic partners” in North Korea for about 10,000 troops.
On Tuesday, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un ratified a “comprehensive strategic partnership” treaty with Russia, the most important defense pact signed by the two countries since the end of the Cold War. Among other provisions, it calls on each country to render immediate military assistance if the other is attacked.
“Today I can confirm that over 10,000 DPRK [North Korean] soldiers have been sent to eastern Russia, and most of them have moved to the far western Kursk Oblast, where they have begun engaging in combat operations with Russian forces,” State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said on Tuesday, providing the first official U.S. confirmation that North Korea’s soldiers are fighting the Ukrainians.
“Russian forces have trained the DPRK soldiers in artillery, in UAV and basic infantry operations, including trench clearing, which are critical skills for frontline operations,” Patel said.
During a meeting with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Secretary-General Mark Rutte in Brussels, outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed that North Korean troops are “now quite literally in combat.”
Blinken said Russia’s use of North Korean troops “demands, and will get, a firm response.”
Rutte also said NATO has seen “North Koreans being active in Ukraine.”
“These North Korean soldiers present an extra threat to Ukraine and will increase the potential for Putin to do harm,” he said.
Ukrainian troops have expressed their contempt for the North Korean forces, boasting of learning just enough Korean to tell them how to surrender and predicting the mercenaries would “die uselessly.”"
6215,real,GENDER_BASED_DISINFORMATION,2024-11-12,"Idaho women tearfully recount nonviable pregnancy diagnoses under total abortion ban
Four women are suing Idaho over its total abortion ban.
Several women took the stand in an Idaho courtroom on Tuesday to testify about their nonviable pregnancies as part of a lawsuit filed by women who were unable to receive abortions due to the state's total ban.
Rebecca Vincen-Brown tearfully described delivering her pregnancy in the bathroom of a hotel room after she drove seven hours to receive abortion care in Portland, Oregon. She passed her pregnancy after the first day of her two-day abortion procedure, with her other child in the next room, she testified on the stand.
Vincen-Brown, who was pregnant with her second child, discovered at a 16-week anatomy scan that her fetus had several fatal fetal conditions and was unlikely to survive. Doctors also told her that there were risks to her life and health -- including preeclampsia, hemorrhaging, high risk of miscarrying and risks to her fertility -- if she continued carrying the pregnancy.
Vincen-Brown began experiencing labor contractions in her hotel room and hours later delivered her pregnancy, but didn't go to an emergency room, she testified.
""We didn't have insurance to cover it, because we were out of state. We didn't have a car because our car was locked down the street in valet with a hotel, and so it wasn't necessarily an option for us,"" Vincen-Brown said, testifying on why she did not go to an emergency room.
""In the morning, a couple people from the clinic came to our hotel room, they collected the baby from the bathroom, and then I, they helped clean me up, and then walked over to the clinic and finished the procedure,"" Vincen-Brown testified.
Earlier on in trial, attorneys for the state made the argument that Idaho case law does not have protections for a right to fertility.
Getting an abortion alone
Jillaine St.Michel, also a plaintiff in the lawsuit, described making calls to over 20 clinics out of state to get abortion care after she received a fatal fetal diagnosis.
""It was the worst four days of my life. I can't describe it any other way. Knowing that I was carrying a pregnancy that was doomed, it had no chance of survival. Each day was worse than the last. And I would say, during those four days, my mental health got progressively worse and worse,"" St.Michel said.
At her 20-week ultrasound, St.Michel was told her fetus had several severe developmental and chromosomal conditions affecting multiple organ systems, and was unlikely to survive. She traveled to Seattle, where she received a two-day abortion procedure.
""Because we had to travel with my toddler, my husband had to stay back with her at the hotel and take care of her, so I had to attend both Friday's and Saturday's appointment by myself,"" St.Michel said.
St.Michel, a 38-year-old chiropractor, and her family have since moved to Blaine, Minnesota. At the time the suit was filed the family was living in Meridian, Idaho.
""Knowing what I went through, knowing what the state's representatives have decided is acceptable reproductive care for women. I can't imagine my daughter and son receiving that kind of messaging,"" St.Michel said.
""I want them to have a belief that women can make decisions about their health care. I want my daughter to feel safe becoming pregnant someday, if she chooses to do so and I just don't feel like that would be the case if we were raising our kids here,"" St.Michel said.
Leaving the state
At a routine ultrasound appointment around 19 weeks of pregnancy, Kayla Smith discovered her fetus had several anomalies, including several heart defects. Specialists informed Smith and her husband that their son, at best, would need a heart transplant before the age of 4 or 5, but that would only be a temporary solution for around 10 years.
Due to some of the heart defects, his pulmonary veins were not flowing properly and that could directly impact his lungs, Smith testified.
""If I were to continue the pregnancy, not only would I be risking my life of developing preeclampsia, but I was not willing to watch him suffer and essentially gasp for air,"" Smith said.
Smith and her husband drove over eight hours to the University of Washington Hospital to get an induction. They were given an estimate of $16,000 to $20,000 for the cost of the procedure.
They took out a personal loan to cover the cost of the procedure, Smith testified.
Smith, her husband and two children moved their family to Washington. They plan to stay there if the abortion bans in Idaho remain in effect.
Multiple fatal fetal conditions
St.Michel took the stand after Jennifer Adkins, another Idaho woman who had to travel out of state to terminate a pregnancy that was unlikely to survive after it was diagnosed with multiple conditions.
Adkins was one of 18 women interviewed by ABC News about the impact of abortion bans.
At a 12-week ultrasound, Adkins' doctors told her the scan revealed the fetus had excess fluid and skin edema -- signs of cystic hygroma -- and that her fetus likely had Turner syndrome -- a rare condition that results from one of the X chromosomes missing.
Adkins was told her fetus would likely not survive and there was a high likelihood that she would develop Mirror syndrome, a condition where the pregnant person develops fluid buildup and can develop preeclampsia, which can result in stroke or death.
Jennifer’s Story
Four women and doctors filing a lawsuit against the state are testifying in court on Tuesday and Wednesday as part of the ongoing lawsuit. The lawsuit is seeking to ""clarify and expand the medical exceptions to Idaho's two abortion bans to ensure physicians can provide abortion care to preserve a pregnant person's health and safety, including in cases of fatal fetal diagnoses,"" according to the Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed the suit on behalf of the plaintiffs.
The lawsuit was filed on Sept. 11, 2023, challenging Idaho's total abortion ban and its six-week ban. Idaho's total abortion ban only allows the procedure to prevent death.
Idaho is one of 13 states that has ceased nearly all abortion services since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022."

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Donald Trump on Monday urged a staunchly anti-abortion Christian group to stand up for “innocent life,” ambiguously revisiting an issue that Democrats want to make a focus of this year’s presidential election.
The former president and presumptive Republican nominee’s pre-recorded message praised the work of those attending the event hosted by The Danbury Institute, which is meeting in Indianapolis in conjunction with the annual meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention. The newly-formed institute is an association of churches, Christians and organizations that wants to eradicate abortion in its entirety.
A panel of in-person speakers doubled-down on that anti-abortion stance on Monday, and a top Southern Baptist leader called for a hardline position against in vitro fertilization. Albert Mohler, the president of the SBC’s flagship seminary, said IVF is a “commodification of the embryo” that assaults human dignity. He criticized pastors as well as politicians showing openness to it including in Alabama, which shielded IVF providers from prosecution and civil lawsuits after a state Supreme Court ruling said frozen embryos are children.
“We’re about to find out how pro-life the pro-life movement is,” Mohler said.
Trump has repeatedly taken credit for the overturning of a federally guaranteed right to abortion — having nominated three of the justices who overturned Roe v. Wade — but has resisted supporting a national abortion ban and says he wants to leave the issue to the states. At odds with Mohler’s view, Trump does support IVF access.
In his recorded remarks, Trump thanked the audience for their “tremendous devotion to God and Country” and said everyone needs to pull together to preserve their values, including religious liberty, free speech, innocent life and America’s heritage and traditions.
“You just can’t vote Democrat. They’re against religion. They’re against your religion in particular,” Trump said. “You cannot vote for Democrats and you have to get out and vote.”
Both Southern Baptists and Republicans at large are split on abortion politics, with some calling for immediate, complete abortion bans and others more open to incremental tactics. Polls over the last several years have found a majority of Americans support some access to abortion, and abortion-rights groups have won several statewide votes since Roe was overturned, including in conservative-led states like Kansas and Ohio.
Like the GOP, the Southern Baptist Convention has moved steadily to the right since the 1980s, and its members were in the vanguard of the wider religious movement that strongly supported Republican presidents from Ronald Reagan to Trump. The Conservative Baptist Network, one of the event’s sponsors, wants to move the conservative denomination even further to the right.
Although they criticized President Bill Clinton’s sexual behavior in the 1990s, Southern Baptists and other evangelicals have supported Trump. That has continued despite allegations of sexual misconduct, multiple divorces and now his conviction on 34 charges in a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through a hush money payment to a porn actor who said the two had sex. Trump gave his address on the same day he was appearing virtually for a required pre-sentencing interview with New York probation officers.
Many Southern Baptists say they see him as the only alternative to a Democratic agenda they abhor.

H. Sharayah Colter, spokesperson for The Danbury Institute, said in a statement that the presidential race was a “binary choice” and said Trump has “demonstrated a willingness to protect the value of life even when politically unpopular.”
And Mohler, who leads Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, and once an outspoken Clinton critic, wrote a column after Trump’s conviction attacking Democrats for supporting transgender rights.
“Say what you will about Donald Trump and his sex scandals, he doesn’t confuse male and female,” wrote Mohler. On Monday, he denounced Trump’s prosecution and conviction, other speakers tapped into themes of Christian nationalism, a fusion of American and Christian identity.
Trump has said he would not sign a national abortion ban and in an interview on the Fox News Channel last week, when commenting on the way some states are enshrining abortion rights and others are restricting them, said that “the people are deciding and in many ways, it’s a beautiful thing to watch.”
For over a year until he announced his position this spring, Trump had backed away from endorsing any specific national limit on abortion, unlike many other Republicans who eventually ended their presidential campaigns. Trump has repeatedly said the issue can be politically tricky and suggested he would “negotiate” a policy that would include exceptions for rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother.
Democrats and President Joe Biden’s campaign have tried to tie Trump to the most conservative state-level bans on abortion as well as a recent Alabama Supreme Court ruling that would have restricted access to in vitro fertilization and other fertility procedures that are broadly popular.
“Four more years of Donald Trump means empowering organizations like The Danbury Institute who want to ban abortion nationally and punish women who have abortions,” said Sarafina Chitika, a spokesperson for Biden’s campaign. “Trump brags that he is responsible for overturning Roe, he thinks the extreme state bans happening now because of him are ‘working very brilliantly,’ and if he’s given the chance, he will sign a national abortion ban. These are the stakes this November.”
When asked about his appearance before The Danbury Institute, Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Trump “has been very clear: he supports the rights of states to determine the laws on this issue and supports the three exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother.”
Leavitt also said, “President Trump is committed to addressing groups with diverse opinions on all of the issues, as evidenced by his recent speech at the Libertarian Convention, his meetings with the unions, and his efforts to campaign in diverse neighborhoods across the country.”

5391,real,ANTI_MIGRATION_AND_XENOPHOBIA,2024-04-24,"Rwanda's government says it is ""pleased"" about the UK's decision to pass a bill allowing to send irregular asylum seekers to the African country. But many, including the UN, continue to express concern about the policy.
What are the reactions to the Rwanda bill?
With the final passing of the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Act after a long marathon between the two houses of parliament in the UK, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that deportation flights of asylum seekers to the small African nation would start in the coming weeks.
""We are ready, plans are in place and these flights will go, come what may,"" Sunak said at a press conference.
Rwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makolo meanwhile said on Tuesday that Kigali was also ""pleased"" to learn about the UK decision to pass a bill allowing irregular immigrants in the country to be sent to the African country for processing and, if they succeed, for relocation.
According to Makolo, the government is looking forward to ""welcoming those relocated to Rwanda.""
But top UN officials, including UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi and United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk, have criticized London's plans, warning that this could establish a ""dangerous precedent.""
According to media reports, not everyone is enthused about the development in Kigali, either.
The opposition United Democratic Forces of Rwanda (UDF) party expressed concerns about the bill, as have various human rights organizations on the ground.
While some believe that the country's economy will benefit from the policy, with the UK paying Rwanda a reported €430 million over five years at the very least, others are worried that there won't be enough jobs to go around for everyone.
How did the Rwanda deal come about and what will it achieve?
The idea of the Rwanda bill was first introduced by former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in 2022, and has since been carried forward by two other prime ministers and as many Home Secretaries.
The bill is part of the UK's strict approach to irregular immigration since its departure from the European Union (EU), commonly referred to as Brexit.
Incumbent Prime Minister Rishi Sunak extended the Rwanda plan into his ""Stop the Boats"" policy, which is intended to curb the number of irregular migrant arrivals on British shores departing from the north of France and Belgium.
According to Sunak, relocating irregular asylum seekers to Rwanda will help end the business model of people smugglers bringing migrants and refugees to Europe.
However, despite the shadow of the Rwanda policy looming large for two years, the numbers of migrant arrivals on the UK's coast has only skyrocketed; more than 6,250 people have reached the UK by crossing the English Channel in boats so far this year, according to UK government statistics.
In 2023, there were at least 12 fatalities on this route, which is considered to be among the most dangerous in the world.
Why did it take so long to sign the bill?
The enactment of policy ran into multiple legal hurdles in the past two years, with the country's Supreme Court deciding last year that Rwanda cannot be regarded as a safe country to send asylum seekers to.
The lower house of parliament, the House of Commons, responded to that decision, launching a bill to essentially reclassify why Rwanda could be deemed safe. That bill went back and forth between the commons and the upper house of parliament, the House of Lords, for months in a process known in the UK as ""political ping-pong.""
The final shape of the document that was eventually passed this week includes some amendments from the Lords, though ultimately represents the government's original design.
Many regard the bill as an attempt by the ruling Conservative Party to increase their votes in the upcoming UK general elections, which are expected to take place in October. But with or without the policy, the Conservative Party is almost guaranteed to lose its majority, according to recent polls
What is Rwanda's government like?
President Paul Kagame and the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) have ruled Rwanda, a small East African nation dominated by rugged mountains and fertile plains, since the end of the 1994 genocide.
On paper, the country is a multiparty democracy. But political opposition is ""nonexistent,"" as the US development agency USAID puts it.
Kagame's three election victories have been plagued by numerous and credible accusations of irregularities, including vote rigging and intimidation. Officially, he won the 2017 presidency with 99% of the vote.
The nation is designated an ""electoral autocracy"" by the Varieties of Democracy Project, an international democracy database. And it earned only eight out of 40 possible points for political rights in the 2023 Freedom in the World report.
What about other rights and freedoms in Rwanda?
Rwanda has ratified international and regional instruments guaranteeing human rights, which are also anchored in its constitution and other national laws.
But several observers have identified significant rights issues in Rwanda, including extrajudicial killings, people being disappeared by the government and torture of dissenters.
This has had a chilling effect on freedom of expression and association by perpetuating ""a culture of intolerance of dissent,"" finds Human Rights Watch.
As for media freedom, ""beaten down by decades of oppression, the Rwandan media landscape is one of the poorest in Africa,"" says Reporter without Borders, which ranks the country 131 out of 180 on its 2023 press freedom index.
What about Rwanda's economy?
In 1994, Kagame inherited a nation torn apart by the genocide that saw a million ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus slaughtered in just 100 days, and destroyed Rwanda's economy.
Rwanda's economy still depends on subsistence agriculture and lacks the rich natural resources of many of its neighbors.
But reform-minded Kagame has steered Rwanda to strong economic growth and ""substantial improvements"" in living standards, according to the World Bank. GDP soared by 142% from 2000 to 2020 and the number of people living under the poverty line fell to 52% by 2016-17. The country cut maternal and child mortality, and its 13 million people now are among the longest-living in sub-Saharan Africa.
Ranked one of the least corrupt nations in Africa, Rwanda has also climbed 100 places in the past decade for the ease of doing business, to second on the continent.
Rwanda is below average, however, compared to other low-income African countries when it comes to private investment, which is hindered by factors such as the low-skilled workforce, its landlocked position and the high price of electricity.
Why is Rwanda beloved by Western powers?
With its stability and low corruption, Rwanda has become an aid ""darling,"" receiving $1 billion a year (€914 million) -- the most donor aid per capita in East Africa.
""It's the country that illustrates how development aid has been effectively used if all you're looking at is things like clean roads and nice fancy buildings ... but not paying attention to peace and security, its role in regional politics and, indeed, human rights,"" said Toni Haastrup, who holds the Chair in Global Politics at the UK's University of Manchester.
What is the situation like for refugees in Rwanda?
It's a mixed bag.
Rwanda hosts nearly 135,000 refugees, mainly from Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Not forced to live in a camp like in many other nations, they enjoy freedom of movement and have the right to work, own property, register businesses and open bank accounts.
Rwanda's ""economic inclusion"" refugee policies ""stand out as a model with lessons learned for East Africa and beyond,"" finds a 2023 report by Refugees International.
Despite this, refugees in Rwanda face prejudice and discrimination and most refugees are chronically poor. The vast majority (93%) live in camps and rely on a meager cash assistance of 10,000 Rwandan francs ($7.94 or € 7.27) a month to buy food.
Burundian refugee Kelly Nimubona told DW last year that life was tough in Rwanda. ""We can't afford to eat twice a day,"" he said, adding that there was no chance of getting work.
As well as the poverty, rights organizations say Rwanda's human rights record makes it no country for refugees.
Tellingly, the UK Supreme Court ruled in November that asylum seekers wouldn't be safe in Rwanda.
Why is Rwanda positioning itself as a safe haven for international refugees?
Last month, Rwanda received a new batch of refugees evacuated from Libya's notorious detention centers under a UNHCR partnership.
The country was also part of a now defunct and controversial policy to receive rejected asylum seekers from Israel. More recently, Rwanda signed agreements with the UK and Denmark to process asylum seekers, although either nation has yet to send any migrants.
Rwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makolo told local news site KT Press that Rwanda kept an open policy for refugees because people in the country know ""what it is to be on the move, or to be displaced, just because of the history of our country.""
But for global politics expert Toni Haastrup, Rwanda's refugee policy serves another purpose.
""It's a way of legitimating Rwanda within the international community,"" she told DW. ""You're not going to scold Rwanda in global politics if it's been accepting all of these refugees on your behalf.""

6171,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-05-02,"At an auction in England in 2011, one of John Lennon’s teeth sold for just over US$31,000.
How much are your teeth worth?
Teeth are amazing little miracles. They light up our smiles, we use them to speak and we chew with them more than 600 times at every meal.
Yet, in a society where 1 out of 5 Americans ages 75 and up live without their teeth, many people may not realize that teeth are designed to stay with us for a lifetime.
I’m a dentist and an assistant professor spanning clinical dentistry and craniofacial regeneration research. Researchers like me are still deepening our understanding of tooth development, with the ultimate goal of serving patients with on-demand regrown ones.
In the process, I have developed reverence for natural teeth and for the complex beauty of these biological and mechanical masterpieces.
Designed for lifelong function
The secret of teeth longevity lies in their durability as well as in how they are anchored to the jaw – picture a hammer and its hand grip. For each tooth, durability and anchorage are functions of the complex interface between six different tissues; each alone is a biological marvel.
For anchorage, the cementum, ligament and bone grip the tooth at its root portion that is buried under the gum. The ligament, a soft tissue that is about 0.2 millimeters wide (about the diameter of four hairs), attaches the cementum of the root on one end to the bone of the jaw on the other end. It serves to anchor the tooth as well as to cushion its movement during chewing.
For durability, however, the secret lies in the enamel, dentin and pulp – our focus in this discussion.
Enamel – the shield
The enamel is the protective shell that covers the visible part of the tooth above the gum. Thanks to its high mineral content, enamel is the hardest tissue in the body. It needs to be, since it acts as a shield against the constant impact of chewing.
Enamel does not contain cells, blood vessels or nerves, so it is nonliving and nonsensitive. Enamel is also non-regenerating. Once destroyed by decay or broken by misuse such as ice chewing, nail biting or bottle opening – or touched by the dental drill – that part of our priceless enamel is gone for good.
Because it interfaces with a germ-laden world, the enamel is also where decay starts. When acid-generating bacteria accumulate on unbrushed or poorly brushed teeth, they readily dissolve the minerals in the enamel.
Like hair or fingernails, the non-innervated enamel is not sensitive. The decay advances through the 2.5-millimeter thick (tenth of an inch) layer of enamel painlessly. When caught at that phase during a dental checkup visit, the dentist can treat the decay with a relatively conservative filling that hardly compromises the tooth’s structural integrity.
Because of its high mineral content, enamel is stiff. Its lifelong support is provided by the more resilient infrastructure – the dentin.
Dentin and pulp – body and heart
With less mineral content than enamel, dentin is the resilient body of the tooth. It is a living tissue formed of parallel tiny tubes housing fluid and cellular extensions. Both originate from the pulp.
The pulp is the tooth’s soft tissue core. Vastly rich in cells, blood vessels and nerves, it is the life source of the tooth – its heart – and the key to its longevity.
Like smoke detectors communicating with a remote fire station, the cellular extensions within the dentin sense decay as soon as it breaks through the nonsensitive layer of enamel into dentin. Once the extensions communicate the danger signal to the pulp, our tooth sensitivity alarm goes off: The tooth heart is in flames.
The inflamed pulp initiates two protective actions. The first is to secrete an additional layer of dentin to delay the approaching attack. The second is toothache, a call to visit the dentist.
The earlier the visit, the less the drilling and the smaller the filling. If caught in time, most of the tooth’s natural tissues will be preserved and the pulp will likely regain its healthy state. If caught too late, the pulp slowly dies out.
Without its heart, a nonliving tooth has no defense against further decay invasion. Without a hydration source, a dried-out dentin will sooner or later break under the forces of constant chewing. Besides, a tooth that has already lost a significant portion of its natural structure to decay, cavity preparation or root canal instrumentation becomes weak, with limited longevity.
In other words, the tooth is never the same without its heart. Pulpless, the tooth loses its womb-to-tomb endurance and mother nature’s lifelong warranty.
The tooth coming together
More complex – and more precious – than a pearl within an oyster, the formation of a tooth within our jawbone involves layered mineral deposition. As tooth development progresses in a process of ultimate cellular engineering, the cells of the six aforementioned tissues – enamel, dentin, pulp, cementum, ligament and bone – multiply, specialize and mineralize synchronously with each other to form uniquely interlocking interfaces: enamel to dentin, dentin to pulp, cementum to dentin and cementum to ligament to bone.
In a progress akin to 3D printing, the tooth crown grows vertically to full formation. Simultaneously, the root continues its elongation to eventually launch off the crown from within the bone across the gum to appear in the mouth – the event known as teething. It is about that time, around 12 years of age, that our set of adult teeth is complete. These pearls are set to endure a lifetime and are undoubtedly worth preserving.
Save your teeth, visit the dentist
Tooth decay, the most prevalent disease in humans, is both predictable and preventable. The earlier it is caught, the more the tooth integrity can be preserved. Since the process starts painlessly, it is imperative to visit the dentist regularly to keep those insidious germs in check.
During your checkup visit, the dental professional will clean your teeth and check for early decay. If you are diligent with your daily preventive measures, the good news for you will be no news – enough to make anyone smile."
2923,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-05-30,"Let Ukraine use Western weapons to strike targets inside Russia.
That message, long a priority for Kyiv and its fiercest backers, is now being voiced by a growing number of Western leaders. The United States has so far remained unmoved by this pressure, putting it at odds with allies — and in the company of the Kremlin, which has warned against such a move.
But there are signs this could soon change.
The debate inside the Biden administration over the issue is ongoing, and some top officials back lifting the restrictions on how Ukraine uses weapons provided by Washington, two sources with knowledge of the matter told NBC News.
That debate has gained urgency since Russia launched a new cross-border offensive in Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region earlier this month, and Kyiv has warned that it could also be massing troops for another incursion in neighboring Sumy.
Ukraine feels it has been left handicapped, arguing that the restrictions on its use of Western-supplied weapons have given Moscow an unfair advantage.
Russia “can use the military infrastructure on its territory for the war against Ukraine without any obstacles,” said Mykola Bielieskov, a research fellow at Ukraine’s National Institute for Strategic Studies, a government research group.
“As a result, there is a powerful asymmetry,” Bielieskov, based in Kyiv, told NBC News on Wednesday. “This has been talked about for a long time. It’s just that the Russian offensive in the Kharkiv region clearly showed this.”
The new urgency from Kyiv, which is still waiting for crucial U.S. military aid, has prompted a growing list of Western officials to back the idea of removing the restrictions on hitting targets inside Russia.
For much of the war, Kyiv’s partners have drawn a solid red line at letting Ukraine use the weapons they supply inside Russian territory, fearing an escalation from the Kremlin that could turn the conflict into a World War III.
The Biden administration has been consistent in this stance, perhaps worried that Russian President Vladimir Putin could retaliate using nuclear weapons — which he has regularly threatened throughout the conflict.
But with Ukraine outnumbered, outgunned and on the back foot, Kyiv has been making a public case for its allies to loosen their restrictions.
And it seems to be working.
French President Emmanuel Macron became the latest high-profile backer of the idea Tuesday. He suggested Ukraine should be allowed to hit military targets inside Russia from which missiles were being fired at Ukrainian territory, an apparent compromise position.
He was joined by German leader Olaf Scholz, who had resisted the idea but agreed to the concept Tuesday.
It comes on the back of NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg’s repeated pleas to let Ukraine use Western-supplied weapons to hit targets inside Russia, saying that not doing so hampers Kyiv’s ability “to defend themselves.” It’s a view shared by a number of European members of the alliance, including the United Kingdom, Sweden and Poland.
In previous debates inside the Biden administration over how far to go in arming Ukraine, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and CIA Director William Burns have staked out a bolder stance, supporting the provision of longer-range missiles and other weapons — and have often prevailed following appeals from lawmakers and European governments.
And on Wednesday, Blinken appeared to leave room for a shift on this issue, too.
“We haven’t encouraged or enabled strikes outside of Ukraine. Ukraine, as I’ve said before, has to make its own decisions about the best way to effectively defend itself,” he said during a trip to Europe that will include a NATO meeting Thursday. A “hallmark” of U.S. support for Ukraine, he said, “has been to adapt.”
“As the conditions have changed, as the battlefield has changed, as what Russia does has changed,” he added. “We’ve adapted and adjusted too and I’m confident we’ll continue to do that.”
The Kremlin has sought to ward off the move, with Putin warning European NATO states Tuesday that they were playing with fire and risking “global conflict.”
Moscow recently staged exercises to simulate the use of tactical nuclear weapons, in a likely signal to the West against deeper involvement in Ukraine.
The risk of escalation seems to be exactly what’s kept Biden reluctant to allow the use of American weapons on Russian soil, said Christopher Tuck, an expert in conflict and security at King’s College London.
“Putin’s comments should be seen in this light: he is attempting to feed the fears of those who believe that crossing this U.S. red line would move NATO’s relationship with Russia into a new and dangerous phase,” he said.
It’s clear from frustration building in Ukraine that it will not violate the ban unless the U.S. softens its position.
“We cannot, and this is a fact, risk the support of partners,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday. “Therefore, we do not use the weapons of our partners on the territory of the Russian Federation. And we appeal: give us the opportunity to retaliate against their military forces.”
His comments came after a group of lawmakers from both parties last week publicly urged the White House to give Kyiv the green light.
“Ukrainians have been unable to defend themselves due to the Administration’s current policy. It is essential the Biden Administration allows Ukraine’s military leaders an ability to conduct a full spectrum of operations necessary to respond to Russia’s unprovoked attack on their sovereign land,” the lawmakers wrote in a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.
But the Biden administration’s fears might be exacerbated by Ukraine’s increasingly daring use of its own weapons, mostly drones, to strike strategic targets deep inside Russia such as oil refineries.
A Ukrainian drone targeted a long-range radar deep inside Russia that forms part of the country’s ballistic missile early warning system Sunday, a Ukrainian intelligence official told NBC News. The official wanted to remain anonymous because they are not authorized to disclose details of the strike, which appeared to be the second in a week against infrastructure used by Moscow to monitor Ukraine’s military activities.
Although the U.S. is likely to remove the restrictions on the use of its weapons inside Russia eventually, Tuck said, Ukraine would have to be careful about the sorts of targets that it attacks and would need to avoid inflicting civilian casualties.
It’s also important to put any U.S. decision into perspective, he added.
“Russian forces have made slow progress in Kharkiv oblast, so it is likely that a U.S. decision would be in time to make a militarily useful contribution to the fight there,” Tuck said. “But it isn’t a decision that is going to change the course of the war.”"
6025,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-09-30,"The COP29 summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, is expected to lay the groundwork for a new climate finance target.
The worsening climate crisis presents a unique opportunity to revise the financial models used in developing countries. The upcoming 29th UN Conference on Climate Change (COP29), known as the Finance COP will be a pivotal moment for leaders to enhance their climate commitments.
Loss and damage, adaptation, mitigation, and the Loss and Damage Fund will be major themes of this COP summit.
Africa faces significant challenges due to the impacts of climate change, despite contributing minimally to global greenhouse gas emissions. The continent is projected to experience more drastic temperature rises than the worldwide average, causing heatwaves to intensify, droughts to endure longer, and floods to occur more often. Climate activists and experts in Africa have outlined several priorities they want to be addressed, including fighting for a new collective climate finance goal well beyond the previous $100 billion goal, addressing loss and damage as the central issue, and ensuring the implementation of the international carbon market mechanisms.
A new climate finance target (NCQG) will replace the current U.S. $100 billion annual target, marking a significant step toward addressing the urgent challenges from climate change.
In addition, the summit will focus on the regulation of carbon credits and transparency and strengthen Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) before resubmitting them in 2025. NDCs are fundamental to the pledge-and-review framework of the Paris Agreement, primarily aimed at achieving global temperature goals through mitigation. There is, however, a consensus that current governance mechanisms do not address the Paris Agreement's other objectives, including adapting to climate change and aligning financial flows with low-emission, climate-resilient development.
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC) Standing Committee on Finance reports that to fulfill the targets outlined in their NDCs under the Paris Agreement, developing countries will need between $5.8 trillion and $11.5 trillion by 2030.
In a conversation with allAfrica's Melody Chironda, COP29 Chief Executive Officer Elnur Soltanov called for an inclusive representation of African nations in global climate talks, especially around climate finance and adaptation. He said Azerbaijan is committed to ensuring developing countries, particularly African ones, are heard at COP29.
How is COP29 working to ensure that the voices of African countries are adequately represented in global climate negotiations, especially concerning issues like climate finance and adaptation?
As a COP29 Presidency, we know that the status quo is not working for Africa and that the continent's voice has not been adequately heard. At COP29, we will facilitate an inclusive process where the voices of all developing countries will be heard, and finance and adaptation will be prioritized for the most vulnerable countries, including those in Africa.
To achieve this, Azerbaijan will use its experience in leading inclusive multilateral diplomacy, most notably through its recent successful chairmanship of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and its efforts to ensure everyone's voices were heard, and their interests represented.
Our aim is for COP29 to create significant opportunities for African countries. Currently, not enough money is flowing into climate action in the region, and that's not just a missed opportunity for Africa, it's a missed opportunity for the world. We know that finance volumes need to increase and become more accessible for African nations to support their climate action measures. That is why we are working to agree on a new climate finance goal (NCQG), that will help more money flow to the region to support much-needed action on climate change both in terms of adaptation and mitigation.
At the recent meeting of the African Group of Negotiators (AGN) in Nairobi, agreeing on the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) was confirmed as one of Africa's key priorities for COP29. We want African countries to be a central voice in this debate and the COP29 Presidency has been actively engaging with the climate community in this region. The COP29 Presidential team has already traveled to Nairobi for the United Nations Environment Assembly and visited the Republic of Congo to participate in the International Conference on Afforestation and Reforestation, we also visited Ethiopia, carefully listening to their needs and priorities.
Loss and damage have been significant concerns for African nations facing the impacts of climate change. Given the central focus on climate finance at COP29, particularly concerning the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG), Article 6 on carbon markets, and the Loss and Damage Fund, how do you plan to ensure that the financial commitments made are ambitious and equitable, especially in addressing the needs and challenges faced by African countries?
Agreeing on a fair and ambitious NCQG is our top negotiated priority for the year. We are determined that the NCQG will deliver multiples that are adequate to the scale and urgency of the climate crisis. But we are not just focused on the size of the NCQG, we also need to make sure the qualitative parts of the NCQG, like transparency and accessibility of funding, work for developing country Parties.
We are also working more broadly to remove the barriers that stop developing countries from investing in climate action. This includes encouraging multilateral development banks and financial institutions to improve access to concessional finance.
We also hope to finalize the operationalization of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement at COP29 this year. Getting Article 6 fully functioning will enable greater international cooperation between countries to reach their climate targets, and in doing so, it will unlock more financial support for African countries.
Turning to loss and damage, despite contributing less than 4% of global emissions, Africa is the continent most vulnerable to climate change. In fact, 17 of the 20 countries most threatened by climate change are in Africa. Within the current list of the 45 Least Developed Countries, as classified by the United Nations, 33 are in Africa.
With African countries standing to lose the most from the climate crisis, we must act swiftly on loss and damage. The COP29 Presidency is working intensively with the Fund for responding to Loss and Damage to get it fully up and running as soon as possible, which is mandated with assisting developing countries in responding to economic and non-economic loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change. Azerbaijan hosted the third meeting of the Fund's board in Baku in September, where critical progress was made, including electing Ibrahima Cheikh Diong as the new Executive Director of the Fund and endorsing the hosting agreement and trustee arrangements with the World Bank. This lays the groundwork for the Fund to start disbursing funding in 2025, and we will use the COP29 summit in Baku to work with countries who have pledged to the Fund to convert these pledges into tangible funding.
The COP29 Presidency will continue to call for further pledges and remains committed to fully supporting the operationalization of the Santiago Network, which is working to catalyze the technical assistance of relevant organizations to implement relevant approaches in addressing loss and damage for developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.
How will COP29 in Baku shape the future of energy transitions in Africa, particularly in balancing the continent's growing energy demands with global climate commitments?
Africa is well positioned to be a world leader in the rollout of renewable energy projects, with 60% of the best locations in the world for solar energy generation. However, only 1% of the world's total solar capacity is installed on the African continent.
Currently, Africa's climate finance inflows remain very low, at 3% of global climate finance, and tend to focus on small-scale, fragmented, and uncoordinated operations, primarily in middle-income countries. To change this and allow Africa to realize its potential to develop vital renewable energy projects, we must increase the volume of climate finance and make it more accessible for African nations.
As a developing country ourselves, Azerbaijan understands these issues well, which is why we are working to agree on a new climate finance goal at COP29, that will help more money flow to developing nations to support action on climate change.
We are also talking to other stakeholders, such as international financial institutions, and multilateral development banks, as they have a unique role in mobilizing low-cost financing in developing countries, and we think they can do more to make the international financial system work better for developing countries, and for the planet.
What will the COP29 Presidency be asking of African countries at the COP29 Climate Change Conference in Baku this year?
This year, we are asking all countries to show that they are coming to COP29 with the highest possible ambition to act on climate change. That means taking all the action that we can on climate change, in light of our different national circumstances. Working with the UNFCCC, and the COP28 and COP30 Presidencies, we are supporting countries across the world to write new national plans on reducing emissions, fighting the effects of climate change, and improving the transparency of reporting on their efforts.
We see these national plans as part of the opportunity for African countries at COP29. By laying out detailed plans for how they will reduce emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change, countries are guiding investment into these efforts, and making it easier to attract investments. Looking at climate action as an investment opportunity, these plans will help African countries to balance economic development with climate action.
For this approach to succeed, we will also need to see developing countries submitting Biennial Transparency Reports (BTRs). To support these efforts by developing countries, the COP29 Presidency recently launched the Baku Global Climate Transparency Platform, which is designed to build mutual trust and confidence among Parties, support developing countries in preparing and finalizing their BTRs, encourage universal participation in the Enhanced Transparency Framework, and advance the transparency agenda beyond COP29. We have already held workshops this year to support countries, including many African countries, in writing their first national transparency reports.
We are also determined to lead by example. Azerbaijan is working on updating our own national climate plan and transparency report, that will align our emissions reductions to the pathway that keeps us on track for 1.5C.
As COP29 CEO, what are your top priorities for the conference, and what key goals and outcomes do you aim to achieve in Baku to advance global climate action?
I am optimistic that together we can make real progress when the world comes to COP29 in Azerbaijan. As a COP29 Presidency, we want everyone to focus on our moral duty and collective interest to confront the climate crisis. Ultimately, COP is a Party-driven process, and we need all hands on deck as billions of people are counting on the Parties to meet these responsibilities and seize these opportunities.
We will address our top priorities through our two-pillar plan for climate action this year, enhancing ambition and enabling action.
To enhance ambition, we will work with all countries to upgrade their ambition in line with the Global Stocktake, through national plans and reports on mitigation, adaptation, and transparency.
To enable action, we will bring the Parties together to agree on a fair and ambitious new climate finance goal, which can enable the delivery of climate action across the world, including African nations. This is our top negotiated priority for the year. Climate finance will lie at the heart of our efforts at COP29, as a critical enabler of climate action globally, which is why we are also working with the private sector and multilateral development banks to make the global financial system work better for people and the planet.
Through this two-pillar plan of enhancing ambition and enabling action, we will build the foundation on which all future climate action can rest, in Africa and globally."
6041,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-10-24,"Governments need to step up with stronger NDCs, the report says, while highlighting the role of solar, wind and forests.
The world is on track to warm up to 3.1°C this century without stronger climate commitments from governments around the world, a new UN report has found.
That’s more than double the 1.5°C Paris Agreement limit, which is intended to keep the world on a climate-safe timeline.
Countries’ current commitments for 2030 are not being met, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP)’s latest Emissions Gap report finds. Even if they are fulfilled, temperature rise would only be limited to 2.6 to 2.8°C.
“Climate crunch time is here. We need global mobilisation on a scale and pace never seen before - starting right now, before the next round of climate pledges - or the 1.5°C goal will soon be dead and well below 2°C will take its place in the intensive care unit,” says Inger Andersen, UNEP’s executive director.
“I urge every nation: no more hot air, please. Use the upcoming COP29 talks in Baku, Azerbaijan, to increase action now, set the stage for stronger NDCs, and then go all-out to get on a 1.5°C pathway.”
Is limiting global heating to 1.5C still possible?
The emissions gap, in other words, is huge. But it can still be successfully bridged.
Under the terms of the Paris Agreement, countries must submit new Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) every five years showing how they will curb national emissions to keep the world to 1.5°C of warming.
The next round of NDCs are due in February - though many countries, including the US and UK, have indicated that their new NDCs will be announced at COP29 or soon after.
UNEP calculates that nations must collectively slice 42 per cent off of their annual greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and 57 per cent by 2035, or else the opportunity to keep the 1.5°C goal alive will disappear within a few years.
The Paris Agreement’s overarching goal is to hold “the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels” and pursue efforts “to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.”
To stay within the upper limit of 2°C, UNEP says emissions must fall 28 per cent by 2030 and 37 per cent from 2019 levels by 2035 - the new milestone year to be included in the next round of NDCs.
“Even if the world overshoots 1.5°C - and the chances of this happening are increasing every day - we must keep striving for a net-zero, sustainable and prosperous world,” Andersen adds.
“Every fraction of a degree avoided counts in terms of lives saved, economies protected, damages avoided, biodiversity conserved and the ability to rapidly bring down any temperature overshoot.”
How can the world stay under 1.5C?
By cutting 31 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions in 2030 (roughly half of all global emissions in 2023) and 41 gigatons in 2035, it is technically possible to achieve the 1.5°C goal.
Renewable energy has a big role to play in doing so. UNEP’s report finds that increased deployment of solar and wind energy technologies could deliver 27 per cent of the total reduction potential in 2030, and 38 per cent in 2035.
Protecting forests, meanwhile, could make up around 20 per cent of the potential in both years.
UNEP also highlights vital opportunities in boosting energy efficiency and switching to cleaner fuels in the buildings, transport and industry sectors.
But delivering on even some of these potential emissions cuts will require “unprecedented” international mobilisation, it urges. Countries must take a “whole-of-government approach” to pursuing their climate aims. And G20 members, responsible for the around 80 per cent of all emissions, must do the heavy lifting.
""Today’s Emissions Gap report is clear: we’re playing with fire; but there can be no more playing for time,"" says UN Secretary-General António Guterres.
""Closing the emissions gap means closing the ambition gap, the implementation gap, and the finance gap. Starting at COP29."""
2211,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-04-19,"Moscow said a military plane crashed over the south of the country while returning to base from a combat mission after suffering a technical malfunction.
The downing of a Russian bomber used to fire cruise missiles at Ukraine would be a highly symbolic win for Kyiv, which has been pounded by hundreds of overnight Russian aerial strikes since Moscow invaded more than two years ago.
The latest overnight Russian strikes on the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region killed at least nine people and injured more than a dozen, Ukrainian officials said Friday.
“A child who was heavily wounded during a massive enemy attack on the Dnipropetrovsk region today died in hospital. The death toll had now risen to nine, including three children,” the office of Ukraine’s Prosector General said in a statement on Telegram.
Strikes were recorded on the region’s Synelnykivsky area – where at least two children, aged six and eight, were among those killed – and the regional capital of Dnipro, the interior ministry said.
“Unfortunately, the number of victims is expected to rise. The rubble of the damaged buildings is being cleared,” Interior Minister Igor Klymenko said in a post on Telegram.
He published photos showing emergency workers carrying injured people away on stretchers.
Life-saving air defence
After the strike, President Volodymyr Zelensky repeated his calls for Ukraine’s Western allies to supply air defence systems.
“Every country that provides air defence systems to Ukraine, every leader who helps persuade our partners that air defence systems should not be stored in warehouses but deployed in real cities and communities facing terror, and everyone who supports our defence is a life saver,” Zelensky said on social media.
In Washington, the US House of Representatives is gearing up for a crucial weekend vote on a long-stalled $61 billion package of military aid for Kyiv that could deliver much-needed weapons to Ukrainian soldiers struggling on the front lines.
Read moreTwo years after Russia’s invasion, Ukraine reorients its strategy to focus on defence
In a boost for their forces, Kyiv said it had downed a Russian long-range strategic bomber for the first time in an overnight attack.
“For the first time, anti-aircraft missile units of the air force, in cooperation with the defence intelligence of Ukraine, destroyed a Tu-22M3 long-range strategic bomber,” Ukraine’s military said in a statement on social media.
The plane was returning to its base in Russia after having fired missiles at Ukraine earlier in the night, the main intelligence directorate of Ukraine’s defence ministry said.
Shot down
Russian officials said the plane crashed over the southern Stavropol region, but blamed it on a technical malfunction. It said at least one member of the crew had died.
“A Russian armed forces Tu-22M3 aircraft crashed in the Stavropol region while returning to its base aerodrome after performing a combat mission. The pilots ejected,” the state-run TASS news agency quoted Russia’s defence ministry as saying.
“According to preliminary data, the cause of the accident was a technical malfunction,” it added.
One of the four crew members died in the incident, Stavropol governor Vladimir Vladimirov said in a post on Telegram, and two were taken to a local medical centre.
“The search for the fourth pilot is continuing,” he added, posting photos of the burnt-out and mangled fuselage of the plane in a field.
The plane crashed in the region’s Krasnogvardeysky district, the governor said – around 400 kilometres (250 miles) from the eastern edge of the annexed Crimean peninsula.
The main intelligence directorate of Ukraine’s defence ministry said it “was shot down at a distance of about 300 kilometres from Ukraine. As a result of the hit, the bomber was able to fly to the Stavropol area, where it crashed.”
Ukraine’s air force said Friday that Russia had launched 22 missiles and 14 Iranian-designed attack drones overnight – including from the downed strategic bomber.
It said all the unmanned aerial vehicles were downed as well as 15 missiles.
Russian strikes have pummelled towns and cities across Ukraine since the beginning of Moscow’s invasion more than two years ago. A missile attack on the northern city of Chernigiv left 18 dead earlier this week.

5770,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-10-03,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a controversial new law suspending criminal proceedings against individuals who are called up for military service or sign a contract with the Ministry of Defense to serve in the armed forces.
The move allows defendants, even those already on trial or appealing conviction, to avoid prosecution by joining the military.
The law represents another step in Russia's attempts to increase its military strength without resorting to the politically sensitive option of mass mobilization.
By targeting prisoners and defendants, the Kremlin can continue to recruit soldiers while minimizing public dissent.
The strategy, however, has raised significant human rights concerns, with reports of coerced enlistment, harsh prison conditions aimed at motivating inmates to join the war, and increased pressure on individuals awaiting trial.
The process has also come under fire amid a crime wave involving convicts who return from the front lines after fulfilling their service requirements.
Under the new law, criminal defendants will now have the option to enlist in the military at various stages of their legal proceedings.
This includes when their case has been sent to court or even during the trial process. The law also applies to those whose sentences have not yet been finalized, meaning individuals who have appealed their convictions could still avoid jail time by enlisting.
Initially spearheaded by the Wagner mercenary group, the convict-recruitment drive has since been taken over by the Defense Ministry.
According to a report by the IStories website, the Russian government plans to recruit around 24,000 defendants to serve in the war in Ukraine.
The publication quoted two lawyers and a source within the Defense Ministry as saying that pretrial detention centers and military personnel had already begun preparing for such recruitment even before the law was officially signed.
These preparations reportedly involved gathering information on which defendants were fit for military service and willing to sign contracts.
The source from the Defense Ministry estimated that roughly 40 percent of the approximately 60,000 defendants currently in pretrial detention were likely to be conscripted.
Lawyer Dmitry Zakhvatov told IStories that the recruitment drive was part of an effort to avoid a new wave of ""partial mobilizations,"" a move that could spark public backlash.
In September 2022, Putin's announcement of such a mobilization prompted tens of thousands of Russian men to flee the country, fearing they would be sent to the front lines.
Olga Romanova, head of the Russian human rights group Russia Behind Bars, confirmed to Current Time that recruitment from pretrial detention centers began long before Putin signed the law.
""As of January 1, 2024, 53 prisons have been shut down because the majority of inmates were recruited for the war,"" Romanova explained.
She added that over 20 prisons had been repurposed to house Ukrainian prisoners of war and were now under Defense Ministry control.
Romanova expressed concern over the worsening conditions in prisons and detention centers, saying that the harsh environment is being used as a tool to pressure inmates, suspects, and defendants into signing military contracts.
""Investigators are now using threats to impose the harshest punishments on suspects before their trials even begin, pushing them toward military service as a way out,"" Romanova said.
She also noted that law enforcement had started to detain individuals on minor charges, such as shoplifting or verbal insults, with the apparent goal of funneling them into military recruitment.
Romanova shared cases where detainees were threatened with lengthy prison sentences or harsh treatment unless they agreed to enlist.
Earlier this week, Putin signed a decree for the regular conscription of males between the ages of 18 and 30 for one year of mandatory military service.
The conscription period began on October 1 and will continue until December 31, during which an estimated 133,000 men are expected to join the Russian military.
While Putin initially assured the public that only contract soldiers would be deployed to fight in Ukraine, reports suggest that conscripts are often coerced into signing contracts shortly after their induction that see them sent to the front line."
3951,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-10-08,"AAP FACTCHECK – Some of the world’s most commonly used vaccines contain aborted fetal tissue, DNA and cells, social media posts claim.
This is false. While the vaccines were developed using human cell lines, there are no fetal cells, tissue or DNA in the finished product.
Facebook posts list common vaccines, including for hepatitis, rabies, chickenpox, shingles, polio and measles mumps and rubella (MMR), and claim they contain tissue, DNA, and cells from aborted fetuses.
“Human DNA from aborted fetal tissue is in vaccines,” an image posted on Facebook reads.
“Aborted fetal cells are ingredients in most vaccines,” another post reads.
Similar claims were made about the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine which AAP FactCheck debunked in January 2024.
Experts said the claim was also false for the other vaccines.
Vaccinologist Helen Petousis-Harris, from the University of Auckland, described the claim as a myth.
She said the misunderstanding came from the fact that some vaccines were developed using historical cell lines derived from two elective abortions in the 1960s.
She said cells from those lines have been replicated in labs for decades, creating a tool in which to grow the viruses needed for vaccines.
“In vaccine development, certain viruses are grown in specific cell lines because these cells provide a suitable environment for the virus to replicate,” Associate Professor Petousis-Harris told AAP FactCheck.
“The viruses are later harvested from the cell lines, and the vaccines are purified to remove any residual cells, ensuring they don’t end up in the final product.
“The vaccines themselves are completely free of human tissue or cells.”
Associate Professor Paul Griffin, director of infectious diseases at Mater Health Services, said the propagation of existing cell lines meant any product, including vaccines, that relied on human cells did not require new abortions.
“While it is therefore true that human cells (or cells of human origin) are used in the manufacture of these vaccines, these are grown in the lab and have been done so for a very long period of time,” he said.
“The actual vaccines however do not include any of these cells hence there are no human aborted foetus tissues or cells in them.”
The ability to use these cells to make vaccines and other products had undoubtedly improved and saved countless lives, Assoc Prof Griffin added.
The University of Sydney’s Professor Julie Leask, a social researcher who specialises in vaccination and vaccine hesitancy, said that vaccines including those for chickenpox, rubella and rabies do not contain DNA.
“The DNA from these fetal cells is no longer recognisable as human DNA because the process of growing the viruses kills the cells and the vaccine virus is purified which breaks down the cellular DNA.”
She added that the Vatican considered religious concerns about using cell lines from electively aborted fetuses in 2005, concluding that despite its lack of moral acceptability, such vaccines could be used in the absence of a suitable alternative.

6000,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-09-26,"Five days before President Vladimir Putin announced that he would loosen the conditions under which Russia might use a nuclear weapon against an adversary, one of those very same nuclear weapons had a spectacularly explosive mishap.
The Sarmat, Russia's newest intercontinental ballistic missile, a next-generation projectile that Putin has bragged about, erupted in an unexplained blast on September 20, leveling trees, buildings, and scorching the earth around the test silo at the Plesetsk launch facility, according to commercial satellite imagery.
In his September 25 remarks to his Security Council, televised to maximize attention beyond the Kremlin's walls, Putin made no mention of the accident. But he made sure that the world -- NATO and the United States, above all -- heard what he wanted them to hear: He was updating Russia's nuclear doctrine.
""The updated version of the document proposes that aggression against Russia by any nonnuclear-weapon state, but with the participation or support of a nuclear-weapon state, should be considered as a joint attack on the Russian Federation,"" he said.
Since February 2022, when he sent tens of thousands of troops across the border to invade Ukraine, Putin has repeatedly hinted, signaled, blustered, and threatened that Russia was ready to tap into its nuclear arsenal -- the world's largest -- to defend itself.
He hasn't done it yet. But he and other officials have kept up a drumbeat of threats, some veiled and some direct. And that keeps arms-control experts, military analysts, and policymakers awake at night.
Until Moscow actually releases the specifies that show the doctrine -- last updated in 2020 -- has changed, it's hard to figure out what, if anything, has, says Nikolai Sokov, a former Russian diplomat and arms-control negotiator now with the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Nonproliferation.
But it is certainly a signal, he said.
""I did not see anything fundamentally new, everything Putin said was there for a long time,"" Sokov told RFE/RL. ""He went much more specific on the existing policy, but he added new details, tailored to the current situation.""
""It represents a signal, a warning to NATO, as NATO continues to contemplate whether Western weapons should be used for long-range strikes,"" he said, referring to an ongoing push by Ukraine to get permission to hit more targets inside Russia.
In comments to reporters the following day, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that was exactly what it was intended to be.
""It must be considered a specific signal; a signal that warns these countries of the consequences if they participate in an attack on our country by various means, not necessarily nuclear,"" Peskov said.
'This Doctrine Is A Living Instrument'
For generations, Soviet and now Russian policymakers have relied on the tool of strategic deterrence in their policy toolbox -- trying to make another country do what Moscow wants by signaling, or threatening, the possible use of atomic weapons.
Over the past decade, Putin has markedly increased funding for Russia's armed forces, including its nuclear arsenal. That includes new models like the Sarmat ICBM, which has been put into use despite suffering at least three previous mishaps, as well as hypersonic weapons and nuclear-powered cruise missiles.
Russia's arsenal -- both strategic weapons, like long-range missiles, and less-powerful tactical weapons, like nuclear-tipped artillery shells -- is now the largest in the world; the United States is a close second.
Western planners -- particularly those who stay awake at night wondering when Moscow might decide to launch its missiles -- look closely at public statements not only by the Kremlin, but also the Defense Ministry and top foreign policy officials. The Basic Principles Of State Policy On Nuclear Deterrence is the formal doctrine that spells out when the weapons will be used, and under what conditions.
In 2020, officials released an updated version of the doctrine, though there were no major shifts.
Moscow could use its nuclear arsenal ""in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction against it and/or its allies, as well as in the event of aggression against the Russian Federation with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is in jeopardy,"" it says.
Many experts have focused on what might constitute an existential threat; one interpretation speculated that a popular uprising against Putin and his government might be considered to merit a nuclear response.
During a business forum in St. Petersburg in June, one prominent Russian commentator called on Putin to lower the threshold for nuclear use. Putin demurred, but said he was open to revising the policy.
""This doctrine is a living instrument, we are carefully watching what's going on in the world around us, and we don't exclude making changes in the doctrine,"" he said.
Russian threats of the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine were serious enough in the months after the February 2022 invasion, according to CIA Director William Burns, who said he warned his Russian counterpart against it.
But several events during the conflict have seemed to blur or even erase some of those red lines, adding more ambiguity into Western perceptions about Moscow's planning.
Ukraine's use of drones to attack early-distant-warning radars, used to detect far-off missile launches, spooked Western policymakers, since that might be considered a threat to Russia's strategic defenses as spelled out in the doctrine.
Putin has suggested that Ukrainian territories that the Kremlin has claimed to have annexed -- though no other country has recognized them as Russian -- would fall under the nuclear doctrine. Ukraine has continued to hit Russian forces, including with Western-supplied weapons, in many of those occupied territories, and Kyiv's stated goal is to take back all the land Russia has occupied.
In August, Ukrainian forces pulled of an audacious cross-border incursion into Russia's Kursk region. It was the largest invasion of Russian territory by foreign forces since World War II, and may have arguably met the conditions laid out in the doctrine.
NATO and the United States are now considering Ukraine's pleas to be allowed to hit targets deep inside Russia using long-range Western missiles -- something that Moscow has warned against.
The Kremlin's decision to televise Putin's comments before his national Security Council was indicative that they wanted to send a message. And it came one day before Zelenskiy was to travel to the White House, where he was expected to request long-range strike permission, among other things.
But Putin didn't in fact specify whether the doctrine had been formally updated, nor whether the proposal -- that a conventional attack on Russia by one country that is supported by another, nuclear-armed country -- would in fact merit a nuclear response.
Putin's remarks do not mean the doctrine has changed substantially, says Pavel Podvig, senior research fellow at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva.
""In fact, if you look closely and look at the history of the issue, there really aren't that many changes,"" Podvig said in an interview with Current Time.
""For now, everything remains just at the level of statements, and we also haven't seen any real steps toward escalation,"" he said. ""For now, I think, we need to be on guard, but on the other hand, we shouldn't react too strongly.""
""There is definitely more specificity,"" said Xiaodon Liang, senior policy analyst for the Arms Control Association. ""We should be thinking of this kind of separate from the more casual nuclear threats that Russia has been making.""
Luke Coffey, a former British Defense Ministry adviser and now a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington, says Putin's comments were aimed in part at Americans, with the U.S. presidential election just weeks away.
He ""is a very astute politician, and he understands how the issue of nuclear weapons plays out in the domestic debate in the United States,"" Coffey said. ""He's a master at this propaganda and information warfare.""
""What was announced by Putin today wasn't really a huge departure from what Russian doctrine has been, maybe he put a finer point on the issue of a nuclear state supporting a nonnuclear state attacking Russia"

Around €260 billion of Russian central bank funds are frozen worldwide, most of it in the EU. The funds generate €2.5 billion to €3.5 billion a year in profit, which the EU says is not contractually owed to Russia and therefore represents a windfall. The idea, championed by the US, is to use this profit as a steady revenue stream to service a large loan of $50 billion that could be raised on the market. Russia says any diversion of the profits from its frozen funds would amount to theft. Tapping profits from Russian assets has drawn concerns from some countries, but a US Treasury official said on Tuesday that the United States and its G7 partners were making progress.

As two female candidates lead Mexico’s presidential race, the question is “are Mexicans ready for a woman president?” In the race, Mexicans will have to choose between three candidates. Two women have taken the lead, the ruling party’s Claudia Sheinbaum, and the opposition candidate Xóchitl Gálvez. In all likelihood, Mexico — a country with historical levels of violence against women — will be governed by a woman for the first time. (AP video shot by Martín Silva Rey)
Mexican voters are poised to elect their first female president, a cause of celebration for many that has also touched off a flurry of false and misogynist online claims, blurring the lines behind fact and fiction.
The two leading candidates, both women, have had to respond to demeaning attacks about their appearance, their credentials and their ability to lead the nation.
The candidate considered the favorite in Sunday’s contest, former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, has also faced slurs about her Jewish background as well as repeatedly debunked claims she was born in Hungary. This week, in an apparent bid to undermine her candidacy, a social media account impersonating a legitimate news outlet posted fake, AI-generated audio of Sheinbaum admitting that her campaign was failing in a key Mexican state.
AS IT HAPPENED
Catch the highlights from the AP’s coverage as Claudia Sheinbaum made history.
The wave of election misinformation facing voters in Mexico is the latest example of how the internet, social media and AI are fueling the spread of false, misleading or hateful content in democracies around the world, warping public discourse and potentially influencing election outcomes.
“We have a general atmosphere of disinformation here in Mexico, but it’s slightly different from what is happening in India, or the U.S.,” said Manuel Alejandro Guerrero, a professor and communications researcher at the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City.
In Mexico’s case, that misinformation is the result of growing distrust of the news media, violence committed by drug cartels, and rapid increases in social media usage coupled with a lag in digital literacy. Guerrero added one more contributing factor now familiar to Americans: political leaders who willingly spread disinformation themselves.
Sheinbaum is a member of the Morena party, led by current President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. She faces opposition candidate Xóchitl Gálvez and Jorge Álvarez Máynez of the small Citizen Movement party.
Compared with election misinformation spread about male candidates, the attacks against Gálvez and Sheinbaum often take a particularly personal nature and focus on their gender, according to Maria Calderon, an attorney and researcher from Mexico who works with the Mexico Institute, a think tank based in Washington, D.C., that studies online politics.
“I was surprised by how cruel the comments could be,” said Calderon, whose analysis found that attacks on female candidates like Sheinbaum and Gálvez typically focus on their appearance, or their credentials, whereas misinformation about male candidates is more often about policy proposals.
“A lot of direct attacks on their weight, their height, how they dressed, the way they behave, the way they talk,” Calderon said.
She suggested that some of the sexism can be traced back to Mexico’s “machismo” culture and strong Catholic roots. Women only received the right to vote in Mexico in 1953.
Lopez Obrador has spread some of the false claims targeting Gálvez, as he did last year when he erroneously said she supported plans to end several popular social programs if elected. Despite her efforts to set the record straight, however, the narrative continues to dog her campaign, showing just how effective political misinformation can be even if debunked.
Con artists have also gotten in on the misinformation business in Mexico, using AI deepfake videos of Sheinbaum in an effort to peddle investment scams, for instance.
“You’ll see that it’s my voice, but it’s a fraud,” Sheinbaum said after one deepfake of her supposedly pitching an investment scam went viral.
As they have in other nations, the tech companies that operate most of the major social media platforms say they have rolled out a series of programs and policies designed to blunt the effect of misinformation ahead of the election.
Meta and other U.S.-based tech platforms have been criticized for focusing most of their efforts on misinformation in English while taking a “ cookie-cutter ” approach to the rest of the globe.
“We are focused on providing reliable election information while combating misinformation across languages,” according to a statement from Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, about its election plans.
The specter of violence has haunted the election since the first campaigns began. Dozens of candidates for smaller offices have been killed or abducted by criminal gangs. Drug cartels have spread terror in the lead up to the election, spraying campaign rallies with gunfire, burning ballots and preventing polling places from being set up.
“This has been the most violent election that Mexico has had since we started recording elections,” Calderon said."
3870,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-10-17,"Young people are smoking less (including e-cigs.) One product is on the rise.
Young people are smoking tobacco less than they have in a generation, a new study showed.
A survey of U.S. high school and middle school students found that the decline in tobacco use stemmed from a drop in the number of kids using e-cigarettes, still the preferred product among youth, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study published Thursday.
In 2024, 1 in 12 middle and high school students, or about 2.25 million youth, were estimated to have used a tobacco product in the last 30 days, compared with about 2.8 million children who said they smoked in 2023. The numbers were higher among high school students, 10% of whom said they regularly used tobacco products. Among middle school kids, 5% said they smoked tobacco.
The decline in recent years is considerable given that when the National Youth Tobacco Survey first began in 1999, about one-third of high school students used tobacco products, and 10% of middle school students smoked, said Kristy Marynak, a senior science adviser at the CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health. At that time, youth were largely smoking cigarettes or chewing tobacco, since vaping didn't exist yet.
Despite the good news, the work of anti-smoking campaigns is not over, Marynak told USA TODAY.
“We know that the tobacco industry continues to market youth-appealing products,” she said. “We really can't rest.”
The percentage of children smoking cigarettes reached its lowest level since the survey began. Just 1.4% of students said they smoke them, the online survey, of nearly 30,000 students between January and May, found. Vaping has topped the list as the most popular method of using tobacco for the past 11 years. In 2024, 6% of youth said they vaped tobacco.
But the number of kids saying they vaped dropped from 2.1 million in 2023 to 1.6 million in 2024.
Nicotine pouches were the second-most popular form of tobacco children said they used, and there was an increase in white students using them, the CDC study showed. These pouches are about the size of a chiclet of gum and contain nicotine, an addictive chemical found in tobacco. They are often marketed as a product to help people concentrate, Marynak said.
Overall, 1.8% of students said they used pouches. These are becoming a popular alternative to smoking, said Dr. Vincent Mase, an assistant professor of thoracic surgery at Yale School of Medicine. In addition to being smokeless, they don't require a person to spit out any waste and they have flavors like mint, citrus and berry. There is also less regulation of these products.
“They can be discrete,” Mase told USA TODAY. And these products are targeting younger audiences, he added: “It is something we need to be concerned about.”
While the overall number of children using tobacco declined, there was an increase in use among Native American and Alaska Native youth. The study noted ceremonial uses of tobacco in some Indigenous communities may limit findings. However, Marynak said the survey asked about specific commercial products, suggesting increases persisted among Indigenous youth outside of ceremonial use.
Black students also continued to report they smoked cigars, hookahs and cigarettes more often than their peers.
Marynak said experts are paying attention to smoking products, such as cigarettes, cigars and hookahs, because they are responsible for an overwhelming burden of tobacco-related disease and death.
""Continued vigilance is needed to continue to reduce all forms of tobacco product use among youth,"" Brian King, director of the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Tobacco Products, said in a statement. ""Addressing disparities remains an essential part of these efforts to ensure that we don’t leave anyone behind.”
The American Heart Association said the decline is encouraging because fewer children are becoming addicted to nicotine. The nonprofit expressed concern about the persistent use of e-cigarettes and new products, such as nicotine pouches.
The findings draw attention a ""critical need for strong regulation to prohibit"" tobacco companies from ""targeting communities nationwide with harmful products once and for all,"" Nancy Brown, CEO of the heart association, said in a statement.
The group urged the White House to finalize its rules for menthol cigarettes to halt the tobacco industry from disproportionate targeting of Black smokers, and called for the FDA to ban sales of other flavored tobacco products.

In the run-up to Budget Day today, 6 March, a new paper by a former World Bank economist and published by The Global Warming Policy Foundation warns that the UK’s current decarbonisation timeframe is unrealistic and threatens to be economically and socially unsustainable.

Professor Gordon Hughes’ paper comes two weeks after the ‘European Climate Investment Deficit’ report warned that European Union member states would have to fill an annual investment gap of €406 billion if its 2030 climate goals are to be met.
In his paper, Hughes reveals that a realistic estimate of Britain’s planned energy transition also has an astronomical price tag. Large investments in capital-intensive technologies for producing and consuming non-carbon energy are estimated to be a minimum of 5% of gross domestic product (“GDP”) for the next two decades and might easily exceed 7.5% of GDP.
The capital cost of the energy transition in the UK runs from 100% to 150% of GDP, which is about £2.6 trillion in current prices. However, just like the high-speed railway line HS2, the energy transition will experience cost inflation. “It would be reasonable to increase the expected cost by 50% or more to allow for the consequences of attempting delivery on short timescales,” Prof. Hughes said.
Although considerable optimism is required to believe the energy transition can be achieved within 20 years, for £2.6 trillion it would involve devoting a minimum of 5% of GDP to fund the investments required, Prof. Hughes said.
Our economic history tells us that there is no chance of borrowing an additional 5% or more of GDP annually for two decades to finance the energy transition.
… the only viable way of financing the UK’s energy transition is a drastic reduction in consumption to free up resources for the huge level of new capital investment required … Realistically the reduction in private consumption would have to be 8%-10% for 20 years. Such a shock has never occurred in the last century outside time of war, and even then never for more than a decade.
Ignoring the macroeconomic and fiscal constraints will almost certainly lead to yet another long-running policy fiasco like HS2 with results that achieve little in concrete terms. Rather than pretence and muddle, it would be better to extend the period and pace of the energy transition to match the resources that can realistically be afforded.Financing The Energy Transition: Do the Numbers Add Up? Gordon Hughes, March 2024, Executive Summary
Lord Frost of Allenton welcomed Prof. Hughes’s economic realism and said:
The message in this briefing from Professor Gordon Hughes could hardly be more urgent.
Either we must be honest with the public and be clear that they are going to have to pay at a currently unanticipated level, or we must extend the time period for the transition – that is, delay the net zero 2050 target, perhaps out till 2070 or 2075.
Failure to do either – sadly, perhaps the most likely outcome – will mean that we simply muddle on, pretending we are making progress, spending at high levels, but achieving little. Meanwhile, the rest of the world outside the West will look on, incredulous at this unprecedented act of economic self-harm.Financing The Energy Transition: Do the Numbers Add Up?

The innocent and the naïve believe that everything is happening by accident. The vindictive, senseless, cruel, destructive, insane, bureaucratic, dangerous and just plain bewildering government policies on farming are not happening by accident.

The innocent and the naïve believe that everything is happening by accident. Farmers around the world seem constantly bewildered and confused by policies and decisions which are designed to please the enthusiasts, calling for the closure of farms in order to appease the psychopaths calling for net zero. In an article in a British magazine (which, like others, seems to have fallen for the Green myths with all the mindless commitment of a teenager in love) one leading Green academic recently said “Farming has no option – it will have to be sustainable, otherwise it will not be sustained” and there were doubtless many Green heads nodding though I confess I was merely left puzzled.
Confused farmers describe new government policies as vindictive, senseless, cruel, destructive, insane, bureaucratic, dangerous and just plain bewildering. Farmers are encouraged to follow “biodynamic” farming methods whereby herbal and mineral preparations are used together with an astronomical calendar to guide sowing and harvesting dates. (I’m not kidding.) Nowhere is there more incomprehensive jargon than there now is intruding into the world of farming. Many farmers have been pressured into supporting the absurd re-wilding programme which is promoted with such enthusiasm by the climate change believers. The conspirators’ plan is to reduce the amount of land available for growing food in order to create food shortages, starvation and a consequent, inevitable reduction in the size of the global population. The aim is to allow between a third and a half of all land to go wild. Even parks are being allowed to grow wild, and gardeners are encouraged to let their grass grow throughout the summer. Re-wilding is leading to grass being left long and uncut on verges, in public places and in private gardens.
So what’s the underlying reason? (They always have a reason.) Well, long and uncut grass will dramatically increase the spread of ticks and the incidence of Lyme Disease. It will also increase the number of people bitten by adders. If you don’t see an adder and you tread on it then it will probably bite you. And all that long grass will dramatically increase the amount of hay fever. Plus, long, uncut grass on road verges and traffic islands makes road accidents far more likely. Re-wilding is part of the plan to make everyone miserable, ruin everyone’s health, make money for the drug companies and kill a few people.
In order to ensure that neither farmers nor members of the public encroach on land which has been set aside for rewilding (and the first re-wilding programme was introduced by the European Union some years ago in a scheme which was called “set aside”) wild animals are being released. In England, for example, bison, water buffalo, wild boar and beavers have been introduced with predictably disastrous results. The naïve assume that if land is left uncared for, fields will become wildflower meadows, full of daisies, tulips, forget-me-nots, snapdragons, violets and other wonderful delights. In reality, of course, fields which are abandoned to the re-wilding scheme simply become a chaotic and unpleasant mixture of nettles, brambles, dock and giant hogweed with outbreaks of Japanese knotweed growing rapidly over the years to come.
Today, most farmers see their problems occurring as a result of stupidity, ignorance or a failure to understand their needs. But what is happening to them has nothing to do with stupidity, ignorance or a failure to understand – it’s all deliberate and quite cold-blooded. More and more European countries are now dependent on imports for most of their food and energy supplies. And most of our food will be made in factories owned by billionaires.
The bottom line, vital to remember, is that nothing is happening by accident or by coincidence.
The above was taken from ‘Their Terrifying Plan’ by Vernon Coleman.

2518,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-01-08,"The internationally agreed threshold to prevent the Earth from spiraling into a new superheated era will be “passed for all practical purposes” during 2024, the man known as the godfather of climate science has warned.
James Hansen, the former Nasa scientist credited for alerting the world to the dangers of climate change in the 1980s, said that global heating caused by the burning of fossil fuels, amplified by the naturally reoccurring El Niño climatic event, will by May push temperatures to as much as 1.7C (3F) above the average experienced before industrialization.
This temperature high, measured over the 12-month period to May, will not by itself break the commitment made by the world’s governments to limit global heating to 1.5C (2.7F) above the time before the dominance of coal, oil and gas. Scientists say the 1.5C ceiling cannot be considered breached until a string of several years exceed this limit, with this moment considered most likely to happen at some point in the 2030s.
But Hansen said that even after the waning of El Niño, which typically drives up average global heat, the span of subsequent years will, taken together, still average at the 1.5C limit. The heating of the world from greenhouse gas emissions is being reinforced by knock-on impacts, Hansen said, such as the melting of the planet’s ice, which is making the surface darker and therefore absorbing even more sunlight.
“We are now in the process of moving into the 1.5C world,” Hansen told the Guardian. “You can bet $100 to a donut on this and be sure of getting a free donut, if you can find a sucker willing to take the bet.”
In a bulletin issued with two other climate researchers, Hansen states that “the 1.5C global warming ceiling has been passed for all practical purposes because the large planetary energy imbalance assures that global temperature is heading still higher”. Hansen has promoted a view, disputed by some other climate scientists, that the rate of global heating is accelerating due to a widening gap between the amount of energy being absorbed by the Earth from the sun and the amount returning to space.
Hansen, renowned for his role in publicly revealing the onset of the greenhouse effect to the US Congress in 1988, added that the looming loss of the 1.5C guardrail should provide a jolt the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the foremost body of climate science that has charted pathways to avoid breaching the target.
“Passing through the 1.5C world is a significant milestone because it shows that the story being told by the United Nations, with the acquiescence of its scientific advisory body, the IPCC, is a load of bullshit,” Hansen said.
“We are not moving into a 1.5C world, we are briefly passing through it in 2024. We will pass through the 2C (3.6F) world in the 2030s unless we take purposeful actions to affect the planet’s energy balance.”
Last year was the hottest ever recorded, scientific agencies in the US and the European Union are expected to confirm this week, with the global temperature for 2023 close to being 1.5C above the pre-industrial era. El Niño, which heats up sections of the Pacific Ocean and normally adds to the overall global temperature, is anticipated to be even stronger this year than last, before fading away.
Governments meeting at UN climate talks held in Dubai in December reaffirmed the previous commitment, made in Paris in 2015, to strive to restrain the global temperature rise to 1.5C, although scientists have warned the world is well off track to avoid this due to persistently high greenhouse gas emissions and ongoing plans for a massive glut of oil and gas drilling. Carbon emissions from fossil fuels hit another record high last year.
While the 1.5C target is a political as much as a scientific one, researchers say there will be worsening impacts in terms of heatwaves, droughts, flooding and other calamities should the world exceed this temperature. For developing countries and small island states at existential risk from sea level rise and extreme weather, the agreed goal is a hard-fought and totemic one, with “1.5 to stay alive” now a common mantra heard at international climate talks.
Hansen’s assertion that this year will herald the start of an escalating 1.5C era has received a cautious response from other scientists contacted by the Guardian. Drew Shindell, a climate scientist at Duke University, said this year was an “unusually warm one” due to El Niño and that following years will best judge whether the 1.5C target has vanished.
But he added the world was closing in on this point and the 1.5C limit would probably be hit “in the 2020s and not the 2030s any more given recent years have warmed so rapidly, so Jim’s larger point that we’re moving rapidly into the post-1.5C era is correct in my opinion.
“To my mind, whether it’s 2024 or 2027 makes little difference in the end to informing our actions – we have to change course immediately or we’ll lose our ability to keep below 2C the same way the 1.5C goal has now become out of reach,” Shindell said.
Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Stripe and Berkeley Earth, said “I disagree a bit with Hansen” that global temperatures will not be less than 1.4C above pre-industrial times once there is a countervailing La Niña, a reverse climatic condition to El Niño. “But longer term those sorts of temperatures will no longer be seen as the Earth continues to warm,” Hausfather said, adding that he still expected the long-term average to fully pass 1.5C in the early 2030s.
Andrew Dessler, climate researcher at Texas A&M University, said that he also expected it to take “10-ish years” to break the 1.5C barrier, but that Hansen’s views should be taken seriously. “Jim is probably the greatest climate scientist in history, so I am hesitant to disagree with him because perhaps he’ll turn out to be right,” Dessler said.
Even if the world’s temperature is to break the 1.5C barrier, researchers stress that this doesn’t mean that all will irretrievably be lost, with every fraction of a degree added, or not, significant in shaping the severity of climate impacts. By current government pledges to cut emissions – if not their actual actions to date – the world is still heading for at least 2.5C (4.5F) warming by the end of this century.
“I do think that in worrying about some particular threshold we are addressing the wrong question,” said Kerry Emanuel, a climate and meteorological expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “There are no magic numbers in climate change, just rapidly growing risks.”
Emanuel pointed to recent severe heatwaves, fires and storms that are already being supercharged by global heating of around 1.2C (2.1F) above what it was a little more than a century ago. “Perhaps, once half the population of the planet has experienced at least one of these weather catastrophes, they will get their leaders to act,” Emanuel said. “I hope it doesn’t take that much pain.”"
6173,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-05-01,"Brain cancers remain among the most challenging tumors to treat. They often don’t respond to traditional treatments because many chemotherapies are unable to penetrate the protective barrier around the brain. Other treatments like radiation and surgery can leave patients with lifelong debilitating side effects.
As a result, brain cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. Brain tumors in children frequently do not respond to treatments developed for adults, likely due to the fact that pediatric brain cancers are not as well-studied as adult brain cancers. There is an urgent need to develop new treatments specific to children.
We developed a new messenger-RNA, or mRNA, cancer vaccine, described in newly published research, that can deliver treatments more effectively in children who have brain cancer and teach their immune systems to fight back.
How do cancer vaccines work?
The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues and organs whose primary function is to continuously surveil the body for threats posed by foreign invaders – pathogens that damage tissues and make you sick. It accomplishes this by recognizing antigens, or abnormal proteins or molecules, on pathogens. T cells that recognize these antigens seek out and destroy the pathogens.
Your immune system also protects you from domestic threats like cancer. Over time, your cells sustain DNA damage from either internal or external stressors, leading to mutations. The proteins and molecules produced from mutated DNA look quite different from the ones cells typically produce, so your immune system can recognize them as antigens. Cancer develops when cells accumulate mutations that enable them to continue to grow and divide while simultaneously going undetected by the immune system.
In 1991, scientists identified the first tumor antigen, helping lay the framework for modern-day immunotherapy. Since then, researchers have identified many new tumor antigens, facilitating the development of cancer vaccines. Broadly, cancer vaccines deliver tumor antigens into the body to teach the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells that display those antigens. Although all cancer vaccines conceptually work very similarly, they each significantly vary in the way they are developed and the number and combination of antigens they carry.
One of the biggest differences among cancer vaccines is how they are created. Some vaccines use protein fragments, or peptides, of tumor antigens that are directly given to patients. Other vaccines use viruses reengineered to express cancer antigens. Even more complex are vaccines where a patient’s own immune cells are collected and trained to recognize cancer antigens in a laboratory before being delivered back to the patient.
Currently, there is a lot of excitement and focus among researchers on developing mRNA-based cancer vaccines. Whereas DNA is the blueprint of which proteins to make, mRNA is a copy of the blueprint that tells cells how to build these proteins. Thus, researchers can use mRNA to create blueprint copies of potential antigens.
mRNA cancer vaccines
The COVID-19 pandemic brought significant attention to the potential of using mRNA-based vaccines to stimulate the immune system and provide protection against the antigens they encode for. But researchers have been investigating the use of mRNA vaccines for treating various cancers since before the pandemic.
Our team of scientists in the Brain Tumor Immunotherapy Program at University of Florida has spent the past 10 years developing and optimizing mRNA vaccines to treat brain cancer.
Cancer vaccines have faced significant challenges. One key hurdle is that these vaccines may not always trigger a strong enough immune response to eradicate the cancer completely. Moreover, tumors are not made up of one type of cancer cell, but rather a complex mix of cancer cells that each harbors its own unique cocktail of mutations.
Our cancer vaccine seeks to address these issues in a number of ways.
First, we designed our vaccines by using the RNA of a patients’ own cancer cells as a template for the mRNA inside our nanoparticles. We also packaged our cancer vaccine inside of nanoparticles made up of specialized lipids, or fat molecules. We maximized the amount of mRNA packaged within each nanoparticle by sandwiching them between lipid layers like the layers of an onion. In this way, we increase the likelihood that the mRNA molecules in our nanoparticles produce enough tumor antigens from that patient’s cancer to activate an immune response.
Also, instead of injecting nanoparticles into the skin, muscle or directly into the tumor, as is commonly done for many therapeutic cancer vaccines, our mRNA nanoparticles are injected into the bloodstream. From there, they travel to organs throughout the body involved in the immune response to teach the body to fight against the cancer. By doing so, we’ve found that the immune system launches a near immediate and powerful response. Within six hours of receiving the vaccine, there is a significant increase in the amount of blood markers connected to immune activation.
Looking to the future
Our mRNA-based vaccines are currently undergoing early-phase clinical trials to treat real patients with brain cancer.
We administered our mRNA-based vaccine to four adult patients with glioblastoma who had relapsed after previous treatment. All patients survived several months longer than the expected average survival at this advanced stage of illness. We expect to treat children with a type of brain tumor called pediatric high-grade glioma by the end of the year.
Importantly, mRNA vaccines can be developed to treat any kind of cancer, including childhood brain tumors. Our Pediatric Cancer Immunotherapy Initiative focuses on developing new immune-based therapies for children afflicted with cancer. After developing an mRNA vaccine for glioma in chidren, we will expand to treat other kinds of pediatric brain cancers like medulloblastoma and potentially treat other kinds of cancers like skin cancer and bone cancer.
We are hopeful that mRNA-based vaccines may lead to more children being cured of their brain tumors."
2392,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-06-08,"I have been prescribing antidepressants since 1991. Like most medications, they are imperfect tools: they have side-effects and don’t work for everybody. Some patients report negative effects, or that their depression does not improve, and they may require changing to a different antidepressant. For those they do help, antidepressants undoubtedly improve depression and reduce the risk of suicide.
Very rarely, in my clinical practice, do patients complain that they cannot stop their medication because of the symptoms when they try. Unpleasant physical or emotional experiences for a few days or a couple of weeks after stopping antidepressants, yes: dizziness, headache, nausea, insomnia, irritability, vivid dreams, electricity-like sensations or rapid mood swings. But patients who could not stop the antidepressant because of these symptoms? In my 33 years of clinical practice, I can recall them on the fingers of one hand.
This is why I have been sceptical – along with what I believe to be most psychiatrists, psychiatry organisations and clinical guidelines – about claims in some scientific papers and the media, that “millions of people are addicted to antidepressants”.
“Addiction” means that users crave the substance and cannot stop taking it compulsively, as with opioids or street drugs. However, there is no craving or compulsion for antidepressants, and our clinical experience tells us that only a small minority of people experience disabling symptoms when they stop them. The largest ever study on the topic has confirmed this.
This analysis, which I took no part in, looks at 79 previous studies, encompassing more than 16,000 people stopping antidepressants, and compares them with more than 4,000 people ceasing to take a placebo. Pharmaceutical companies were not involved in this new analysis, although some of the data analysed was from trials funded by industry.
The most important finding is that the proportion of people who stop antidepressants and experience severe discontinuation symptoms (which would probably necessitate restarting the antidepressant) is 1 in 30 to 35 patients: much, much smaller than the previous headline figure of about 1 in 4 patients.
Even more fascinating is that about 1 in 3 patients who stop antidepressants experience some (not severe) discontinuation symptoms, but so do 1 in 6 patients who stop the placebo. This indicates that some of the antidepressant discontinuation symptoms are probably not a result of stopping antidepressants as such but rather to the attribution of some symptoms, especially now that there is an expectation that such symptoms would occur.
Of course, I am not suggesting that people who stop taking antidepressants are inventing symptoms, or that the symptoms are “all in the mind” – incidentally, an unhelpful expression that serves no purpose. Rather, the symptoms are real, but may be unrelated to stopping antidepressants yet erroneously attributed to this.
So, where does the discrepancy between previous alarming figures and this new study come from? Previous studies used less robust scientific research designs, because they did not include comparisons with a placebo, or they used a study design that preferentially attracted people who wanted to volunteer their experience of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms, biasing the results. For instance, online surveys are more likely to attract people who have stopped antidepressants and experienced symptoms rather than those who have stopped antidepressants with little discomfort.
This previous research, albeit less robust, had the positive effect of bringing attention to the debate around antidepressant discontinuation. This new study is not perfect, and in the weeks and months to come there will be debate about the quality of the data and analysis presented. However, this work represents some of the best available research on this crucial topic.
Because of that, doctors should now present these more accurate rates of discontinuation symptoms when discussing antidepressants with their patients. And people who have been advised by their doctor to start an antidepressant – indicating that they have a significant depression that is affecting their lives – should be reassured by the very low incidence of severe discontinuation symptoms. People who have been well on antidepressants for some time (six to nine months of wellbeing if it is the first time, longer if it is the second or third time) should talk to their doctors about stopping them. If they decide to do so, they should reduce it slowly over two to four months, while being aware that not all the unpleasant sensations and emotions they experience are down to stopping the medication. For the small minority who may experience severe discontinuation symptoms, a reintroduction of the antidepressant followed by an even slower reduction is needed.
People will make different decisions through an informed discussion with their doctor. Some will decide that antidepressants are not for them. Some will decide that they do not want to stop the antidepressant. Many factors will influence these decisions, but at least the now-debunked myth that antidepressants are addictive will no longer be one of these factors.

3962,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-09-20,"AAP FACTCHECK – A meat-based diet advocate claims that despite eating a diet high in animal fat, “Eskimos don’t get heart disease”, so “cholesterol is your friend”.
This is false. Inuit people suffer from heart disease, and eating a diet high in animal fat increases your risk.
The claim appears in a Facebook post sharing a video in which veterinarian and naturopath Joel D Wallach says: “Everybody knows cholesterol is a myth.
“It’s kind of interesting that the Eskimos above the Arctic Circle have a legendary diet that’s 98 per cent red meat and blubber,” he said.
“They eat nothing but whale meat and whale blubber … bear meat, bear fat. They don’t eat any organically grown broccoli or carrot juice.
“They’re legendary, legendary for not getting cardiovascular disease.”
The Facebook post includes the caption: “Cholesterol is your friend. The end.”
Research, however, shows Inuit do suffer from heart disease, although there has been debate about the rate compared to the general population.
Experts say eating a diet high in animal fats increases low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood, a major risk factor for heart disease.
In the 1970s and 80s, Danish researchers Hans Olaf Bang and Jörn Dyerberg published papers theorising about the high level of Omega-3 fatty acids in the Inuit diet in Greenland lowering their blood cholesterol, and protecting them against heart disease.
However, a 2014 University of Ottawa review found that the Danes had not actually studied Inuit coronary artery disease (CAD) rates, which were similar to non-indigenous populations.
Instead, the review said the researchers had made assumptions about Inuit CAD incidence based on medical records that may have under-reported heart attacks.
Earlier sources reported CAD was a frequent occurrence in northern Greenland’s Inuit population, the review said, with overall mortality twice as high as the non-Inuit population, and life expectancy 10 years lower.
A 1993 University of Pennsylvania study concluded from autopsies of Aleut mummies from Alaska that “ancient Eskimos … suffered from coronary artery disease.”
Aleuts are the Indigenous people of the Aleutian Islands.
Atherosclerosis, a buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the artery walls, was prevalent among ancient Aleuts, a 2013 multinational study published in The Lancet found.
Scans of five 16th-century Inuit mummies also revealed the “telltale signs” of atherosclerosis, Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital reported in 2019.
Cardiologist David Colquhoun, a board member of Australia’s Heart Foundation and associate professor of medicine at the University of Queensland, called the Facebook claim “a lot of garbage”.
He said the Inuit diet was not one to replicate.
“They don’t live long enough to get coronary disease,” Professor Colquhoun told AAP FactCheck.
“They’re not healthy. They’re lucky they can survive in such terrible conditions.”
Prof Colquhoun said saturated fat was the major dietary factor that led to increased LDL cholesterol, a major predictor of heart disease, heart attack and stroke.
Andrew Reynolds, a University of Otago senior research fellow and a technical advisor for the World Health Organization’s guidelines on saturated fat intake, said the post was clearly misinforming people.
He said Inuit life expectancy when traditional diets were more common was “shockingly low by today’s standard, only 30-40 years”.
“Given that the lifestyle or diet-related types of heart disease don’t normally present until people are 60+ years old, this statement that ‘Eskimos don’t get heart disease’ is beyond misleading,” Dr Reynolds told AAP FactCheck.
“It’s a brutal abuse of a historic health inequity to drive views or likes.”
The American Heart Association has said that decades of science “has proven that saturated fats can raise your ‘bad’ cholesterol and put you at higher risk for heart disease”.
The Australian, New Zealand and British heart foundations also recommend limiting saturated fat intake.
Science Feedback has debunked a claim made by Mr Wallach about Alzheimer’s disease.

The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines can cause rare and mostly mild cases of myocarditis and pericarditis mostly in young male teens and adults, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said.
Scientific studies have found no link between COVID-19 vaccines and sudden cardiac deaths in youth athletes. An April CDC study showed there is no association between cardiac death in previously healthy young people and the vaccines.

A Facebook post shared a photo of a New Jersey doctor’s office notice as evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous for student athletes.
The April 9 post highlighted parts of the notice that said ""COVID-19 vaccinations affect your risk"" of ""sudden cardiac death on the playing field,"" and that the office ""may not be able to clear"" vaccinated athletes’ sports physicals without ""lab work and possibly an echocardiogram to rule out potential heart damage.""
The post resonated with people who oppose COVID-19 vaccines. ""Amazing, even after they knew early on that the vaccine was affecting children's hearts, they still kept pushing it for even younger kids,"" one commenter wrote. ""And they called us all names for 3 years,"" said another.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The notice from the doctor’s office — Morris Sussex Family Practice in Lake Hopatcong, New Jersey (now called Morris Sussex Direct Family Practice) — is real. But one notice from a single doctor’s office does not equate to evidence that COVID-19 vaccines increase the risk of sudden cardiac arrests in young athletes.
(Facebook screenshot)
The notice was shared in a New Jersey school’s Facebook group in July 2022 and it has been on the practice’s website since at least March 2022, according to the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine.
The notice was updated in January 2023 to say that having a COVID-19 infection also may lead the office to require additional tests for sports physicals. The notice now says, ""COVID infection and COVID vaccinations affect your risk"" of sudden cardiac death.
But scientific studies have found no link between COVID-19 vaccinations and increased risk of cardiac arrest in young athletes. The narrative that the two are associated, widespread throughout the pandemic by groups opposed to COVID-19 vaccines, has been consistently debunked by journalists, including PolitiFact.
Featured Fact-check
Sports cardiology experts told PolitiFact in January 2023 that they haven’t seen a sharp rise in athlete cardiac arrest episodes since the COVID-19 vaccines came out.
There is a rare, but increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) mostly in male teens and young adults within seven days of receiving a second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said.
A 2022 study in England showed the risk of myocarditis from COVID-19 infection is substantially higher than the risk of myocarditis after a vaccine.
Health experts say myocarditis usually goes away quickly but severe cases can permanently damage the heart muscle and in some cases lead to sudden cardiac arrest.
But an April CDC study that focused on young people, although not specifically athletes, provides more evidence that there’s no connection between the vaccines and sudden cardiac deaths.
Investigators examined Oregon death certificate data from June 2021 to December 2022 for 1,292 people ages 16 to 30. None of the death certificates listed vaccination as an immediate or contributing cause of death.
Of the total, 101 deaths could not exclude a cardiac cause. Vaccination records were available for 88 of those people, and 40 had received at least one dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Of those 40, three died within 100 days of a vaccine dose.
Two of those people had underlying illnesses such as congestive heart failure and chronic respiratory failure, and the cause of death of the other was ""undermined natural cause."" A ""follow-up with the medical examiner could neither confirm nor exclude a vaccine-associated adverse event as a cause of death for this decedent,"" the study said.
""The data do not support an association of COVID-19 vaccination with sudden cardiac death among previously healthy young persons,"" the study concluded.
We rate the claim that a notice from a New Jersey doctor’s office proves that COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous for athletes False.

5995,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-09-23,"The number of people injured in a late-night air strike on the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhya increased to 22, including two children, the State Emergency Services said on September 23.
The air strike also damaged several high-rise apartment blocks, and the Ukrainian Interior Ministry said rescuers had to evacuate residents.
""Two women remain in the hospital, their condition is estimated by doctors to be of moderate severity,"" the State Emergency Services said.
RFE/RL's Ukraine Live Briefing gives you the latest developments on Russia's invasion, Western military aid, the plight of civilians, and territorial control maps. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.
News of the Russian strike on Zaporizhzhya comes a day after Ukrainian officials reported a similar Russian attack on residential high-rise apartments the city of Kharkiv in which 21 people were wounded.
A separate attack by the Russian military in Kramatorsk in the Donetsk region killed a 48-year-old woman and injured her husband, also 48, and two other people, authorities said.
Russia denies targeting civilians, but thousands of Ukrainians have died in such strikes since President Vladimir Putin launched the unprovoked, full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
The latest strike also comes with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the United States to attend this week's UN General Assembly and to meet with world leaders, including President Joe Biden.
Zelenskiy emphasized the importance of global unity and called on nations to continue to support ""joint efforts for a just and peaceful future,"" in his speech to the Summit of the Future at the UN.
""Putin has stolen a lot, but he will never steal the future of the world,"" Zelenskiy said.
The Ukrainian Interior Ministry said preliminary information indicated that Russia had used KAB guided glide bombs in the attack on Zaporizhzhya.
KAB bombs are a retrofitted Soviet weapon that the Russia military has used in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian officials had said it had been used in the most recent attack in Kharkiv as well.
Zaporizhzhya Governor Ivan Fedorov said several residential buildings had been damaged by the blast wave and debris, sparking a fire.
He sent tents had been set up to help residents of the damaged buildings.
Fedorov said that in total, Russia conducted 363 air and ground strikes in the past day on 12 settlements in the broader Zaporizhzhya region.
Russia also launched two guided missiles and four attack drones targeting Ukraine overnight, the Ukrainian Air Force said on September 23.
Three of the drones were shot down over the northeastern Sumy region, it said.
The two missiles and one drone ""did not reach their targets due to the active antiaircraft missile defense of the Defense Forces of Ukraine,"" the air force said.
Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry was quoted by Reuters as saying on September 23 that at least 31 civilians had been killed and 256 wounded in the Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk region as of September 5.
Three civilians, including a child, were killed by Ukrainian shelling of a village in Russia's Belgorod border region, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on September 23.
The Belgorod region lies to the southeast of the Kursk region and has come under frequent cross-border shelling and drone attacks in the course of the war."
2830,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-01-09,"2023 is officially the hottest year on record as global temperatures close in on warming limit: Copernicus report
Experts say that 2024 will likely feature further spikes in global temperatures.
A year featuring extreme events across the globe is now officially Earth's hottest year on record, according to Copernicus, Europe’s climate change service.
2023 has been confirmed as the hottest year on record surpassing 2016, the previous hottest year, by a large margin, according to a new climate report released by Copernicus on Tuesday. The data for this record goes back to 1850.
The global average temperature for 2023 was 14.98 degrees Celsius (58.96 F). The previous record was 14.81 degrees Celsius (58.66 F) set in 2016.
Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus, said 2023 was an exceptional year ""with climate records tumbling like dominoes.""
The record-breaking year, wrapped up with another new record. December 2023 was the warmest December on record globally.
The report also highlights that July and August were Earth's two warmest months on record along with the Northern Hemisphere's summer season also reaching new highs.
Analysis shows that 2023 was 1.48 degrees Celsius (2.66 F) warmer than the 1850-1900 pre-industrial reference level with close to half of the days in 2023 surpassing the 1.5°C warming limit. Two days in November featured days that were more than 2°C warmer for the first time on record, alarming experts.
""Not only is 2023 the warmest year on record, it is also the first year with all days over 1°C warmer than the pre-industrial period. Temperatures during 2023 likely exceed those of any period in at least the last 100,000 years,"" Burgess said in a statement.
While this sets a dire precedent, researchers emphasize that temporarily exceeding limits set in the Paris Agreement do not constitute a failure to the agreement. The limit set forth in the agreement looks at the climate average over many years.
Average air temperatures were either the warmest on record or close to the record on every continent except Australia.
According to NOAA, the last time Earth recorded a colder-than-average year was in 1976.
Greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels and strong El Niño conditions over the equatorial Eastern Pacific both played a role in sending 2023 global temperatures to a record high and could push temperatures even higher in 2024.
The World Meteorological Organization says that the current El Niño event is expected to last through at least April and will fuel further temperature increases in the coming months. El Niño impacts on global temperatures typically play out in the year after its development, meaning 2024 will likely feature further spikes in temperatures on both land and in the ocean.
Marine heatwaves all over the globe, including the Gulf of Mexico and North Atlantic, contributed to unprecedented ocean temperatures that set even more records.
Analysis of Copernicus' ERA5 dataset shows that global average sea surface temperatures reached record levels from April through December.
Record highs set both on land and in the ocean contributed to what researchers called a ""remarkable"" year for Antarctic sea ice. Both the daily and monthly sea ice extents reached all-time minima in February 2023 with 8 months of the year featuring record low extents.
An alarming number of extreme events were recorded across the globe last year, including record-breaking heatwaves, relentless droughts, catastrophic floods, and devastating wildfires. According to researchers, the unprecedented 2023 wildfire season in Canada was a major contributor to a 30% estimated increase in global wildfire carbon dioxide concentrations last year.
""The extremes we have observed over the last few months provide a dramatic testimony of how far we are now from the climate in which our civilization developed,"" Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change service said in a statement.
Globally, concentrations of two major greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide and methane, hit record highs in 2023 according to the report. Carbon dioxide levels in 2023 were 2.4 ppm higher than in 2022 with methane concentrations increasing 11 ppb year-over-year."

Time and time again throughout 2021, Dr. Anthony Fauci, stood at the podium, the bright lights of the cameras blinding him as he faced the nation. With a steady hand, he held up a vial of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, promising it would be the key to protecting America and its children from the “deadly” COVID-19 disease supposedly ravaging the country.
But little did the public know, the truth about the Covid vaccine’s safety had been buried deep within Fauci’s own lies and deceit and confidential U.S. Government and Pfizer documents.
Fauci used propaganda, lies and manipulation to coerce parents into getting their children vaccinated.
But the weight of the lives lost has quickly come crashing down on him and the nation, as a secret Centers for Disease Control (CDC) report has revealed that nearly half a million children and young adults died within a year of his fateful announcement with over 118,000 of those deaths suspected to be due to the Covid-19 vaccine’s dangerous side effects.
The CDC report should spark widespread outrage and be on the front page of every single major newspaper. But instead, it has been and will continue to be met with a deafening silence. Despite the staggering death toll the report will be buried and swept under the carpet.
The mainstream media, consumed with working overtime to distract the public with propaganda on the war in Ukraine, alleged climate change and the cost of living crisis, has paid and will pay no attention to the devastating consequences of Dr. Anthony Fauci’s deception.
The public will continue to be kept in the dark, and the U.S. Government will move quickly to cover up its own involvement in the tragedy. With Dr Fauci quietly announcing his “retirement” in August 2022.
It’s all business as usual and simply just another day at the office. But it is also a shocking failure of transparency and accountability, and the people of the United States should be forever haunted by the lives lost due to the Covid-19 vaccine scandal.

Compared to other countries, the U.S. Government has been terrible at publishing relevant and up-to-date data allowing us to analyse the consequences of rolling out the Covid-19 injections. However, we have finally managed to stumble upon it thanks to an institution known as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OEC).
The OEC is an intergovernmental organisation with 38 member countries founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade. And for some reason, they host a wealth of data on excess deaths. You can find that data for yourself here.
The following chart has been created using the figures found in the OEC database. Figures that have been provided to the OEC by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). And it shows excess deaths among children and young adults aged 0-44 across the USA by week in 2020 and 2021.
The official figures reveal that there was a slight increase in excess deaths among children and young adults when the alleged Covid-19 pandemic hit the US in early 2020.
However, with the introduction of a Covid-19 injection, one would have expected deaths to have fallen significantly among the age group in 2021. But instead, the opposite happened.
Excess deaths among children and young adults were significantly higher every single week in 2021 than they were in 2020 except for weeks 29 and 30. But then in week 31, something drastic happened to cause excess deaths to rise significantly among children and young adults.
And official figures provided by the CDC, unfortunately, show that trend has continued in 2022.
The most recent data released by the CDC covers up to week 40, the week ending October 9th, and it should be noted that the last few weeks of data are subject to change. But as you can see from the above, 2022 has also been a significant year for excess deaths among children and young adults.
Just for comparison, here’s how the figures for 2022 so far compare to the figures up to week 40 in 2020 and 2021.
The CDC has confirmed that there have been 7,680 more excess deaths among children and young adults in 2022 so far than there were during the same time frame in 2020 at the height of the alleged Covid-19 pandemic.
The year 2021, was by and far the worst, however, with 27,227 more excess deaths by week 40 following the roll-out of the Covid-19 injection than what occurred in 2020 at the height of the alleged Covid-19 pandemic.
The following chart shows the official CDC figures for all deaths and excess deaths among children and young adults across the USA prior to the roll-out of the Covid-19 vaccine, and after the roll-out of the Covid-19 vaccines on the 14th Dec. 2020.
The above figures reveal that the year 2022 so far has only seen 1,352 fewer excess deaths among 0-44-year-olds by week 40 than what occurred by week 51 in 2022, despite the year 2020 being the alleged height of the COVID pandemic and also including an extra 11 weeks worth of deaths.
But the most concerning figures revealed in the above chart are the overall number of deaths and excess deaths among children and young adults since the roll-out of the Covid-19 injections.
Nearly half a million people aged 0 to 44 have sadly died since week 51 of 2020, and this has resulted in an astounding 117,719 excess deaths against the 2015-2019 five-year average.
The average life expectancy in the USA as of 2020 was 77.28 years. If we are to believe the official narrative that Covid-19 is a deadly disease then we could perhaps agree that 231,987 children and young adults up to the age of 44 dying in 2020 resulting in 40,365 excess deaths was an unfortunate consequence of this disease.
But if we are to believe the official narrative that Covid-19 injections are safe and effective, then how can one explain the further increase in death among children and young adults in both 2021 and 2022?
Because we know millions of Americans were coerced into getting the injections, and we know millions of parents were coerced into forcing their children to also get the same injections.
The answer lies in the fact that the official narrative is an outright lie. The Covid-19 vaccines are neither.
The data provided by the CDC, which has been incredibly hard to find, only gives us clues as to this being the case with so many deaths among young Americans. But further data published by the UK Government confirms it.
One of the pieces of evidence confirming this is a report published on the 6th of July 2022, by the UK’s Office for National Statistics, which is a UK Government agency.
The report is titled ‘Deaths by Vaccination Status, England, 1 January 2021 to 31 May 2022‘, and it can be accessed on the ONS site here, and downloaded here.
Table 2 of the report contains the monthly age-standardised mortality rates by vaccination status by age group for deaths per 100,000 person-years in England up to May 2022.
We’ve taken the figures provided by the ONS for January to May 2022 and produced the following chart which reveals the horrific consequences of the mass Covid-19 vaccination campaign.
The chart shows the monthly age-standardised mortality rates by vaccination status among 18 to 39-year-olds for Non-Covid-19 deaths in England between January and May 2022 –
In every single month since the beginning of 2022, partly vaccinated and double vaccinated 18-39-year-olds have been more likely to die than unvaccinated 18 to 39-year-olds. Triple vaccinated 18 to 39-year-olds however have had a mortality rate that has worsened by the month following the mass Booster campaign that occurred in the UK in December 2021.
In January, triple vaccinated 18 to 39-year-olds were ever so slightly less likely to die than unvaccinated 18 to 39-year-olds, with a mortality rate of 29.8 per 100,000 among the unvaccinated and 28.1 per 100,000 among the triple vaccinated.
But this all changed from February onwards. In February, triple vaccinated 18 to 39-year-olds were 27% more likely to die than unvaccinated 18 to 39-year-olds, with a mortality rate of 26.7 per 100k among the triple vaccinated and 21 per 100k among the unvaccinated.
Things. unfortunately, got even worse for the triple vaccinated by May 2022 though. The data shows that triple vaccinated 18 to 39-year-olds were 52% more likely to die than unvaccinated 18 to 39-year-olds in May, with a mortality rate of 21.4 per 100k among the triple vaccinated and 14.1 among the unvaccinated.
The worst figures so far though are among the partly vaccinated, with May seeing partly vaccinated 18 to 39-year-olds 202% more likely to die than unvaccinated 18 to 39-year-olds.
That same report also reveals the mortality rates for children, although the UK Government did try to hide them.
The following chart shows the mortality rates by vaccination status per 100,000 person-years among children aged 10 to 14 in England for the period 1st January 2021 to 31st May 2022, according to the figures provided by the ONS –
In regard to Covid-19 deaths, the ONS reveals that the mortality rate among unvaccinated children aged 10 to 14 equates to 0.31. But in regards to one-dose vaccinated children the mortality rate equates to 3.24 per 100,000 person-years, and in regards to triple vaccinated children the mortality rate equates to a shocking 41.29 per 100,000 person-years.
Unfortunately, there is little improvement when it comes to non-Covid-19 deaths.
The Expose is 100% funded by you.

We’re...
The all-cause death mortality rate equates to 6.39 per 100,000 person-years among unvaccinated children, and is ever so slightly higher at 6.48 among partly vaccinated children.
However, the rate goes from bad to worse following the administration of each injection. The all-cause death mortality rate equates to 97.28 among double-vaccinated children, and a shocking 289.02 per 100,000 person-years among triple-vaccinated children.
This means, according to the UK Governments’ own official data, double vaccinated children are 1422% / 15.22x more likely to die of any cause than unvaccinated children. Whilst triple vaccinated children are 4423% / 45.23x more likely to die of any cause than unvaccinated children.
The figures provided by the Office for National statistics and both age-standardised and rates per 100,000 population. Therefore, they are definitive proof that the Covid-19 injections increase a person’s risk of dying. This means the Covid-19 injections have been and are continuing to kill people.
This is why it should come as no surprise to find that a secret CDC report confirms half a million American children & young adults have died following the COVID vaccine roll-out. resulting in nearly 118,00 excess deaths against the 2015-2019 five-year average.
If happy endings existed in the real world then this nightmare would end with Dr. Anthony Fauci sitting alone in his prison cell, the weight of his actions weighing heavily on his mind. Not being able to do anything but think of the innocent lives lost because of his deceit.
He has been hailed as a hero, even a saviour, but he is nothing more than a monster who sacrificed the safety and lives of America’s children for his own ambition and greed.
He may have even thought he was doing the right thing. If you repeat a lie often enough then eventually you may come to believe it. But in the end, his actions had dire consequences for the nation and in time hopefully for his own soul.

The study titled “Reports of COVID-19 Vaccine Adverse Events in Predominantly Republican vs Democratic States” was published in the JAMA medical journal and looked at 620,456 vaccine adverse events across the entire country.
They study found that a 10 percent increase in state-level Republican voting was linked to increased odds of adverse event reports. This relationship between political inclination and reports of adverse events was comparatively not seen when it came to flu vaccines.
The disturbing results seem to confirm the allegations made by a former Big Pharma research and development executive who bravely came forward last year and admitted that the industry intentionally turned some batches into “rapid kill lots” designed to depopulate targeted demographics.
According to Sasha Latypova, Covid mRNA vaccines are causing variable rates of adverse events because Big Pharma intentionally created “hot batches” to be deployed in predominantly “white, conservative” parts of the country.
If you thought the Great Replacement was nothing more than a conspiracy theory, you might want to think again.
The Exposé published a report of data found in the US government’s VAERS – the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which reveals that 100% of Covid-19 vaccine deaths were caused by just 5% of the batches.
These batches can be identified.
And here’s the kicker: these batches were not distributed randomly.
The eight US states with the highest vaccine death rate per vaccination – Kentucky, Arkansas, Wyoming, Tennessee, West Virginia, Montana, Alaska, and North Dakota – are all red states. 19 of the top 24 on the list are all red states. And the state that has the lowest vaccine death rate from the deadly batches of vaccine? You guessed it, California.
The numbers show that Kentucky has a 1,900% worse vaccine death rate than California, suggesting the red state received 20 times the amount of deadly batches of vaccine than Commiefornia received.
The author points out that these deadly batches of vaccine would be better described as “rapid kill lots” and “slow kill lots” as we are now seeing more evidence that they also kill over time. And red states were targeted with rapid kill lots. Watch:"
3746,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-09-25,"Thai king signs same-sex marriage bill into law
Thailand's king has signed a marriage equality bill into law, making the country the first in South East Asia to recognise same-sex unions.
The bill cleared the Senate in June but required royal endorsement to become law. It was published in the Royal Gazette on Tuesday and will come into effect on 22 January next year.
Activists hailed the move as historic - it marks the culmination of years of campaigning for marriage equality.
Thailand has long been seen as a relative haven for the LGBTQ+ community in a region where such attitudes are rare.
The new law uses gender-neutral terms in place of ""husbands"", ""wives"", ""men"" and ""women"". And it grants same-sex couples adoption and inheritance rights.
“Today we’re not only getting to write our names in marriage certificates, but we are also writing a page in history... that tells us that love never set a condition of who we were born to be,"" Ann Chumaporn, a longtime LGBTQ+ activist and co-founder of the Bangkok Pride movement, told the BBC.
""It’s a triumph of equality and human dignity.""
She said she plans to organise a mass wedding for more than 1,000 LGBTQ+ couples on 22 January.
""[The legal recognition] means we are fully accepted and can live our lives without conditions or compromises,"" said advertising strategist Kwankaow Koosakulnirund.
""Thailand’s LGBTQ+ community can now look toward a future beyond relationships, embracing the sense of pride that this law brings,"" he said.
""We are all delighted and excited. We've been fighting for our rights for over 10 years, and now it's finally happening,"" another activist, Siritata Ninlapruek, told AFP news agency.
Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra posted on X: ""Congratulations on everyone's love. #LoveWins.""
Former PM Srettha Thavisin, who has been vocal in his support for the bill, also applauded the development as a ""significant step"" for Thailand.
""Equity and equality have become concrete in the Thai society. Gender diversity will eventually be fully accepted. Congratulations,"" he wrote on X.
When the law comes into effect, Thailand will become only the third place in Asia, after Taiwan and Nepal, where same-sex couples can get married.
In 2019, Taiwan's parliament became the first in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage. Nepal registered its first same-sex union in November last year, five months after its Supreme Court ruled in favour of it.
This was just one month after India's top court had ruled against it, leaving the decision to the government, which said it would set up a panel to decide on more legal rights for same-sex couples.
Singapore scrapped a colonial-era law that banned gay sex in 2022, but also amended its constitution to prevent the courts from challenging the definition of marriage as one between a man and a woman.

3623,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-09-26,"Researchers investigate potential link between RSV and sudden unexpected infant deaths
Rates of SUID per 100,000 live births rose by 10% from 2019 to 2021.
A rise in rates of sudden unexpected infant deaths may have been linked to an off-season surge of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 2021, according to a new study published Thursday in the journal JAMA Open Network.
Sudden unexpected infant deaths (SUID) includes deaths of infants under one year old without a known cause, deaths that are due to accidental suffocation or strangulation in bed and those from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
""This is an important topic because SIDS and other unexpected deaths are still one of the leading causes of infant mortality, and there's still a lot unknown,"" said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist and chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor.
The most recent CDC data shows about 3,700 infants died from SUID in 2022 and 41% were from SIDS.
""There are very few things that are as horrific as a family experiencing a sudden infant death, and especially given the causes are so often unknown,"" Brownstein said.
Using records from the CDC, researchers analyzed more than 14,000 cases of SUID and found that rates per 100,000 live births increased by 10% from 2019 to 2021.
Results showed the risk of SUID was highest from June to December 2021 -- at the same time there was an off-season surge in hospitalizations due to RSV after the virus skipped its typical winter season in 2020.
Influenza hospitalizations were rare during this time and hospitalizations from COVID-19 did not have any clear association with monthly changes in SUID rates in the study.
These findings may indicate a connection between the risk of SUID and seasonal shifts in infections like RSV, but more research is needed to better understand this link.
""The findings underscore the importance of monitoring infant mortality during and after pandemics and obviously it puts big support for vaccinations and RSV prevention,"" Brownstein said.
Currently, there are newer RSV shots available that doctors say are important to help prevent RSV and give babies the best protection against this virus that hospitalizes thousands of kids a year, mostly babies.
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends pregnant women get an RSV vaccine between 32 and 36 weeks of pregnancy to pass on antibody protection to newborns.
The CDC recommends an RSV antibody shot called nirsevimab for all babies less than 8 months old unless their mother received an RSV vaccine in pregnancy at least 2 weeks before birth.
While nirsevimab had supply constraints last year in its first season, Sanofi, the drug manufacturer, recently announced they have started shipping shots to doctors' offices and anticipate having enough doses for all eligible babies in the US this RSV season.
Doctors say safe sleep is also important for SUID prevention. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants sleep alone, placed down on their back on a firm, flat surface, with nothing in the sleeping area other than a fitted sheet.

3631,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-10-15,"Infections, sewage and mosquito-borne illness outlast hurricanes
Since Hurricane Helene, it's been a colossal undertaking to get clean water at Asheville's Mission Hospital, the only designated trauma center in western North Carolina.
Hospitals like Mission need potable water for staff to sanitize equipment, clean wounds and simply wash their hands with soap. Other facilities − such as Asheville's Planned Parenthood clinic and local birthing centers − were forced to cut key health services because they didn't have running water.
The surrounding community has been battling an array of public health challenges in the aftermath of the historic deluge in late September, including residents' risk of being exposed to sewage, toxic industrial waste and mosquito-borne illnesses.
However, experts say the lack of potable water is the area's biggest concern. Without it, residents are limited in their access to nutrition and sanitation and more likely to be exposed to disease and infections, according to Dr. Daniel Kuritzkes, chief of Brigham and Women’s Hospital’s infectious diseases division, in Boston.
Overwhelmed hospitals are struggling to treat new and existing patients as they cart in truckloads of water and dig new wells.
“You're going to have patients that have short-term injuries that end up being chronic issues,” Marquita Lyons-Smith, director of North Carolina Central University’s nursing program, told USA TODAY. “Because they were not taken care of immediately, given the attention they deserve.”
Before the storm, many rural communities were already facing hospitals shuttering, putting care farther from reach, she said.
Contaminated water, infections abound
Each day, Mission Hospital brings more than 30 trucks to pump more than 200,000 gallons of water into the facility, according to hospital spokesperson Nancy Lindell. The facility is considering drilling additional wells so its HVAC units can continue to regulate indoor temperatures.
The hospital and region are stymied because water pipes are damaged, and sewage and chemical toxins have contaminated the water supply, making residents vulnerable to diarrheal diseases, fever, dehydration and other ailments.
Other dangers lurk. Mold from floodwaters can flourish, triggering respiratory issues. Standing water fosters mosquito breeding, Kuritzkes said, which increases the risk of dengue or West Nile virus. North and South America have seen record levels of people infected with dengue in the past year, sparking concerns for increased transmission as warming climates push disease-carrying mosquitoes into more areas across the U.S.
'The tip of the iceberg'
Along with the threat of infectious diseases, hospitals in North Carolina are also busy treating injuries that happened during the storms.
This is also the case in central Florida following Hurricane Milton, which left Gulf Coast residents coping with injuries that happened during the flooding, powerful winds and tornadoes. Amid power outages in both storm-battered regions, people turned on generators, which can trigger carbon monoxide poisoning stored in an enclosed setting.
After the waters recede, people's preexisting chronic health conditions such as heart disease and diabetes can worsen because people don't have access to medication or treatment. Sixty percent of Americans have at least one chronic condition, and more than 40% have multiple chronic conditions, according to the CDC.
In the aftermath of a storm, the death toll can rise because people can't access blood pressure medication or dialysis, according to Kuritzkes, of Brigham and Women’s Hospital. People with disabilities also face challenges accessing help in emergencies.
Over 230 people died in the wake of Helene, most in North Carolina, and 17 due to the impact of Milton, in Florida.
“These numbers, they’re very devastating, but also relatively low,” Jeffrey Schlegelmilch, director of Columbia Climate School’s National Center for Disaster Preparedness, told USA TODAY. “We can't forget that, actually, that's really just the tip of the iceberg.”
Hotter ocean waters caused by greenhouse gas emissions make storms stronger and they can develop more swiftly into hurricanes. This gives residents less time to prepare or evacuate, akin to what happened during Helene and Milton.
Public health officials need to learn to react more quickly, even when the risk of a hurricane or flood doesn't seem significant or imminent at the moment, said Dr. Giridhar Mallya, a senior policy officer at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
Severe weather events are becoming more common, he said. ""Public health has to be part of the planning and response.""

3942,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-09-13,"AAP FACTCHECK – A school teacher was arrested for not endorsing “transgender ideology” and refusing to use a student’s preferred pronouns, social media posts claim.
This is misleading. While Irish teacher Enoch Burke was suspended and later dismissed for confronting his school’s principal over a directive relating to a transgender child, he was arrested for not complying with a court injunction to stay away from the school.
In September he was jailed for a third time for violating court orders.
Some social media posts have claimed the teacher was “arrested for not calling a boy a ‘girl’” and for “not endorsing transgenderism“, with many posts sharing a clip showing Burke being arrested by police.
In June 2022, the secondary school teacher and evangelical Christian was suspended from Wilson’s Hospital School, in Ireland’s Westmeath county, for alleged misconduct.
This came after he publicly confronted the then-principal and objected to a directive to call a student by they/them pronouns.
A May 2023 High Court judgment stated the decision of the board to suspend Burke followed him interrupting a religious service and asserting that the principal had made a “demand” that staff accept “transgenderism”.
Burke said this was against his beliefs and the teaching of all Christian churches.
The judgment, describing Burke as “agitated”, said he also interrupted the school principal while she was socialising with guests on two occasions after the service.
He was put on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of a disciplinary process, but continued showing up to the school, leading to the school asking the High Court for an injunction order to prevent him from attending.
The court granted a temporary injunction, however this didn’t stop Burke and he was jailed in September 2022 for breaching the order.
He spent three months in a Dublin jail before being released in December 2022.
He was then formally dismissed from his job in January 2023, and faced a fine of 700 euros (A$1,150) per day if he returned to the school.
He reappeared as the new term began, and went on to amass more than 140,000 euros (A$230,700) in fines for breaching court orders and was jailed for a second time in September 2023 after he refused to promise the court that he would stay away from the school.
He was released during school holidays in June 2024, but went to the school again in August when the term commenced.
Wilson’s Hospital School applied for an order to jail Burke on August 28 for failing to comply with a permanent injunction to not trespass on the school grounds.
On September 2, a judge jailed Burke for the third time.
The Courts Service of Ireland confirmed to AAP FactCheck that Burke was committed to prison for breaching an order that he stay away from the school.
Dr Charles O’Mahony, a law lecturer at the University of Galway, also told AAP FactCheck the claim is not true.
“[Burke] was imprisoned for refusing to comply with orders of the Irish High Court,” Dr O’Mahony said.
He said there’s no provision in Irish law to arrest a person for not endorsing “transgender ideology” or for “not calling a boy a girl”.
He added that the Irish government is currently developing new hate speech and hate crime laws, but said the current draft if enacted would still not provide for the arrest of a person for the reasons claimed.

5533,fake,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-03-08,"Remix News reported that members of the Ukrainian Air Force (PS-ZSU) used the Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range (HAMMER) bomb to attack Russian troops. Sources from both sides of the battle lines confirmed the deployment of the laser-guided HAMMER bomb on March 5.
Drone footage released by the Ukrainian military showed the precision-guided munition hitting Russian positions in the town of Kozachi Laheri in southern Ukraine on March 4. It featured the bomb with the phrases ""for the children of Odesa"" and ""with hatred and no respect"" written in the Ukrainian language.
Voennii Osvedomitel, a pro-Russian military information channel on the Telegram messaging app, also confirmed the attack. It added that a MiG-29 aircraft from the PS-ZSU dropped the bomb. The HAMMER guidance kit was attached to a 250-kilogram bomb.
The guidance kit is manufactured by Safran Electronics and Defense, which is based in France's Boulogne-Billancourt township. It attaches mobile wings, a rocket motor, advanced navigation and targeting electronics to a ""dumb"" unguided aerial bomb – turning it into a precision-guided aerial explosive.
The HAMMER kit, which is similar to the U.S.-made Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), is even more accurate when laser guidance is used. According to Remix News, ""the weapon is rated to reliably hit a square meter target at distances of over 70 kilometers (43.5 miles).""
Meanwhile, French defense magazine A&C confirmed that the strike had taken place. It added that French and Ukrainian engineers had collaborated to adapt the HAMMER bomb for use from a Soviet-era attack aircraft. While A&C did not specify the type of aircraft used in the March 4 Kozachi Laheri attack, the Russian Telegram channel identified it as the MiG-29.

In January 2024, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that Paris would deliver 50 HAMMER systems to Kyiv monthly. The next month, French Armed Forces Minister Sebastien Lecornu said the PS-ZSU's MiG-29 jets and frontline Su-24 bombers would be adapted to carry the munitions. (Related: France promises to supply Ukraine with long-range cruise missiles, putting a target on itself for Russia’s nuclear weapons.)
The PS-ZSU's March 4 attack on Russian positions followed an earlier drone attack launched by Russia. Moscow reportedly launched Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa, facing the black sea. According to Al Jazeera, a total of 17 drones were launched.
One of the Shahed drones struck an apartment block and exploded, causing the deaths of 12 people including five children. Two of the five juvenile casualties were babies. ""Rescuers in Odesa have just uncovered the bodies of a mother with a three-month-old baby,"" Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said in a March 2 post on Telegram.
The Shahed drones manufactured by Iran ""do not return to base after an attack,"" Al Jazeera explained. ""These 'kamikaze' drones carry explosives, dive toward a target and explode on impact. Russia has launched several thousands of these long-range winged drones throughout the war at targets deep inside Ukraine.""
In the aftermath of the Odesa drone attack, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated his calls for the West to provide Kyiv with more air defense systems against these drones.
""We need more air defenses from our partners,"" he said. ""We need to strengthen the Ukrainian air shield to add more protection for our people from Russian terror. More air defense systems and more missiles for air defense systems save lives.""

The latest draft of the Pandemic Treaty proposed by WHO’s Intergovernmental Negotiating Body is an admission of failure so significant that they are suggesting nations sign an incomplete document.
“They know that they cannot show us the details of what they really want to do. So, they are proposing an incomplete, watered-down agreement in the hopes that they will be able to make decisions in the future; in the hopes that we won’t be paying attention,” James Roguski has concluded.
Let’s not lose touch…Your Government and Big Tech are actively trying to censor the information reported by The Exposé to serve their own needs. Subscribe now to make sure you receive the latest uncensored news in your inbox…
Please note: WHO’s Pandemic Treaty has also been referred to as the Pandemic Accord, Pandemic Agreement and WHO Convention Agreement + (“WHO CA+”). In this article, we refer to it as the Pandemic Agreement.
The ninth meeting of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (“INB”) started on 18 March and ended on 28 March. “WHO Member States agreed to resume negotiations aimed at finalising a pandemic agreement during 29 April to 10 May” at the resumption of INB9, a statement released by the World Health Organisation (“WHO”) said.
In December 2021 WHO decided to establish the INB to draft and negotiate a WHO convention, agreement, or other international instrument on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response. INB9 is the ninth meeting of the INB.
The next round of INB9 negotiations will end a little over two weeks before the World Health Assembly.
“Next month’s resumption of INB9 will be a critical milestone ahead of the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly, starting 27 May 2024, at which Member States are scheduled to consider the proposed text of the world’s first pandemic agreement for adoption,” WHO’s statement said.
WHO’s statement includes a link to a draft of the Pandemic Agreement that INB9 was negotiating. This version is labelled A/INB/9/3 and is dated 13 March 2024.
Related: WHO’s Pandemic Treaty negotiations are going very badly
In an article posted on Thursday, James Roguski highlighted some serious issues with a more recent version of WHO’s proposed Pandemic Agreement which is labelled A/INB/9R/3 and dated April 2024.
His article titled ‘Bullsh*t’ includes a 5-minute video and written explanation of the issues in the latest draft, as well as a copy of the draft that can be downloaded. You can find his article HERE.
Below we have picked up some of the issues Roguski has alerted us to and fleshed them out to give them some context.
Proposal for the WHO Pandemic Agreement (A/INB/9R/3)
The newly released draft of the proposed Pandemic Agreement begins: “The Parties to the WHO Pandemic Agreement … have agreed as follows …”
As defined in the draft, “Party” means a State or regional economic integration organisation that has consented to be bound by this Pandemic Agreement.
According to the draft Agreement, a “regional economic integration organisation” means “an organisation that is composed of several sovereign states and to which its Member States have transferred competence over a range of matters, including the authority to make decisions binding on its Member States in respect of those matters.”
Although it’s not stipulated which regional economic integration organisations WHO selects to participate in its decision-making – concurrently affecting the lives of people living in several countries – a list of regional economic integration organisations the United Nations collaborates with and supports includes:
- African Union (AU)
- Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
- Arab League (AL)
- Arab Maghreb Union (AMU)
- Caribbean Community (CARICOM)
- Council of Europe (CoE)
- Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU)
- European Union (EU)
- South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)
- Shanghai Cooperation Organisation
- Asian-African Legal Consultative Organisation (AALCO)
- Union for the Mediterranean (UfM)
- Union of South American Nations (USAN)
Article 5
Article 5 of the draft is titled ‘One Health’.
The draft Agreement defines the One Health approach as an “integrated, unifying approach that aims to sustainably balance and optimize the health of people, animals and ecosystems. It recognises that the health of humans, domestic and wild animals, plants and the wider environment (including ecosystems) is closely linked and interdependent.”
According to Article 5, the Parties that sign up to the draft pledge to promote a collaborative One Health approach to prevent and respond to pandemics, recognising the interconnectedness of people, animals, and the environment.
The Parties commit to addressing the root causes of pandemics and integrating interventions into pandemic prevention plans.
Each Party pledges to protect human, animal, and plant health by implementing national policies reflecting a One Health approach, involving communities in policy development and response, and promoting or establishing One Health joint training programs and continuing education programmes for human, animal and environmental health workforces.
Here’s the problem. The Parties who sign this document pledge to go along with a One Health approach for which the details will be defined at a later stage and finalised up to two years after they sign it:
4. The modalities, terms and conditions, and operational dimensions of a One Health approach shall be further defined in an instrument, that takes into consideration the provisions of the IHR (2005), and is operational by 31 May 2026. [Emphasis added]Proposal for the WHO Pandemic Agreement (A/INB/9R/3), World Health Organisation, April 2024
In other words, Parties that adopt this agreement in May are giving WHO carte blanche regarding people, domestic and wild animals, plants and the wider environment (including ecosystems).
Article 12 has the same problem.
Article 12
Article 12 is titled ‘Access and benefit sharing’. This article deals with the establishment of a “PABS system” to ensure rapid, systematic and timely sharing of PABS Material and Information.
The draft defines “PABS Material and Information” to mean “the biological material from a pathogen with pandemic potential, as well as sequence information relevant to the development of pandemic-related health products.”
And, a “pathogen with pandemic potential” is defined as “any pathogen that has been identified to infect a human and that is: novel (not yet characterised) or known (including a variant of a known pathogen), potentially highly transmissible and/or highly virulent with the potential to cause a public health emergency of international concern.”
According to Article 12, Parties who agree to the draft agree that WHO will coordinate and convene the PABS System.
The PABS System will be built upon the commitment of parties to share pathogens and their benefits equally, without stifling research and innovation. It will also be designed to complement the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework and adhere to biosafety, biosecurity and data protection standards. Intellectual property rights will not be sought on PABS materials and information.
The key components of WHO’s PABS System will include the rapid and systematic sharing of PABS materials and information, as well as the fair and timely sharing of benefits. During a pandemic, WHO will have access to 20% of safe and effective pandemic-related health products. Monetary contributions from PABS System users will be administered by WHO. A mechanism will be developed to allocate and distribute pandemic-related health products based on public health risks, needs, and demand.
The draft WHO Pandemic Agreement defines “pandemic-related health products” as “safe, effective, quality and affordable products that are needed for pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, which may include, without limitation, diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines and personal protective equipment.”
Article 12 also states that laboratories in WHO’s network will be encouraged to involve scientists from developing countries in research projects related to PABS materials and information. Parties with manufacturing facilities for pandemic-related health products are expected to facilitate their export according to agreed timetables between WHO and manufacturers.
However, as with Article 5, the Parties who sign this document pledge to go along with WHO’s PAB System without knowing the specific details of what will be imposed on them:
6. The modalities, terms and conditions, and operational dimensions of the PABS System shall be further defined in a legally-binding instrument, that is operational no later than 31 May 2026. [Emphasis added]Proposal for the WHO Pandemic Agreement (A/INB/9R/3), World Health Organisation, April 2024
Similarly, Article 6 also has gaping holes and presents problems regarding a lack of transparency and accountability.
Article 6
Article 6 has the title ‘Preparedness, readiness and health system resilience’.
According to this Article, the Parties who sign the document agree to develop and maintain a resilient health system, with a focus on primary care, to prevent and respond to pandemics. Each Party will strengthen their health system functions and infrastructure, including providing timely and equitable access to quality healthcare during pandemics, with a particular focus on vulnerable populations.
They will also promote post-pandemic health system recovery, enhance laboratory and diagnostic capacities, and use social and behavioural sciences for pandemic prevention.
The Parties will collaborate with WHO to establish international data standards for sharing public health data.
Additionally, a monitoring and evaluation system “shall be developed, implemented and regularly assessed by WHO in partnership with relevant organisations, building on relevant tools, on a timeline to be agreed by the Conference of the Parties.”
The Conference of the Parties (“COP”) has not yet been established. It will be established with the adoption of the Pandemic Agreement. Article 21 of the draft states: “A Conference of the Parties is hereby established.”
Usually, a COP is composed of representatives of the member states of a convention and accredited observers.
There is no indication in the draft Pandemic Agreement of which representatives or observers, or how many, will make up the COP. So Parties that sign the draft Pandemic Agreement are agreeing to implement a monitoring and evaluation system devised by unknown people in an unknown timeline.
To add insult to injury, the proposed Pandemic Agreement gives WHO, literally, an open chequebook.
According to Article 21: “The Conference of the Parties shall by consensus adopt financial rules for itself as well as governing the funding of any subsidiary bodies it may establish as well as financial provisions governing the functioning of the Secretariat.”
And, “The Conference of the Parties may establish subsidiary bodies, as it deems necessary, and determine the terms and modalities of such bodies.”

6183,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-11-06,"Algeria condemns 'baseless' Imane Khelif medical leakNovember 6, 2024
The Algerian Olympic Committee (COA) has criticized the ""ongoing and baseless attacks"" on Imane Khelif, after an unverified leaked medical assessment allegedly showed the Paris Olympic boxing gold medalist as having internal testes and no uterus.
""These attacks, often based on unsubstantiated allegations, aim to tarnish the image of an athlete who has brought honor to our nation on the international stage,"" the COA told DW in a statement. ""We firmly condemn these attempts at destabilization, which have no place in the world of sports.""
Meanwhile, Jacques Young, an endocrinologist at Bicetre Hospital in Paris who reportedly co-authored the assessment, has suggested to DW that his name was being used to spread false information and an anti-trans agenda.
The hospital wouldn't confirm the authenticity of the assessment, telling DW that it ""does not provide any information relating to medical confidentiality and, in particular, does not specify whether a person has consulted a doctor or not.""
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) wouldn't comment on ""unverified documents whose origin cannot be confirmed,"" but said it understood that Khelif was ""preparing a lawsuit in response to the latest reporting.""
The assessment, which is said to have been written in June 2023, has been widely shared by media outlets and on social media, including by Riley Gaines and Sharron Davies, two former swimmers who have been vocal against transgender women being allowed to compete in the female category.
""These claims, which have persisted for several months, are entirely unfounded and contradict the values and principles of the Olympic movement,"" the COA said.
Continued controversy and criticism
Algeria's Khelif, who won gold in the women's 66-kilogram category, was at the center of controversy throughout the Games after the International Boxing Association (IBA) accused her of twice failing unspecified gender tests at its world championships in 2022 and 2023.
Those tests allegedly revealed that Khelif possesses XY (male) chromosomes, although the IBA failed to provide any substantial evidence to support its claims. The IOC, which ran the boxing competition in Paris because of the IBA's suspension from the Olympics, said at the time that the tests were ""not legitimate.""
Anti-trans agenda?
The hysteria surrounding Khelif has continued long after the end of the Olympics. The Algerian was targeted by online abuse and one of boxing's professional bodies, the WBO, put out a statement last month denying reports that it had banned the 25-year-old fighter and stripped her of her gold medal — something it would never have the power to do.
The latest claims originated in France on October 25, but gained traction on social media in early November 2024, when they were picked up by Reduxx, an online magazine that labels itself as ""pro woman"" and ""anti-bullsh*t.""
Purportedly based on a leaked medical assessment authored by Young and an Algerian endocrinologist, Soumaya Fedala, the original report on a little-known French website detailed how Khelif allegedly underwent an MRI scan and genetic testing, which supposedly revealed that she has an XY difference of sexual development (DSD). Women with some DSDs are often wrongly conflated with transgender women.
A screenshot from the assessment, which was glossed over in the original French report, showed that the doctors, Young and Fedala, judged Khelif to be female. ""In view of the clinical history ... the female sex is always favored,"" the screenshot read.
When it was put to Young that his name was potentially being used to legitimize false information and further an anti-trans agenda, he told DW: ""I think your statement perfectly reflects reality.""
Khelif, who has never identified as anything other than a woman, has been approached for comment via her manager.

6022,fake,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-04-11,"04/11/2024 / By Lance D Johnson
Once considered “conspiracy” theory” by the entire corporate media, geoengineering is now being lauded as the solution for climate change. For years, the media was used to gaslight the public about this reality and coverup this mass experimentation in the skies. These geoengineering experiments are conducted without human consent, and they adversely affect the environment, the weather and human health.
One of the most important developments lately, in this fight for the future of humanity, is a new law in Tennessee that blocks geoengineering across the state. If word gets out about people protecting themselves from these chemtrails, then the entire U.S. might become a no-fly zone for weather modification schemes and the intentional spraying and dumping of toxins and chemicals onto the people, the cities and countryside. The Mexican government became aware of these schemes and banned the large scale experiments immediately.
Now that the public is becoming more aware of the existence of these unethical experiments, the corporate media is being used to promote these geoengineering schemes as if they are a new thing that will save the planet from global warming.
A new report from San Francisco, California claims that the U.S. is conducting its “first outdoor test to limit global warming.” The project is derived from a controversial field of research known as solar radiation modification. These schemes, financed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, require aerosols to be shot into the stratosphere, where the particles allegedly reflect sunlight away from the Earth. But how do these microscopic salt particles affect the ecosystem?
Human knowledge is under attack! Governments and powerful corporations are using censorship to wipe out humanity's knowledge base about nutrition, herbs, self-reliance, natural immunity, food production, preparedness and much more. We are preserving human knowledge using AI technology while building the infrastructure of human freedom. Speak freely without censorship at the new decentralized, blockchain-power Brighteon.io.

A decommissioned aircraft carrier, equipped with the aerosol injections, was launched out of the San Francisco Bay at the end of March 2024. The aircraft is equipped with specially designed sprayers that can shoot trillions of sea salt particles into the sky. The experiment allegedly seeks to increase the density and capacity of marine clouds to reduce solar radiation in the region. The operation increases cloud cover over the region, artificially blocking out the sun, and making the population susceptible to unknown experimental particles that will inevitably rain down over the land.
This is all part of an unethical project led by researchers at the University of Washington. The project is called CAARE, which stands for The Coastal Atmospheric Aerosol Research and Engagement. The experiments are scheduled to run through April and May. The area affected includes the skies surrounding the USS Hornet Sea, Air and Space Museum in Alameda, California.
The secrecy surrounding these projects is beginning to unwind, as criminal conspiracies become more transparent. Going forward, these conspiracies will be sold to the public under a guise of benevolence and scientific achievement.
“Since this experiment was kept under wraps until the test started, we are eager to see how public engagement is being planned and who will be involved,” said Shuchi Talati, the executive director of the Alliance for Just Deliberation on Solar Geoengineering, a nonprofit that seeks to include developing countries in decisions about geoengineering.
“While it complies with all current regulatory requirements, there is a clear need to reexamine what a strong regulatory framework must look like in a world where [solar radiation modification] experimentation is happening,” she added.
A similar project authored by Harvard University sought to use the skies over Sweden as testing grounds for reflective aerosols. The project was halted after indigenous groups pushed back. By blocking out the sun, weather patterns can be altered for millions of people in unknown ways. Artificial cloud seeding can have ripple effects for the entire world.
Man-made climate change is not the most pressing problem. Globalist-funded geoengineering schemes and large-scale intervention in the skies could greatly impact our weather and climate, causing unforeseen problems for farmers, fisheries and ecosystems, among many other environmental and human health impacts.

5213,fake,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-11-04,"11/04/2024 / By Lance D Johnson
When flu cases and flu deaths magically disappeared during the covid-19 scamdemic, it became clear that the narratives around sickness, disease, treatment, vaccines and immunity were being manipulated to control the population. Pharmaceutical narratives surrounding the flu have been grossly misleading for decades.
A new research report by Rhoda Wilson at the Expose finds influenza to be a rare infectious disease. According to more than 50 years of data, published in the Cochrane Reviews, around 97.5% of symptoms traditionally attributed to the flu are not caused by influenza, and the fatality rate is virtually nonexistent. These findings are based on the work of Dr. Tom Jefferson, a prominent figure in the world of evidence-based medicine. His work has been gaining attention for his ongoing series of articles titled “The Dot Series,” on the Substack page “Trust the Evidence.” The project originally aimed to share insights from Jefferson and his colleagues regarding influenza vaccines but has since evolved into a critical examination of four Cochrane reviews that highlight the poor performance of these vaccines.
Jefferson’s research flies in the face of mortality data provided by official government sources. The World Health Organization (WHO) claims that seasonal influenza kills up to 650,000 people annually. So, why has the flu label been traditionally attributed to these deaths around the world, and what is actually driving the mortality? Is flu being intentionally exaggerated to coerce populations to take products (seasonal flu vaccines) that are marketed as the preventative cure? If these products were the cure, why hasn’t “influenza” and all the associated symptoms and cases of illness been eradicated? How many flu vaccines must a person take to feel safe from this disease?
Dr. Jefferson’s reflections trace back to the mid-1990s, when he began working with the Cochrane Collaboration to establish protocols for reviewing influenza vaccines. His commitment to rigorously analyzing randomized controlled trials led to the realization that much of the perceived threat of influenza was exaggerated. Jefferson notes, “In the healthy adult’s review, the placebo arm picked up 465 cases out of 18,593 participants. So, of the folks with symptoms, 97.5% were not caused by influenza.”
His findings challenge the prevailing narrative promoted by health authorities, which often present dire statistics regarding flu-related deaths and hospitalizations. Jefferson concludes, “Complications were very rare; for deaths, we found zilch — not the figures put forward by the CDC.” He also accuses U.S. authorities of knowing about the fraud of influenza, saying they “bent over backwards to defend each other and cover up the scam.” According to his research, novel changes to influenza A and B are uncommon, making the virus rare and slow moving. For these reasons, he suggests, “Population interventions such as inactivated vaccines do not stand a chance against a relatively rare moving target like influenza.”
His research, encapsulated in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials, gives a clearer picture of influenza incidence (indicated by antibody titers and/or viral positive culture isolates). The dataset includes observed and recorded cases at the height of the “winter influenza season.” From the dataset of 18,593 participants, the placebo arm showed 465 symptoms of influenza, even though they weren’t infected with influenza in any measurable way. It turns out that there are multiple infective and non-infective agents that cause the same signs and symptoms as influenza.
This fraudulent correlation helps explain why these same signs and symptoms were not called influenza during the covid-19 hysteria, and were instead labeled something completely new – COVID-19. Medical authorities are pressured to label universal signs and symptoms of illness as “flu” or “COVID-19” – depending on which disease is being marketed at the time. This is because there is always a new vaccine that is being marketed to advance the perpetual fraud. However, these vaccines only strain human immune systems, without taking into consideration the reasons why they present symptoms of disease in the first place. Flu vaccines are notoriously generated with antigens that do not match the various infectious bacterial and viral threats that take advantage of human immune systems every year.
Furthermore, no trials across 50 years of data were able to detect deaths from influenza, and hospitalizations were relatively rare. So-called flu hospitalizations could be a mixture of many different underlying chronic diseases, inflammatory responses to various unknown agents, and/or the detoxification processes of the cells. These “flu” cases could very easily be the result of a weakened immune system that is overtaxed by sugars and endocrine disrupting chemicals. Various toxic vectors, including all the antibiotics and vaccines that a person takes, prompt an acidic environment to express disease.
It’s time to take an objective look at the poisons – especially the vaccines – that are the underlying reason for people’s signs and symptoms of “influenza” and “covid.” Immunosuppression begins, not with a specific marketable virus, but instead with all the damage that is inflicted on the individual’s microbiome and cellular terrain. Malnutrition sets people up for disease. The drugs that destroy the microbiome are the precursor to these symptoms of “influenza.”
The medical literature is begging us to question the flu vaccine campaigns and take a different approach to understanding the signs and symptoms that are so readily attributed to influenza. For more on the issue:

American troops might be used as guinea pigs for a lab-grown meat initiative funded by the Department of Defense (DoD), ostensibly to cut down on carbon dioxide emissions at military bases.
The Washington Free Beacon reported that BioMADE, a public-private partnership that has received more than $500 million from the DoD, is responsible for the endeavor. BioMADE announced on its website on June 3 that it is looking for new ideas to reduce the CO2 emissions from food production and transport at military sites. These ideas include “novel cell culture methods suitable for the production of cultivated meat or protein” – essentially a euphemism for lab-grown fake meat.
Lab-grown meat is a new technology where animal muscle and fat tissues are grown from modified animal cells in special equipment. This process uses a mix of chemicals, pressure and temperature to create meat that resembles beef, chicken and pork. Though still in the experimental stage, lab-grown meat has sparked a debate about its efficiency and ethics of producing meat without killing animals. (Related: Lab-made chicken meat grown from CANCER CELLS receives FDA approval – Are you ready to eat TUMOR nuggets?)
But according to a 2023 study by researchers at the University of California-Davis, the carbon footprint of lab-grown beef might be worse than that of the product it seeks to replace. It zoomed in on the use of highly refined or purified growth media, which is used to help animal cells multiply. They wrote that lab-grown meat using purified media in its production has a global warming potential four to 25 times greater than the average compared to the real thing.

Critics argue that using U.S. troops to test lab-grown meat, which is still experimental and not widely available in stores, is inappropriate. Although the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved two California companies to sell cultured chicken to restaurants in 2023, some believe taxpayer money shouldn’t fund the lab-grown meat industry.
Jack Hubbard, executive director for the Center for the Environment and Welfare (CEW), was among the vocal critics of the plan. “Taxpayer dollars should not be used to fund the lab-grown meat sector,” he remarked.
“Our troops deserve better than to be served lab-grown meat, produced in bioreactors with immortalized cells and chemicals. Unfortunately, this effort is being driven by an agenda that is political and anti-farmer. Our soldiers should never be used as guinea pigs.”
Even Ethan Lane, vice president for government affairs at the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, has criticized the DoD research grant that bankrolled BioMADE.
“It is outrageous that the DoD is spending millions of taxpayer dollars to feed our heroes like lab rats,” he said in a statement. “This misguided research project is a giant slap in the face to everyone that has served our country. Our veterans and active-duty troops deserve so much better than this.”
“U.S. cattle producers raise the highest-quality beef in the world, with the lowest carbon footprint – and American troops deserve to be served that same wholesome, natural meat and not ultra-processed, lab-grown protein that is cooked up in a chemical-filled bioreactor.”

2197,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-05-01,"Drone footage shows devastation in Ukraine’s strategic eastern city of Chasiv Yar as Russians near
Fourteen people were injured after a Russian ballistic missile slammed into the Ukrainian city of Odesa late Wednesday, the State Emergency Service reported. Videos shared by the Emergency Service showed huge plumes of smoke rising skywards at the site.
KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Months of relentless Russian artillery pounding have devastated a strategic city in eastern Ukraine, new drone footage obtained by The Associated Press shows, with barely a building left intact, homes and municipal offices charred and a town that once had a population of 12,000 now all but deserted.
The footage shows Chasiv Yar — set amid green fields and woodland — pounded into an apocalyptic vista. The destruction is reminiscent of the cities of Bakhmut and Avdiivka, which Ukraine yielded after months of bombardment and huge losses for both sides.
The strategically important city has been under attack by Russian forces for months. Capturing it would give Russia control of a hilltop from which it can attack other cities that form the backbone of Ukraine’s eastern defenses.
That would set the stage for a potentially broader Russian offensive that Ukrainian officials say could come as early as this month.
Russia launched waves of assaults on foot and in armored vehicles at Chasiv Yar’s outnumbered Ukrainian troops, who have run desperately short of ammunition while waiting for the U.S. and other allies to send fresh supplies.
Rows of mid-rise apartment blocks in Chasiv Yar have been blackened by blasts, punched through with holes or reduced to piles of timber and masonry. Houses and civic buildings are heavily damaged. The golden dome of a church remains intact but the building appears badly damaged.
No soldiers or civilians were seen in the footage shot Monday and exclusively obtained by the AP, apart from a lone man walking down the middle of a road between wrecked structures.
Regional Gov. Vadym Filashkin said Wednesday on Ukrainian TV that 682 residents have held on in Chasiv Yar, living in “very difficult conditions.” The city had a pre-war population of over 12,500. Filashkin said that those remaining have lacked running water and power for over a year, and that it is “ever more difficult” for humanitarian aid to reach them.
The destruction underscores Russia’s scorched-earth tactics throughout more than two years of war, as its troops have killed and displaced thousands of civilians.
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg acknowledged Monday that the delayed delivery of allies’ military aid to Ukraine had left the country at the mercy of the Kremlin’s bigger and better-equipped forces.
Ukraine and its Western partners are racing to deploy critical new military aid that can help check the slow but steady Russian advance as well as thwart drone and missile attacks.
Elsewhere, Ukrainian authorities reported that two civilians died and at least nine others, included an 11-year-old boy, were wounded Wednesday after Russian aerial guided bombs pummeled a village in the northeastern Kharkiv region.
According to Gov. Oleh Syniehubov, a 64-year-old man and 38-year-old woman - both locals - were killed after one of the bombs detonated near their car in Zolochiv, some 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the border with Russia.
In the southern Black Sea port of Odesa, at least 13 people were injured after a Russian ballistic missile slammed into the city late Wednesday, regional Gov. Oleh Kiper said in a Telegram update. He did not say what had been hit, but reported the blast had sparked a major fire.
Videos circulating on social media showed huge plumes of smoke rising skywards at the site. Nova Poshta, a large Ukrainian postal and courier company, said in a Facebook post Wednesday that one of its sorting depots had been struck, but claimed no employees were among those hurt.
Odesa has been a frequent target for Russian firepower, with eight civilians killed by Russian missiles in the city over the past two days.

Previous waves of censorship have hit the “Online Right” particularly hard such as the 2017 backlash to the Trump presidency and the covid saga.
As the war drum beats ever louder, we must remember that war and threats to national security are permanent states of exception that a regime can use to ram through all manner of draconian laws and limits to free expression. So, it’s important to prepare for what comes next instead of only reacting after the fact.
Previous episodes of censorship may have acted as a filtering process. Thanks in large part to covid, “the Regime” has the technical and regulatory frameworks to cancel people. We can also thank the pandemic for allowing the Regime to know who is and is not susceptible to trusting their narrative. Rest assured, the list of dissenters has already been drafted and names noted of the rotten apples that must be tossed out of the barrel.
In an essay, Morgoth explores a hypothetical scenario where “the Regime” can claim that those naysaying the “war effort” are a danger to national security and can therefore be dealt with accordingly. The essay explores the options facing the Online Right, dissenters who speak out online, in an era of heightened geopolitical tension and national security risks.
Let’s not lose touch…Your Government and Big Tech are actively trying to censor the information reported by The Exposé to serve their own needs. Subscribe now to make sure you receive the latest uncensored news in your inbox…
The following is a summary of the thought-provoking essay ‘The Online Right’s Kobayashi Maru Test’ by Morgoth. We encourage you to read the full essay which can be found HERE.
The recent interview between Tucker Carlson and Vladimir Putin drew criticism from Western elites, who labelled Carlson a traitor and a useful idiot. Many commentators mocked the notion of betrayal, pointing out the influence of financial interests on these elites. However, as the geopolitical climate worsens, there is a growing concern about what happens when politicians view dissenters as traitors.
During times of war, regimes can enact draconian laws and limit free expression in the name of national security. This threat is compounded by the increasing censorship regulations being rolled out in many countries, allowing governments to censor online content.
By sheer coincidence, all across the Five-Eyes nations bloated regulation charters are currently being rolled out to ensure that governments can censor whomever they wish online. In Britain, an example of such regulation is the Online Harms Bill. In the European Union, it’s called the Digital Services Act, and in Australia the Australian Communications and Media Authority. America is still relatively free of overt state censorship but that is small recompense when private corporations will happily oblige in gagging the populace on behalf of the intelligence bureaucracy.
While the Online Right, a loosely connected group of commentators, opposes the ruling regime, they may find themselves on the wrong side of power during a crisis.
Choosing to oppose the regime during a time of war could be seen as a danger to national security, and influencers who reach a large audience may face particular scrutiny. In this delicate scenario, it becomes difficult to maintain neutrality or support for the regime, and dissenters risk being labelled as threats. The pandemic has allowed the regime to identify those who are susceptible to their narrative, further enabling them to control and censor dissenting voices.
As tensions escalate, the rhetoric becomes more extreme, and dissenters may face a Kobayashi Maru scenario (a term borrowed from ‘Star Trek: Wrath of Khan’), where their options appear limited.
A few responses by the Online Right to this scenario emerge: aligning with external enemies against the Western regime; hoping for internal changes through destabilisation, keeping a low profile to avoid suspicion, or reluctantly supporting the regime out of loyalty to the military.
Morgoth describes these responses under the headings: Third Worldist, Destabiliser Enjoyer, Keep Your Head Down and The Reluctant Shill.
However, regardless of the chosen stance, the regime will capitalise on the conflict to crush its internal enemies and justify its actions in the name of national security.
This new era of censorship has already impacted the Online Right, with previous waves of censorship silencing many voices.
It is, therefore, crucial to anticipate and prepare for the future rather than reactively respond to the repeated suppression of dissent.

6178,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-10-28,"How China-Taiwan same-sex marriages get caught in politicsOctober 28, 2024
This year's Taiwan Pride Parade, which drew over 180,000 participants to Taipei on Saturday, holds special meaning for Ryan.
Two weeks ago, the 38-year-old from Taiwan and his Chinese partner, Righ, became the first cross-strait, same-sex couple to have their partnership legally recognized.
""It's like a dream. I keep asking myself, is this real?"" Righ told DW in an online interview from Beijing. The couple spoke using pseudonyms out of safety concerns as gay marriage is illegal in China.
Taiwan became the first place in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage in 2019.
Last year, authorities extended these rights, allowing foreigners from countries that do not recognize same-sex couples to marry their Taiwanese partners on the island.
However, due to political and security concerns, same-sex couples from China and Taiwan were excluded from these rights until September, when that restriction was lifted.
Long legal battle
Despite the geopolitical tensions across the Taiwan Strait, Ryan and Righ have been in a long-distance relationship for eight years.
Their story began in the summer of 2016 when Ryan, who runs a B&B in Taiwan, met Righ, who was visiting as a tourist.
The couple decided to register their marriage in the United States in 2019. They then applied for a family reunion visa in Taiwan, hoping that Righ could live on the island as Ryan's spouse.
But the request was repeatedly denied by the Taiwanese immigration authorities. The couple struggled with appeals and lawsuits for four years.
In August, they won an unexpected victory.
The court ruled in their favor, affirming that cross-strait, same-sex couples who were married in a third country should be treated the same as heterosexual couples, allowing them to reunite in Taiwan and apply for residency.
A month later, the government approved China-Taiwan same-sex couples for marriage registrations based on their marriage record in a third country.
""I used to see him [Righ] as a soldier on a mission or a crew member on a long voyage who can only come back once or twice a year,"" Ryan told DW.
""That was how I kept our relationship going, to avoid the pain of constantly facing the separation under the policy. Finally, we can fully devote ourselves to this relationship,"" Ryan said.
He and Righ have started discussing their future plans, including Righ applying for dependent residency in Taiwan.
""This is the first page of our new beginning. After eight years, we're just now facing challenges that others encounter on day one.""
Cross-strait tensions
Chien Chih-chieh, the Secretary General of the Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights (TAPCPR) who has been campaigning for Ryan and Right's legal case, highlighted the role of cross-strait political tensions, which have intensified in recent years.
""Our struggle for cross-strait same-sex marriage is not only about resisting homophobia ... the battle is also about cross-strait relations,"" she told DW.
""While we can try to show the government that Taiwanese society increasingly supports same-sex marriage, we can't control cross-strait relations.""
Although the Taiwanese government loosening the rules represents a major ""milestone"" given the political tensions, Chien said the current legal framework could create a financial barrier and lead to class disparities.
""The requirement to marry in a third country, frankly, doesn't enhance national security controls or address existing vulnerabilities. Why? Because those with financial means can easily meet the criteria,"" she said.
On the day the restrictions were lifted, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Deputy Minister Liang Wen-chieh said that ""to prevent fake cross-border marriages and avoid security issues, Taiwan has always required cross-strait couples to marry abroad before coming to Taiwan for marriage registration based on an interview.""
But Chien pointed out that, the Taiwanese government allows foreigners from certain countries where same-sex marriage is illegal to apply for entry into Taiwan and is willing to conduct interviews for security checks.
If they pass the interview, they can then get married in Taiwan.
""I believe this is more equitable, but the MAC is unwilling to offer the same policy for cross-strait couples,"" Chien said.
""To ensure that more people from China have the opportunity to come to Taiwan amid the current cross-strait tensions, I believe this puts significant pressure on the MAC,"" she added.
Concerns over Chinese spies infiltrating Taiwan through same-sex marriage frustrate Ryan.
""If I were to fake a marriage today, why not do it the traditional way with a heterosexual couple? If it's two men or two women, it would draw even more scrutiny. I feel that often, the rights of minorities are subject to heightened examination.""
""It's like Romeo and Juliet,"" Ryan said, describing his relationship with Righ.
""The two families might be enemies, and when their leaders are in conflict, the children can't do anything about it. For us, we fell in love, and that's not something we can control.""
‘Major step forward'
The political tensions between China and Taiwan also manifest in day-to-day interactions between cross-strait, same-sex couples.
""When we first met, we were cautious, feeling a barrier between us and afraid to cross any boundaries,"" Judy, a Taiwanese photographer working in London, recalled her early conversations on cross-strait issues with her Chinese partner Lisa.
While they're not planning to marry yet, both are excited about the Taiwanese government's move.
""This is a major step forward for Taiwan's LGBTQ+ movement,"" Lisa told DW, adding that it provides ""cross-strait couples who wish to marry with more options.""
Righ and Ryan can now start to build their future together, free from the constraints imposed on them by the political situation in their homelands.
""Our relationship is definitely not a reflection of cross-strait relations. Those are quite delicate, but our relationship is stable,"" said Righ. ""We just want to take care of each other and be together for the rest of our lives.""

5959,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-06-20,"The biggest ever public survey on climate change shows widespread support for stronger action.
Around 80 per cent of Italians want their country to focus on protecting and restoring nature - yet the government was among a handful to vote against the EU's landmark Nature Restoration Law on Monday.
That's just one small insight from the People’s Climate Vote, the biggest ever standalone public opinion survey on climate change, which was released today.
Respondents from around the world echoed this call for governments to do more, with 80 per cent saying they want stronger action on climate change.
An even higher number - 86 per cent - want their countries to set aside geopolitical differences and work together on issues impacting our planet. In the EU, this number rose to 92 per cent.
Covering 77 countries and 87 per cent of the world’s population, the survey was jointly carried out by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the University of Oxford in the UK.
It also asked respondents about topics like climate anxiety and the fossil-fuel phaseout. Here’s what it found.
Is the global public in favour of a fossil fuel phaseout?
The survey found that nearly three-quarters (72 per cent) of people around the world want to move away from fossil fuels quickly in favour of clean energy.
In the EU, this number rises to 77 per cent, showing widespread support for climate action, despite fears that the recent election results could stall progress of the Green Deal.
Among the major supporters of a phaseout are many of the world’s top producers of oil, coal and gas - including Nigeria and Türkiye (both 89 per cent), China (80 per cent), Germany (76 per cent), Saudi Arabia (75 per cent), Australia (69 per cent) and the US (54 per cent).
Italy also showed strong support with 89 per cent of people in favour.
Russia was the least supportive of a quick transition away from fossil fuels, with just 16 per cent of people in favour.
Only 7 per cent of people globally said their country should not transition at all.
People want stronger climate action from governments
Citizens of 20 of the world’s biggest greenhouse gas emitters believe their governments aren’t doing enough to combat climate change.
Italians showed the greatest support for stronger climate action, with 93 per cent of people voting in favour. In Iran, 88 per cent of people agreed, 85 per cent in Brazil, 77 per cent in South Africa and India, 73 per cent in China, 67 per cent in Germany, and 66 per cent in the US and Russia.
In particular, 78 per cent of people wanted their country to provide more protection from extreme weather, and 81 per cent of people said their country should do a lot to protect and restore nature.
Four-fifths of people said they wanted more climate change education in schools.
In many high-emitting countries, women were more likely to support strengthening their country’s climate commitments. This trend was seen most clearly in Germany, where 75 per cent of women voted in favour versus 58 per cent of men.
Are people worried about climate change?
Around the globe, 56 per cent of people said they think about climate change regularly - every day or week. In the world’s Least Developed Countries (LDCs), which contribute least to climate change but suffer its worst effects, this number rose to 63 per cent.
Climate anxiety is growing year on year, with 53 per cent of people saying they are more worried about climate change now than last year and 43 per cent saying extreme weather events were worse than usual this year.
Across the nine Small Island Developing States (SIDS) surveyed - including Vanuatu, which is at risk of becoming submerged by water by the end of the century - 71 per cent of people said they are more worried about climate change now compared to last year.
These fears are having a real world impact on many of the world’s most vulnerable people. In LDCs, 74 per cent of respondents said big decisions like where to live or work, and what to buy, were being affected by climate change.
In western and northern Europe, this figure dropped to 52 per cent, while in North America, it was 42 per cent.
The survey was a “huge scientific endeavour” that produced “some of the very highest quality global data on public opinions on climate change available,” says Professor Stephen Fisher from the University of Oxford’s Department of Sociology.
Special efforts were made to include people from marginalised groups in the poorest parts of the world, including nine countries that had never before been polled on climate change.
“These results are undeniable evidence that people everywhere support bold climate action,” says Cassie Flynn, Global Director of Climate Change for UNDP. She believes the survey should inform the next round of Paris Agreement commitments, set to be decided by world leaders in 2025.
“The next two years stand as one of the best chances we have as the international community to ensure that warming stays under 1.5°C,” she adds.
Through its Climate Promise initiative, UNDP aims to support policymakers in increasing their ambition on climate and executing their action plans successfully.
Key targets for 2030 include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, phasing out fossil fuels, tripling renewable energy supply and preventing deforestation."

The financial industry’s initial rush to commit to net zero carbon footprints at the 2021 COP26 summit in Glasgow has hit a reality check.
Banks that pledged to reduce financed emissions and invest billions in “green” and “sustainable” deals are re-evaluating their net zero commitments after facing the realities these drastic changes will have on their business.

A report by Bloomberg at the end of March highlighted the challenges faced by banks in meeting unrealistic climate goals while maintaining their client base.
The world’s biggest banks can’t live up to the green regulatory ideal unless they start dumping huge numbers of clients worldwide at a reckless pace and also roil economies in large swathes of the globe that primarily rely on dirty fuels. Faced with that dilemma, many lenders are quietly reeling in their climate ambitions,” Bloomberg wrote.
UBS banker, Judson Berkey, sparked controversy during a meeting in February hosted by the Financial Stability Board – a coordinator of global regulations – by arguing that banks cannot align with the ideal of green regulation due to the challenge of transitioning away from high-carbon assets.
“Banks are living and lending on planet earth, not planet NGFS,” Berkey told the group in an impassioned speech alluding to the Network for Greening the Financial System (“NGFS”), a collection of central bankers that creates model scenarios for how the energy transition may evolve.
The UBS banker’s outburst got little pushback from others in the meeting and exposed the cracks emerging in a multitrillion-dollar transition finance project. It also taps into what’s rapidly becoming one of the most contentious issues in the global banking industry. In private, senior bankers in sustainable finance divisions in London, New York, Toronto and Paris grumble about unrealistic expectations from regulators, civil society and climate activists around the industry’s role in getting the planet to net zero.
The standoff that’s brewing is setting the stage for a showdown at the heart of the environmental, social and governmental (“ESG”) movement. Banks play a crucial role in financing the transition to a greener economy but profitability remains a key factor.
Banks that made net zero commitments are now reassessing their strategies and are having second thoughts as the real-world ramifications of acting on those pledges become painfully apparent. They are finding it difficult to align with net zero goals and cutting ties with high-carbon industries.
Commitments to net-zero goals would disqualify banks from doing business in coal-dependent countries such as South Africa, Poland and Indonesia. And, not only do the commitments make it harder for banks to serve commodities clients like Glencore Plc, but even companies not always associated with heavy carbon footprints are ending up in the crosshairs such as technology company Nvidia Corp. and cosmetics giant L’Oreal SA, according to data compiled by Morningstar Inc.
Lenders are looking for ways to hold on to clients in an array of high-emitting industries spanning cement to shipping and aviation. Major banks, including Deutsche Bank, HSBC, and Bank of America are adding caveats to their restrictions on financing coal to protect their revenue. In some cases, banks are even placing the financing of coal plants under an ESG banner.
However, some global banks and investors say continued ties with coal just aren’t worth the risk.
Published on 28 March, UBS’s sustainability report referred to a “notable shift in emphasis” in climate change discussions from net zero pledges to recognising the need for a transition phase. This follows BlackRock’s Larry Fink saying he will stop using the term ESG, a string of financial heavyweights withdrew from Climate Action 100+ and lenders, including HSBC, decided to withdraw applications to get their climate goals certified by the UN-backed Science Based Targets initiative.
Bloomberg noted that as banks balance the needs of their clients against their “green” commitments, veterans of global finance say they want regulators to be honest and acknowledge that progress on climate is slow and that without the right incentives, bankers won’t play the role expected of them.

2418,real,INSTITUTIONAL_AND_MEDIA_DISTRUST_PUBLIC_INSTITUTIONS,2024-06-10,"So in the end, with a couple of alarming wobbles, the centre held. As polls predicted, the mainstream pro-EU alliance of centre-right, centre-left, liberal and Green parties in the European parliament hung on, quite comfortably, to its majority.
Europe’s national conservative and far-right forces made big gains, ending up with just under a quarter of MEPs in the 720-seat assembly – their highest tally ever. But they did not do uniformly well, and in some places fared worse than forecast.
Where they did do well, they did very well, most notably in France, where Emmanuel Macron’s humbling 15%-32% defeat by Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) pushed the French president into the huge gamble of calling a snap legislative election.
In Germany, too, despite a number of scandals including Nazi whitewashing, Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) garnered a higher percentage of the national vote (16%) than any of the three parties that make up the beleaguered coalition of the chancellor, Olaf Scholz.
These are worrying developments in the two countries that have traditionally acted as the motor that has driven the EU forward. France faces the risk of a far-right majority in parliament, while Germany’s government has been further weakened.
Brothers of Italy, led by the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, was a big winner, too, scoring 28%. But outside those big three member states – and Austria, where FPÖ, as long predicted, finished first on 26% – the hard right’s scores often underwhelmed.
Vlaams Belang underperformed in Belgium, scoring less than 14%, as did the Danish People’s party (6.4%). The Finns (7.6%) and the Sweden Democrats (13%), both of which are either in or supporting rightwing governments, disappointed.
In Poland, Law & Justice (PiS) was narrowly defeated by Donald Tusk’s Civic Coalition. Spain’s Vox failed to clear 10%, Geert Wilders’ Freedom party (PVV), winners of the last Dutch national election, wound up with three fewer seats than the Labour/Green Left Alliance, and in Hungary Viktor Orbán had his worst night in years.
Overall the results were broadly in line with expectations. “More than anything, these elections reflect developments at the national level,” said Cas Mudde, an expert in populism and the radical right at the University of Georgia.
Those developments undoubtedly included highly unpopular incumbent governments. But, said Mudde, if anything, judged against their current strength at national level across the bloc, the far right was now “underrepresented at European level”.
The elections’ main impact, consequently, is likely to be most felt in national capitals – most particularly Paris and Berlin.
In the European parliament itself, however, the centre-right European People’s party (EPP), which gained 10 MEPs, the centre-left Socialists and Democrats (S&D) and – despite losing a fifth of their seats – the liberals of Renew seem on course for more than 400 MEPs.
Adding in the Greens, which shed about a quarter of their seats but were left with more than 50, that gives the pro-European mainstream “centre” a total of about 455 MEPs – a reduced but still relatively comfortable majority in the 720-seat assembly.
Meanwhile, the combined hard right, splintered into Meloni’s national-conservative ECR, Le Pen’s far-right Identity and Democracy (ID), and assorted (thus far) non-aligned parties, including AfD and Orbán’s Fidesz, can count on perhaps 145.
Mujtaba Rahman, of the Eurasia Group consultancy, said: “Despite their gains, divisions and disorganisation among the rightwing groups will limit their impact on the EU’s political and policy agenda in the next five-year term.”
Along with other analysts, however, Rahman said that on specific issues where far-right policy positions had traction (and might align with centre-right EPP objectives), “tactical right-of-centre alliances” could dilute or even derail EU initiatives.
Those are most likely to include particular debates around migration and the green transition, with rightwing MEPs probably seeking to restrict the impact of climate legislation in particular on companies, households and individuals.
In these areas, and maybe others, parliament’s work could get complicated. Analysis of votes in the outgoing assembly by EUobserver and Novaya Gazeta Europe showed that 69 out of more than 2,000 final resolutions were decided by a narrow margin.
Under a more rightwing parliament, the analysis suggested, almost half of those 69 votes would have had a different outcome. Fully 40% of them were on green topics, but there were also tight outcomes on human rights and the rule of law.
Nicolai von Ondarza, of the German Institute for International Affairs (SWP), said that although the centre held, “European politics are going to get more polarising, more politicised and more populist”.
There would be much movement among the various parliamentary groups on the right, von Ondarza said, with AfD likely to try to form its own “righter-than-far-right” group but also MEPs from Orbán’s Fidesz seeking a new political home.
“But these movements will not affect the overall majority,” he said. “If anything, they are likely to further strengthen the EPP, which will grow even bigger,” with the addition of Péter Magyar’s new centre-right opposition party in Hungary, which scored 30%.
Although the far right’s big gains in France and Germany will have little impact on the European parliament as such, they could well have a major impact on EU politics, because – despite Brexiters’ claims – most EU power still resides in the capitals.
Von Ondarza said all of that would most likely leave Meloni as the figure to watch – in particular, “how far she and the ECR can get the likely commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and her EPP to work with them.”"
3904,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-10-16,"Kidney transplants are safe between people with HIV, new US study shows
People with HIV can safely receive donated kidneys from deceased donors with the virus, according to a large study that comes as the U.S. government moves to expand the practice. That could shorten the wait for organs for all, regardless of HIV status.
The new study, published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, looked at 198 kidney transplants performed across the U.S. Researchers found similar results whether the donated organ came from a person with or without the AIDS virus.
Last month, the Department of Health and Human Services proposed a rule change that would allow these types of kidney and liver transplants outside of research studies. A final rule would apply to both living and deceased donors. If approved, it could take effect in the coming year.
Participants in the study were HIV positive, had kidney failure and agreed to receive an organ from either an HIV-positive deceased donor or an HIV-negative deceased donor, whichever kidney became available first.
Researchers followed the organ recipients for up to four years. They compared the half who received kidneys from HIV-positive donors to those whose kidneys came from donors without HIV.
Both groups had similar high rates of overall survival and low rates of organ rejection. Virus levels rose for 13 patients in the HIV donor group and for four in the other group, mostly tied to patients failing to take HIV medications consistently, and in all cases returned to very low or undetectable levels.
“This demonstrates the safety and the fantastic outcomes that we’re seeing from these transplants,” said study co-author Dr. Dorry Segev of NYU Langone Health.
In 2010, surgeons in South Africa provided the first evidence that using HIV-positive donor organs was safe in people with HIV. But the practice wasn’t allowed in the United States until 2013 when the government lifted a ban and allowed research studies, at the urging of Segev. At first, the studies were with deceased donors. Then in 2019, Segev and others at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore performed the world’s first kidney transplant from a living donor with HIV to an HIV-positive recipient.
All told, 500 transplants of kidneys and livers from HIV-positive donors have been done in the U.S.
People with HIV have been actively discouraged from signing up to be organ donors by stigma and outdated state laws and policies criminalizing organ donation for people with HIV, said Carrie Foote, a sociology professor at Indiana University in Indianapolis.
“Not only can we help those of us living with this disease, but we free up more organs in the entire organ pool so that those who don’t have HIV can get an organ faster,” said Foote, who is HIV positive and a registered organ donor. “It’s a win-win for everyone.”
More than 90,000 people are on the waiting list for kidney transplants, according to the U.S. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. In 2022, more than 4,000 people died waiting for kidneys.
In an editorial in the journal, Dr. Elmi Muller of Stellenbosch University in South Africa predicted the new study will have “far-reaching effects in many countries that do not perform transplantations with these organs.”
“Above all, we have taken yet another step toward fairness and equality for persons living with HIV,” wrote Muller, who pioneered the practice.

2517,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-07-24,"Preliminary data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) showed the daily global average temperature was 17.15 degrees Celsius (62.9 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday, the warmest day in recorded history.
This was 0.06C hotter than the day before on July 21, which itself broke by a small margin the all-time high temperature set only a year before.
""This is exactly what climate science told us would happen if the world continued burning coal, oil and gas,"" said Joyce Kimutai, a climate scientist from Imperial College London, on Wednesday.
""And it will continue getting hotter until we stop burning fossil fuels and reach net zero emissions.""
Copernicus, which uses satellite data to update global air and sea temperatures close to real time, said its figures were provisional and final values may differ very slightly.
It anticipated daily records could keep toppling as summer peaks in the northern hemisphere, and the planet endures an extraordinary stretch of unprecedented heat on the back of the hottest-ever year.
The monitor on Tuesday said global temperatures were expected to drop soon though there could be further fluctuations.
Global warming is causing longer, stronger and more frequent extreme weather events, and this year has been marked by major disasters across the globe.
The historic heat has been felt on many continents including Asia, North America and Europe, where heatwaves and wildfires have torn a path of destruction in recent weeks.
Fires have also ripped through the Arctic, which is warming much faster than elsewhere on the planet, while winter temperatures were well above normal in Antarctica.
'Horrific temperatures'
Copernicus said it was less the fact daily temperature records were being rewritten than a broader pattern of never-before-seen warming that greatly worries climate scientists.
Every month since June 2023 has eclipsed its own temperature record compared to the same month in previous years, something never before seen.
The heat witnessed on Sunday and Monday only slightly exceeded the July 2023 record, but was far above the previous high of 16.8C set in August 2016.
Copernicus said that 16.8C record has been smashed 57 times since July 2023, around the time global temperatures began a steady rise into what scientists have called unchartered territory.
""The much used term 'unprecedented' no longer describes the horrific temperatures we are experiencing,"" Christiana Figueres, a former head of the UN's climate change body, said on Wednesday.
Copernicus records go back to 1940 but other sources of climate data such as ice cores, tree rings and coral skeletons allow scientists to expand their conclusions using evidence from much deeper in the past.
Climate scientists say the period being lived through right now is likely the warmest the earth has been for the last 100,000 years, back at the start of the last Ice Age.
The burning of fossil fuels is the primary driver of climate change and emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases keep rising despite global efforts to slow rising temperatures.
Copernicus on Tuesday said 2024 could pass 2023 as the hottest year on record but it was ""too early to predict with confidence"".

(AP Photo/Ryan Sun)
WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House is finalizing plans for a U.S.-Mexico border clampdown that would shut off asylum requests and automatically deny entrance to migrants once the number of people encountered by American border officials exceeded a new daily threshold, with President Joe Biden expected to sign an executive order as early as Tuesday, according to four people familiar with the matter.
The president has been weighing additional executive action since the collapse of a bipartisan border bill earlier this year. The number of illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border has declined for months, partly because of a stepped-up effort by Mexico. Still, immigration remains a top concern heading into the U.S. presidential election in November and Republicans are eager to hammer Biden on the issue.
The Democratic administration’s effort would aim to head off any potential spike in crossings that could occur later in the year, as the fall election draws closer, when the weather cools and numbers tend to rise, two of the people. They were not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing discussions and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
The move would allow Biden, whose administration has taken smaller steps in recent weeks to discourage migration and speed up asylum processing, to say he has done all he can do to control the border numbers without help from Congress.
The talks were still fluid and the people stressed that no final decisions had been made.
The restrictions being considered are an aggressive attempt to ease the nation’s overwhelmed asylum system, along with a new effort to speed up the cases of migrants already in America and another meant to quicken processing for migrants with criminal records or those who would otherwise be eventually deemed ineligible for asylum in the United States.
The people told the AP that the administration was weighing some of the policies directly from a stalled bipartisan Senate border deal, including capping the number of encounters at an average of 4,000 per day over a week and whether that limit would include asylum-seekers coming to the border with appointments through U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s CBP One app. Right now, there are roughly 1,450 such appointments per day.
Two of the people said one option is that migrants who arrive after the border reaches a certain threshold could be removed automatically in a process similar to deportation and would not be able to return easily. Migrants were able to more easily return to the border if they were expelled under the pandemic-era policy known as Title 42. Under that arrangement, Mexico agreed to take back some non-Mexican nationalities, including migrants from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.
Migrants, especially families, claiming asylum at the southern border are generally released into the U.S. to wait out their cases. But there are more than 2 million pending immigration court cases, and some people wait years for a court date while they live in limbo in the U.S.
Anyone can ask for asylum regardless of whether they arrive illegally at the border, but U.S. officials are increasingly pushing migrants to make appointments, use a legal pathway that avoids the costly and dangerous journey, or stay where they are and apply through outposts in Colombia, Guatemala and Costa Rica.
The Biden administration has grown ever more conservative on border issues as the president faces ceaseless criticism from Republicans and there are large numbers of migrants crossing into the U.S. from Mexico who are not easily returned, especially as global displacement grows from war, climate change and more.
The immigration authority that the administration has been looking to use is outlined in Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. It gives a president broad leeway to block entry of certain immigrants into the U.S. if it would be “detrimental” to the U.S. national interest.
Senate Republicans last week again blocked a bill that would have enshrined some of the same efforts into law. The vote was meant to underscore GOP resistance to the proposal even as Republicans have clamored for more restrictions and argued that Biden has not done enough to stem the flow of migrants entering into the U.S.
The bipartisan bill had been negotiated for months and appeared, for a moment anyway, to be heading toward passage. It was even endorsed by the National Border Patrol Council and its president Brandon Judd, an avowed supporter of Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. But Trump, concerned about handing Democrats an election-year win, called on Republicans to tank it, and they did.
White House officials did not confirm the expected executive order.
White House spokesman Angelo Fernández Hernández said the administration “continues to explore a series of policy options and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system.”
“While congressional Republicans chose to stand in the way of additional border enforcement, President Biden will not stop fighting to deliver the resources that border and immigration personnel need to secure our border,” he said.
Congress this year approved funding for a total of 41,500 detention beds and increased money for immigration enforcement and removal operations by $1.2 billion over what the White House had initially requested. That included $106 million in more funding for programs that monitor immigrants in the asylum system through phone apps and ankle bracelets, rather than through detention.
Those increases, negotiated after the collapse of the bipartisan deal, could pave the way for the administration to ratchet up immigration enforcement.
Yet unlike legislative action that is binding, anything Biden does through executive action can be challenged in the courts, and will almost certainly be, so it not clear whether — or if — the clampdown on asylum would begin. The administration was weighing other actions too, including faster and tougher enforcement of the asylum process.
The administration has generally paired proposed crackdowns with an expansion of legal paths elsewhere and was also planning to do so in the future, but not at the same time the new restrictions were announced, the people said.

Kamala Harris correct that immigration at the U.S. southern border has been cut by half or more
If Your Time is short
The size of the drop varies based on what time frame is used, but over roughly the past year, the number of encounters along the southwestern U.S. border — a common way to measure immigration — has declined by 57% to 78%.
Immigration has been one of the toughest issues for Vice President Kamala Harris to address on the campaign trail; her opponent, Donald Trump, has repeatedly spotlighted a spike of illegal immigration under her and President Joe Biden.
But in a recent CNN town hall in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, Harris offered an optimistic data point.
""As of today, we have cut the flow of immigration by over half,"" Harris told moderator Anderson Cooper Oct. 23.
She’s right. Depending on when you start counting, the drop is well over half.
The night of the town hall, Harris’ campaign pointed PolitiFact to official federal government data on encounters at the United States’ southwestern border with Mexico.
Encounters are occasions when immigration officials stop someone at the border. A single person could be stopped more than once and counted more than once, and encounters do not mean that the person is let into the U.S. But for understanding migration at the U.S. border, encounters are a standard metric.
Border Patrol encounters with migrants between ports of entry at the southwest land border peaked in December 2023 at about 250,000. In September, the latest month with available data and the end of fiscal year 2024, there were about 54,000 encounters. That’s a 78% drop, or more than half, U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows.
If you start with a different month, the drop is still significant. From September 2023 to September 2024, the number fell from about 219,000 to 54,000, a 75.3% decline. From January 2024 to September 2024, the number fell from about 124,200 to 54,000, a 56.5% drop.
U.S. immigration experts said it’s difficult to isolate single causes for changes in border arrival counts, but a Biden executive action that limits immigrants’ ability to apply for asylum at the southwest border took effect in June and likely has had an effect.
""The Biden playbook rests on narrowing asylum eligibility for migrants who cross the border illegally, expanding the use of lawful migration pathways, and encouraging Mexico, Panama, Costa Rica, and other regional partners to increase their migration controls and enforcement,"" the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, wrote in a recent analysis.
Taken together, the group added, ""these policies have ushered in a new era of migration management in response to unprecedented changes in flows over the last three and a half years. These efforts represent new and innovative approaches to managing migration, even as they are subject to litigation and change.""
Mexican efforts to increase its enforcement, driven partly by U.S. pressure, have also helped decrease immigration, experts say.
Biden and former Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador spoke multiple times beginning in late 2023 and released statements about joint efforts to curb immigration, fentanyl and firearms trafficking.
Featured Fact-check
U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Secretary of State Antony Blinken also went to Mexico in December to meet with their Mexican counterparts.
David Bier, immigration studies director at the libertarian Cato institute, told PolitiFact in June that it’s reasonable to attribute border encounter declines to actions by Mexico, with a caveat.
""Mexico is making unprecedented arrests,"" Bier said. ""I believe that it is unsustainable because, although Mexico is arresting them and sending them to southern Mexico, they are not deporting them to their home countries. This means that it is very likely they will ultimately find their way to the United States because they are still in Mexico, and there's not much for them to do there except keep trying to get to the U.S.""
Whether the declines will continue is uncertain, because migrants and migrant smugglers ""have proven highly adaptable to changes in policy, process, operations and even infrastructure,"" Theresa Cardinal Brown, senior adviser for immigration and border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank, told PolitiFact in June. ""We have not seen sustained decreases in arrivals after policy changes in the past.""
Harris said, ""As of today, we have cut the flow of immigration by over half.""
The size of the drop varies depending on what month you start counting from, but over roughly the past year, the number of encounters along the southwestern U.S. border has declined from 57% to 78%.

6398,real,GENDER_BASED_DISINFORMATION,2024-10-03,"Former first lady Melania Trump appeared to discuss her views on women's rights Thursday in a video on X, one day after publication of an excerpt from her coming memoir in which she reportedly takes a strong stance in support of abortion rights.
In the 28-second video, Trump says: ""Individual freedom is a fundamental principle that I safeguard. Without a doubt there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth.""
""Individual freedom. What does my body my choice really mean?"" she added.
The Guardian reported Wednesday that Trump defends abortion rights in her memoir, scheduled for release Tuesday.
NBC News has not independently verified The Guardian's report, which said Trump wrote: “Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman’s fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.
""Restricting a woman’s right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life,"" she continued, according to the report.
Asked about his wife's comments on abortion in an interview with Fox News on Thursday, former President Donald Trump said: ""We spoke about it, and I said, 'You have to write what you believe. I'm not going to tell you what to do. You have to write what you believe.'
""She's very beloved,"" he said. ""People love our former first lady, I can tell you that, but I said, 'You have to stick with your heart.' I've said that to everybody, 'You have to go with your heart.'""
Reached for comment about the former first lady's views on abortion, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung pointed to Donald Trump's remarks in the interview.
The former president has repeatedly touted his role in ending nationwide protections for abortion, saying he “was able to kill Roe v. Wade.”
“My view is, now that we have abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land,” he said in April. He said this week that he would not sign into law a measure to ban abortion nationwide if it were to reach his desk as president.
Harris campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement earlier Thursday that ""sadly for the women across America, Mrs. Trump’s husband firmly disagrees with her.""
Chitika pointed to Trump's presidency's leading to abortion restrictions and bans across many states. Vice President Kamala Harris has made reproductive care and abortion access a centerpiece of her campaign.
The comments from Melania Trump, who has been largely absent on the campaign trail, sparked criticism from the anti-abortion-rights group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life, which said in a post that “much of what she’s saying is simply not correct.”
The group’s president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, reposted the statement, adding: “The women of America are capable of great strength and creativity. They are naturally inclined to speak for those who are powerless. Abortion is not the source of their freedom and liberation.”
The former first lady's new position also prompted backlash from reproductive rights groups, which pointed to Donald Trump's record on abortion.
""This is just the latest example of politicians — or the politically-adjacent — shifting their position in rhetoric but not in action,"" Alexis McGill Johnson, the president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement Thursday.
""As president, he made it his mission to get Roe v. Wade overturned. Melania stood by him, never once publicly disavowing his actions until weeks before an election where our bodies are again on the ballot and they are losing voters to this issue,"" she continued. ""Read between the lines.""
Mini Timmaraju, the president of Reproductive Freedom for All, told NBC News that Melania Trump's seeming to come out in favor of abortion rights angered her because her statements could confuse voters who are not fully informed about the abortion-rights fight.
“If the Trump campaign was actually strategic, I would guess that this could actually help confuse underinformed voters and maybe give permission to soft Republican women who are conflicted because of abortion to hold their nose and vote for Trump,” she said. “Trump’s record is very clear. He overturned Roe. The contrast with VP Harris is clear. She’s been a champion of reproductive freedom her whole career."""
3630,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-09-07,"Missouri reports 1st human case of bird flu in the state
The case brings the national total to 14 so far this year.
Missouri reported its first confirmed human case of bird flu in a person who reported no exposure to animals, the state's health department said Friday.
The case brings the national total to 14 so far this year, according to federal data.
The latest case in Missouri was in an adult with underlying medical conditions, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said in a press release. The person was hospitalized on Aug. 22 and has since recovered, the health department said.
""The patient has reported no exposure to animals,"" the health department said.
The information is preliminary and would require further investigation by health authorities.
The case of bird flu, also known as H5, was initially detected through the state's normal influenza surveillance testing program. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also confirmed it to be a human case of the H5 subtype of flu, the Missouri health department said.
""The risk of sustained transmission or infection among the general public remains low,"" the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said.
Beyond Missouri, so far this year, 10 human cases of bird flu have been reported in Colorado, two in Michigan and one in Texas amid an outbreak in animals.
Before this year, there was only one reported case of bird flu in the United States -- in a Colorado poultry worker who was infected in 2022.
In March, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced a bird flu strain that had sickened millions of birds across the U.S. was identified in several mammals this year, including dairy cows.
Health officials say the food supply is safe and the risk to the general public is currently low.
Signs and symptoms of infection in humans often include sore throat, cough, fever, runny or stuffy nose, headache, muscle or body aches, fatigue and shortness of breath. Less common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and seizures.
Infections can range from no symptoms or mild illness, such as flu-like symptoms, to more severe illness, such as pneumonia that could require hospitalizations, the CDC said."
4604,real,ANTI_MIGRATION_AND_XENOPHOBIA,2024-08-14,"Republican National Convention delegates erupted in applause last month when Texas Gov. Greg Abbott doubled down on his commitment to send buses full of migrants to blue cities.
“We have continued busing migrants to sanctuary cities all across the country,” Abbott told the cheering crowd in Milwaukee. “Those buses will continue to roll until we finally secure our border.”
But the buses have not been rolling on a consistent basis for months because of a steep drop in the number of migrants apprehended at the southern border, according to officials and migrant shelter operators in Texas and in a half-dozen big cities across the U.S.
Roughly 117,000 migrants were stopped in May, down from a record 300,000 in December. In June, the number dropped even further — to about 84,000, the lowest monthly total since President Joe Biden took office in 2021.
“They now come much less frequently,” said Josh Goldfein, a staff attorney for the Legal Aid Society of New York, “because they don’t have enough people to cross the border to fill up a bus.”
White House officials and immigration advocates attribute the slowdown to an enhanced crackdown on U.S.-bound migrants by Mexican authorities and Biden’s executive action in June restricting who can claim asylum at the southern border.
A spokesman for Abbott acknowledged that there were now fewer migrants to bus out of state, but said that it was the governor’s actions in Texas that fueled the drop in migrants crossing the border.
“Texas has decreased illegal crossings into the state by 85% thanks to our historic border mission,” the spokesman, Andrew Maheris, said. “Fewer illegal crossings into Texas means there are fewer buses departing for sanctuary cities.”
Abbott started busing in 2022 as part of Operation Lone Star, an $11 billion program designed to address the migrant surge in Texas.
Large numbers of migrant buses rumbled out of the border towns of Del Rio and McAllen last year. But it has been several months since a single bus has left either of the two cities, local officials and migrant shelter operators told NBC News.
The last buses sponsored by Abbott to leave Laredo and Brownsville rolled out in January, according to people familiar with the issue. And the number of buses leaving El Paso has fallen off sharply in the past few months, according to two nonprofits that serve migrants.
“The opportunity exists for buses every Wednesday if the need is there,” said Bill Irvin, of the nonprofit Opportunity Center for the Homeless. ""And honestly, I have not had the need to use those buses from here for six to eight weeks. But that shows you how low the census has become amongst all of the shelters here in El Paso.”
A spokesperson for the Texas Division of Emergency Management, which has managed bus logistics in the past, said bus departures have fluctuated over time “due to the number of individuals processed and released by the federal government in overwhelmed border communities, which have an impact on passenger numbers.”
“The season/weather conditions seem to have an impact as well,” the spokesperson added in an email.
But officials in multiple cities that had been receiving buses in the past said none have arrived from Texas since January.
The last bus to reach Philadelphia arrived on Dec. 17 with 29 people from Del Rio, Texas, according to a spokesperson with the city’s Office of Immigrant Affairs.
No Abbott buses have arrived in Washington, D.C., this year, according to a person familiar with the influx. None are believed to have rolled into Los Angeles since Jan. 20, according to Joseph Riser, of the county’s office of emergency management. And he said that bus was carrying only 18 people.
“They came pretty sparsely loaded,” he said.
Denver last received a bus arranged by Abbott’s office in June, according to a city official. A bus arrived in a Chicago suburb that same month, but none has rolled into the city of Chicago since Christmas, officials said.
Chicago is set to host the Democratic National Convention next week. A spokesperson for the mayor's office said the city isn't expecting an influx of new arrivals but is making preparations just in case.
And in New York, the buses largely stopped arriving after Mayor Eric Adams imposed restrictions on them in December and filed a lawsuit in January against 17 bus companies that were bringing migrants to the city from Texas.
Instead, the buses had been dropping off migrants in New Jersey, where they were given train tickets to Manhattan. But even those buses mostly stopped in June after Biden signed his executive action, according to immigration activist Power Malu, who took a leading role in welcoming migrants to the city.
He coordinated his efforts in New York with a network of immigration advocates in Texas via a chat group on an encrypted app. “We always knew when the buses were coming,” said Malu, who runs the grassroots organization Artists-Athletes-Activists.
Malu noted that while the buses from Abbott made headlines, much of the flow into New York during the historic migrant surge was through airports and migrants paying for their own bus tickets.
Local officials in Texas border towns say the lack of migrants coming across the border has caused some shelters to recalibrate.
Victor Trevino Jr., who works as an attorney for the mayor of the city of Laredo, said, ""We’re even getting NGOs now having to downsize because of the lack of intakes."""
5185,fake,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-11-05,"11/05/2024 / By Ethan Huff
The Energy and Commerce Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives released a 113-page report this week outlining the many ways in which Joe Biden and Kamala Harris wasted nearly $1 billion in U.S. taxpayer money spreading misinformation about the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).
Tony Fauci, in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), spearheaded a media misinformation campaign that deliberately misled America about the “science” surrounding COVID.
According to Ian Miller of the Brownstone Institute, the Biden regime “repeatedly, profoundly, and often purposefully” communicated “inaccurate information while spending hundreds of millions of dollars to get their preferred messages across.”
Really ramping up the propaganda in 2021, the Biden regime and its partners at the CDC, the HHS and other media entities and government agencies spent unimaginable amounts of taxpayer money misleading people about face masks, the so-called “vaccines,” social distancing and more.
“While the Biden-Harris administration’s public health guidance led to prolonged closures of schools and businesses, the NIH was spending nearly a billion dollars of taxpayer money trying to manipulate Americans with advertisements – sometimes containing erroneous or unproven information,” commented Cathy McMorris (R-Wash.), the committee’s chair.
“By overpromising what the Covid-19 vaccines could do – in direct contradiction of the FDA’s authorizations – and over emphasizing the virus’s risk to children and young adults, the Biden-Harris administration caused Americans to lose trust in the public health system. Our investigation also uncovered the extent to which public funding went to Big Tech companies to track and monitor Americans, underscoring the need for stronger online data privacy protections.”
(Related: Another thing Kamala Harris plans to do if installed into the White House is implement climate change authoritarianism, which in turn will destroy America’s economy.)
One of the biggest lies spread by the Biden regime centered around the idea that the so-called “vaccines” help to prevent COVID infections. Biden’s “Stop the Spread” campaign was launched to convince Americans that if they agreed to get jabbed, the “pandemic” would end.
“The entire premise of the Biden-Harris ‘Stop the Spread’ campaign was that if you got vaccinated for COVID-19, you could resume daily activities because they said vaccinated people would not spread the disease,” said Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations Chair Morgan Griffith (R-Va.).
“Despite lacking scientific basis, the administration bought into this CDC claim and misled the American public. As a result, vaccination coverage with other vaccines appears to have declined, I believe because of a growing distrust of information coming from our public health institutions.”
“Stop the Spread,” by the way, was even more sinister than originally believed in that it deliberately hid messaging from the CDC warning that it was unknown whether or not the jabs stopped either infection or transmission of COVID. The “science,” a Biden regime marketing sheet admits, is anything but settled.
Even so, the Biden regime imposed strict jab mandate requirements that are now the subject of numerous lawsuits. Members of the military, law enforcement and other sectors were told they had to get jabbed or else risk losing their jobs, even though the “science” led to more questions rather than answers.
Without any evidence whatsoever, the new report states, the Biden regime claimed falsely that “COVID vaccines were highly effective against transmission,” a lie that led to tens of thousands of completely avoidable injuries and deaths. The world figured this all out a few months after the fact, which the report admits had a “negative impact on vaccine confidence and the CDC’s credibility when proven untrue.”

5897,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-10-02,"Ukraine's Prosecutor-General’s Office has initiated an investigation into what it describes as the ""largest mass execution"" of Ukrainian ""prisoners of war"" by Russian troops since the start of Moscow's full-scale invasion more than 31 months ago.
RFE/RL's Ukraine Live Briefing gives you the latest developments on Russia's invasion, Western military aid, the plight of civilians, and territorial control maps. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.
According to an official statement published on the office’s Telegram channel, Russian forces allegedly killed 16 Ukrainian ""prisoners of war"" near the villages of Mykolayivka and Sukhiy Yar in the Pokrovsk district of the Donetsk region.
Videos circulated on various Telegram channels appear to show Ukrainian soldiers, freshly captured by Russian troops, emerging from a forested area.
After the prisoners have lined up, Russian forces appear to opened fire. The videos then appear to show Russian soldiers approaching those who were only wounded and shooting them again at close range with machine guns.
The videos have not been independently verified.
Under international humanitarian law, executing soldiers who have surrendered is considered a war crime.
""This is the largest reported case of the execution of Ukrainian POWs on the front line and yet another indication that the killing and torture of prisoners of war are not isolated incidents,"" Ukraine's Prosecutor-General Andriy Kostin said on X.
""This is a deliberate policy of the Russian military and political leadership.""
Ukraine's Commissioner for Human Rights Dmytro Lubinets said he had contacted both the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross over the deaths, citing violations of the Geneva Conventions, which govern the treatment of prisoners of war.
The incident is not the first time such allegations against Russian soldiers have surfaced.
In September, CNN released two videos purportedly showing Russian military personnel executing Ukrainian soldiers as they were surrendering.
The footage, filmed by drones and provided by Ukrainian military intelligence, included audio transcripts that seemingly captured the order to execute the soldiers.
Ukraine’s Prosecutor-General's Office informed CNN then that it was currently investigating at least 28 cases involving the murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war since Russia launched its full-scale aggression against its neighbor in February 2022.
Russia has yet to respond to the accusations.
Earlier in August, Danielle Bell, the head of mission for the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, said that 95 percent of Ukrainian soldiers captured by Russia face torture."
3510,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-10-14,"Report: US calorie intake may reduce by trillions by 2030, grocery sales report says
A surge in the use of GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic or Wegovy play a role in a projected calorie intake decline of 10 trillion in U.S. adults by 2030, according to a new report.
The U.S. total calorie consumption reduction marks the first since 1960s, according to a report by Impact Analytics published Oct 9. The report analyzed grocery retail sales data across various U.S. regions including the Northeast, Southeast, Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest.
The AI-driven data group reported that by 2030, the average adult should consume 100 to 800 less kilocalories per year, leading to an around 10 trillion kilocalorie annual reduction in most U.S. adults.
The average American consumes around 3,864 calories per day, according data by the U.S. Department of Agriculture last updated in early 2023.
The Impact Analytics report expects that number to decrease between 2,800 and 3,500 for the majority of adults.
The report listed a surge in GLP-1 drug usage as a factor for a shift toward healthier food options alongside public initiatives like calorie labeling and soda taxes as well as overall health awareness. A shift toward healthier food options and distaste for processed foods is expected to alter how grocers will merchandise their shelf space, according to the report.
Ozempic, Wegovy alternatives: Are these cheaper weight loss drugs sold online safe?
Healthy food sales have risen in recent years
Between 2022 and 2024, U.S. sales in healthy food categories have increased around 5-8.7% annually, according to the report.
""We're moving from the sugary foods, processed foods to more healthy foods,"" Impact Analytics CEO Prashant Agrawal told USA TODAY. ""GLP is a cause of it. There's also the fact that people are more worried about ultra-processed foods.""
Grocery stores in the Midwest have most growth in healthy food sales, averaging between 10-22%, while the Northeast has seen a 0.5-5% shift away from unhealthy options.
The demand for fresh produce and organic products has also risen, with a 12.4% increase in fresh fruit sales and a 9.2% increase in vegetable sales growth between 2023 and 2024.
Agrawal added that he expects the shift to alter the way grocers assort what items to stock five years from now as well as store layouts.
GLP-1 drug usage continues to surge
While GLP-1 drugs have seen a drastic surge in the U.S. since the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of Wegovy (semaglutide) injection to treat chronic weight in 2021. It was the first chronic weight management drug approved to treat obese or overweight adults since 2014.
The popularity of GLP-1 receptor drugs has also grown immensely with consumers. Quarterly sales of anti-obesity drugs surpassed $1.1 billion midway through 2023, according to a report from the Congressional Budget Office.
Last year one in 60 adults were prescribed a GLP-1 medication, according to the American Pharmacists Association, and the number is expected to rise.

CALGARY, Alberta (LifeSiteNews) — Alberta officials have announced that almost all fires in 2024 are believed to have been caused by humans despite ongoing claims that “climate change” is to blame.
On April 24, Alberta Minister of Forestry and Parks Todd Loewen revealed that his department estimates that most of the province’s wildfires this year are man-made and not caused by “climate change” as claimed by mainstream media and politicians.
“We expect that almost all of the wildfires we’ve experienced so far this year are human caused, given the point we’re at in the season and the types of weather we’re seeing,” Loewen stated.
Already, Alberta has put out 172 wildfires this year, and 63 are actively burning. However, Loewen did not seem overly alarmed, instead warning Albertans to watch their local fire bans and restrictions to reduce the high number of man-made wildfires.
“I urge you to assess your property for wildfire danger and take any preventive action you can to address these risks,” he said.
“This includes breaking up fuel sources that could ignite a structure, removing trees in close proximity to your home, and properly maintaining your gutters and roofs to rid the materials that could easily ignite such as leaves and dry needles,” Loewen added.
Loewen’s announcement comes just weeks after Alberta Premier Danielle Smith promised that arsonists who ignite wildfires in Alberta will be held accountable for their crimes.
“As we approach the wildfire season, it is important to understand that 67% of wildfires in Alberta are started by people,” she explained.
“If you start a wildfire, you can be charged, fined, and held liable for all costs associated with fighting the wildfire,” Smith added.
Smith made the comments after last year revealing that most of the wildfires in her province (500 of the 650) were caused by humans and not “climate change,” as has been pushed by the legacy media and opposition politicians.
“All I know is in my province we have 650 fires and 500 of them were human caused,” she said, “so we have to make sure that when people know that when it’s dry out there and we get into forest fire season that they’re being a lot more careful because anytime you end up with an ignition that happens it can have devastating consequences.”
The Alberta government has also created an ad campaign highlighting the fact that most fires are caused by humans and not “climate change,” as many left-leaning politicians claim.
As reported by LifeSiteNews last year, Smith ordered arson investigators to look into why some of the wildfires that raged across the vast expanse of the province had “no known cause” shortly after they spread.
Indeed, despite claims that wildfires have drastically increased due to “climate change,” 2023 research revealed that wildfires have decreased globally while media coverage has spiked 400 percent.
Furthermore, many of the fires last spring and summer were discovered to be caused by arsonists and not “climate change.”
Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) have arrested arsonists who have been charged with lighting fires across the country, including in the Yukon, British Columbia, and Alberta.
In Quebec, satellite footage also showed the mysterious simultaneous eruption of several blazes across the province, sparking concerns that the fires were a coordinated effort by arsonists.
Despite the overwhelming evidence, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and mainstream media continue to claim that the fires are unprecedentedly dangerous and caused by “climate change” in an attempt to pass further regulations on natural resources.
The reduction and eventual elimination of the use of so-called “fossil fuels” and a transition to unreliable “green” energy has also been pushed by the World Economic Forum (WEF) – the globalist group behind the socialist “Great Reset” agenda – an organization with which Trudeau and some in his cabinet are involved.
While Trudeau’s plan has been pushed under the guise of “sustainability,” his intention to decrease nitrous oxide emissions by limiting the use of fertilizer has been criticized by farmers. They say this will reduce profits and could even lead to food shortages.

3571,fake,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-09-25,"On Feb. 26, 2021, at the height of the ""pandemic,"" CNN covered a study out of the United Kingdom claiming that a single dose of Pfizer's mRNA (modRNA) injection is enough to provide ""strong protection for those who've had Covid-19."" A few months later, CNN claimed that people who got jabbed could safely go indoors without wearing a face mask.
A couple months after that, CNN ran the following headline counteracting its earlier story to the contrary:
""CDC updates guidance, recommends vaccinated people wear masks indoors in certain areas""
After that, CNN was informing its readers that if they listened to the earlier guidance about getting jabbed for protection, well, that protection does not exactly last like was initially claimed. According to CNN as of Dec. 23, 2021:
""Vaccine protection against Covid-19 wanes over time, especially for older people, CDC says""
Reminder: The unvaccinated were right!
CNN's coverage of the vax started with how effective it is and ending with:

— Eddie (@Eddies_X) September 23, 2024
(Related: Earlier this year, CNN published a piece calling for the government to restrict how much Americans are allowed to travel abroad: ""carbon passports may be the answer."")
Concerning the Johnson & Johnson injection, which differs from what Pfizer and Moderna offered, CNN told its readers and viewers who took it that the one-and-done format initially recommended by the manufacturer was no longer enough, as of Oct. 16, 2021: J&J jab recipients would now need a second dose as soon as possible.
After that, Tony Fauci came out to recommend a third dose of whatever Covid injection you want, assuming you only got two jabs. And CNN parroted Fauci's recommendations as scientific fact.
Then, not long after that, CNN was pushing people to take a fourth dose of Covid shot, this time claiming that the CDC said to do this. In other words, if Fauci and / or the CDC say to do it, then CNN wants you to do it.
All of this culminated with an Oct. 19, 2021, article from CNN bearing the following bizarre headline:
""Why vaccinated people dying from Covid-19 doesn't mean the vaccines are ineffective""
It is difficult to ascertain how CNN got away with pushing all this contradictory content all around the same time to its followers. Are CNN supporters schizophrenic just like the network's editorial team apparently is?
Keep in mind that around the time CNN was publishing all these schizophrenic headlines, the federal government of the United States was busy changing the definition of terms like ""vaccine"" and ""immunization"" to fit the emerging narrative.
""They changed the scientific and medical definition of vaccine and immunization in late 2021,"" someone wrote on X about this.
""MSM changes any definition to fit their narrative like the definition of a woman etc.,"" wrote another.
Another person joked about what CNN is actually saying with all of its contradictory content about Covid jabs:
""It went from 'safe and effective' to 'well, you'll die, but you'll go to heaven' at warp speed.""
""Four of my family members died from the vaccine,"" added another. ""Autopsy showed strange, horrible blood clots throughout their bodies. They were all previously healthy and under 40.""

Last year, William Happer, Professor Emeritus of Physics at Princeton University, spoke on Sky News Australia about common misconceptions in climate science, particularly the negative perception of carbon dioxide (CO2).
“More CO2 is beneficial for the world, not harmful. It’s absurd to try to reduce CO2,” he stated. (Related: Carbon dioxide revealed as the “Miracle Molecule of Life” for re-greening the planet.)
Happer explained that the planet is currently experiencing a CO2 shortage compared to what’s typical of plant life. “If you provide more CO2 to almost any plant, it will thrive. Greenhouses often double or triple CO2 levels because plants grow better and the quality of flowers and fruits improves,” he said. (Related: New NASA satellite data prove carbon dioxide is GREENING the Earth and restoring forests.)
He added that since the Cambrian explosion, which marked the rapid emergence of complex life about 541 million years ago, CO2 levels have significantly decreased. High CO2 levels during that period likely played a key role in life’s evolution. Studies indicate that CO2 concentrations were much higher then, with some estimates suggesting levels between 1,000 to 4,000 parts per million (ppm), compared to around 400 ppm today.
“Historically, CO2 levels have often been three to five times higher than they are now. Plants evolved to thrive in higher CO2 conditions, so today’s lower levels can harm them,” Happer explained.
One such harm is photorespiration, a process where low CO2 levels cause plants to expend energy detoxifying oxygen instead of growing. “When CO2 is low, the enzyme plants use gets poisoned by oxygen – forcing plants to use resources to counteract this instead of growing,” he said. Doubling CO2 levels reduces the need for this protective effort – enhancing plant growth.
Happer criticized the portrayal of CO2 as a threat. “It’s incredible that a gas essential to life has been turned into a villain. We’re made of carbon, and each person exhales about two pounds of CO2 daily. With 8 billion people, it’s a natural part of life,” he remarked.
The Compressed Gas Association (CGA) noted that despite its often negative portrayal, carbon dioxide (CO2) is a naturally occurring gas essential for life on Earth.
Humans and animals need CO2 to help regulate respiration and maintain proper blood pH levels. Plants use CO2 for photosynthesis, a process where they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen. This oxygen-rich air supports the oxygenation of our blood, benefiting brain function and overall health.
CO2 is a versatile gas with numerous applications:
In agriculture, CO2 enhances growth in greenhouses and similar environments, promoting faster growth and higher yields. All animals, including humans, rely on green plants that convert CO2 and water into carbohydrates, releasing oxygen. Plants get carbon from CO2 in the air and other nutrients from the soil. Plants grow better in CO2-rich environments, which is why greenhouses often pump in additional CO2 to boost plant growth.
Higher CO2 levels also make plants more drought-resistant. Plant leaves have tiny openings called stomata, which allow CO2 to enter the leaf and be used in photosynthesis. However, water molecules can also escape through these openings. With higher CO2 levels, plants can reduce the number of stomata, losing less water and becoming more efficient in water use.
The 30 percent rise in atmospheric CO2 during the 20th century increased crop productivity by around 15 percent. Ongoing improvements in crop varieties, fertilizers and water management, combined with higher CO2 levels, will enhance food security in regions where hunger is prevalent, such as parts of Africa and Asia.
CO2 is used in medical diagnostics, particularly in gas mixtures with oxygen to help diagnose respiratory diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These mixtures are crucial for assessing lung function.
Dry ice, a solid form of CO2, is widely used in medical settings for flash-freezing biological samples, removing growths and refrigerating medications during transportation.
CO2 is used to preserve and freeze foods. Liquid CO2 or dry ice quickly freezes food, maintaining its color and texture by limiting ice crystal formation.
In the meat and poultry industries, CO2 is used for stunning animals and keeping meat cool during processing and blending.
Dry ice is used across various industries for cleaning surfaces and enhancing sanitation without harmful chemicals. It is also an eco-friendly method for stopping leaks and cleaning up industrial spills, leaving no waste product behind.
CO2 serves as an effective cleaning solvent in industries like semiconductor and electronics manufacturing, replacing other solvents that can have harmful environmental impacts. Dry ice blasting is an alternative to sandblasting, used for cleaning without leaving residues.

3028,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-07-30,"Government sets record budget for green energy auction
The government is set to significantly raise the budget for this year's renewable energy auction, following calls from industry for more support.
Energy Secretary Ed Miliband announced on Wednesday that the budget would be increased to £1.5bn, up by £500m from last year.
The majority of the funding will be available to develop offshore wind power, which the Labour government says it wants to quadruple by 2030.
The extra money has been broadly welcomed by the renewables industry, but there are warnings that without other changes, any new projects may not be delivered in time.
The government holds an auction each year to encourage companies to bid to develop renewable energy projects to supply the UK grid with electricity. The scheme is designed to ensure projects get a guaranteed price - known as the strike price - from the government for the electricity they will generate, which it is hoped will enable companies to have the confidence to invest.
Last year, developers did not bid for any offshore wind contracts - they argued that the price being offered was too low to make the projects viable.
In November, the former Conservative government significantly increased the strike price for offshore wind projects in response.
Mr Miliband has said Labour's commitment to maintain this higher price and increase the budget available for projects would ""restore the UK as a global leader for green technologies"".
But Claire Coutinho, shadow Energy Secretary, said the government's plans were untested and uncosted.
“Labour are ramping up renewables, at the same time as decimating investment in gas which is our only existing back up for when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow. What will be put in its place? Ed Miliband can’t tell you,"" she said.
Esin Serin, policy fellow at LSE's Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, said the budget increase was a ""welcome and necessary step"".
But she added that this year's auction would likely only deliver 10GW of the 40GW needed for Labour to meet its 2030 target.
""It obviously leaves a significant amount of work to future rounds,"" she said.
This announcement is one of a number of measures the Labour government has rolled out since the election to boost renewable energy, including removing planning restrictions on onshore wind and teaming up with the Crown Estate to develop new offshore wind projects.
Dr Rahmat Poudineh from the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies agreed that the higher budget would bring in more bids but warned that developers still faced challenges, including unexpected cost increases and delays in connecting their projects to the grid.
The government wants to see renewable energy projects grow quickly to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel use. But it also says it wants to increase energy independence to protect billpayers from fluctuations in the international energy market.
Gas prices hit record highs in 2022 as the Russian invasion of Ukraine caused disruptions to supply.
If the price the government guarantees to renewable energy developers ends up being much higher than the eventual price on the market in 2030 then the taxpayer could lose money.
But Jess Ralston, head of energy at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said it was more likely that scheme would break even.
And she added that if there was to be another gas crisis then the wind energy secured at this auction could save £30-40 per year on every household's energy bill in the future."
3405,fake,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-10-21,"(LifeSiteNews) — Families harmed by gender ideology, including some who had their children mutilated with transgender drugs and surgeries, want the Supreme Court to uphold state prohibitions on minors receiving the permanently damaging procedures.
Partners for Ethical Care filed an amicus brief in the United States v. Skrmetti case on behalf of families whose children either took drugs and surgeries to alter their appearances or who were at least pressured to do so.
The court will address this question: “Whether Tennessee Senate Bill 1, which prohibits all [so-called] medical treatments intended to allow ‘a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor’s sex’ or to treat ‘purported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor’s sex and asserted identity,’ violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.” The court will hear the case on December 4.
The filers are “parents of children who believed they were transgender and wanted medical interventions to change their bodies to conform to an identity that was inconsistent with their sex.” It is not possible for someone to change his sex. Further, the brief reiterates that there is mounting evidence of the dangers of the drugs and surgeries, which supports states’ rights to protect kids from them, filers stressed.
The parents were “subjected to misinformation and coercion from health care providers attempting to convince them to consent to the interventions,” according to the brief.
Proponents of subjecting children to life-altering surgeries, which can render them infertile and leave them with bone density loss, will often claim that the interventions are important to prevent suicide. “You must affirm or she will kill herself. Do you want a live son or a dead daughter?” one hospital told parents of a gender-confused child, according to the brief. This is a common tactic of medical professionals who push gender ideology.
Even when the children did not have surgeries or get all the drugs requested, it still divided families, as pro-LGBT medical professionals eagerly pushed the interventions on behalf of the gender-confused child.
Brief highlights ‘deception’ and ‘lifelong injuries’
The brief highlights testimonies of “deception,” “lifelong injuries,” and “rending of family units,” which “illustrate the wisdom of Tennessee’s and Kentucky’s decision to prohibit the [procedures] for minors.”
For example, several families shared stories about their schools, including a homeschool co-op, secretly using different names for their children and otherwise hiding their new “gender identity.” They also shared horror stories of healthcare practitioners downplaying the risks of puberty blockers and pushing the idea the drugs would make their children happier.
Some children received the drugs – and demanded more.
One victim, a boy referred to as “B.” in the filing, “received puberty blockers after a single visit with an endocrinologist who met with B. without his parents present. According to B., the endocrinologist told him that they needed to get his parents ‘on board’ with his receiving estrogen once the puberty blockers started.”
“Within a week of receiving puberty blockers, B. began angrily demanding cross-sex hormones, i.e., estrogen,” the brief stated.
Medical practitioners repeated the false claim that transgender drugs are needed to lower suicide risk; in fact, the drugs have been linked to suicide. The parent, Andrea, was told her son would “commit suicide if she did not agree with his demand for hormones.”
Instead of making the boy more emotionally stable, the drugs actually appeared to make him worse.
He “became increasingly unstable and continued to demand hormones” and “began writing profanity-laden emails to the gender clinic demanding that they prescribe hormones over his mom’s objection.” This created a further “wedge” between the parent and child, as the doctors said they wanted to hand out the drugs to him, but couldn’t without his mom’s consent, according to the brief.
“Puberty blockers have done nothing to help B., but have only increased his instability, placing him on a conveyor belt to sterilizing cross-sex hormones,” the brief warns.
Parents shared similar stories of being pushed puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones.
Pornography, social media, peer pressure drive identification
The comments in the brief illustrate further how the medical establishment has bought into transgender ideology to the detriment of families. It also provides further evidence that transgenderism is driven largely by social influence and technology, including pornography use. YouTube and Tumblr were cited several times.
Two of the families harmed had children who had underlying mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, which appeared to contribute to the kids seeking out social media content and pornography and identifying as “transgender” or “pansexual.”
One girl, who attended a school for students with special needs, was heavily encouraged to “transition” by a psychiatrist.
The parents, referred to as Liz and Chris Doe, experienced this:
When mom came in, the psychiatrist informed Liz that they had decided A. was going to use her new name and pronouns at summer camp. Taken aback, Liz informed the psychiatrist it was a girls’ camp. The psychiatrist told Liz “they know how to handle these situations.”
Their daughter is currently wearing a “chest binder” and wants to have her breasts removed. “The Does are striving to protect their daughter from these medical interventions. A. at times refuses to talk with her parents because they
will not grant her demands,” the brief states. “They feel their parental authority has been taken out of their hands.”
Many parents cited, either specifically or in similar language, the phenomenon of social contagion, which is linked to Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria and refers to transgender identification (to which could be added all the other LGBT “identities”) being driven by peer pressure.
The Does said more of their daughter’s friends have “join[ed] the transgender social trend.” Another family shared how only one person among their child’s 10 or 15 friends identifies as their actual sex.
The parent, Kristine, “notes these numbers mimic known social contagions, such as anorexia and cutting behavior,” according to the brief. Her daughter has “OCD, Tourette’s Syndrome and bulimia,” which underscores the connection between mental illness and transgender identification.
This brief is just one of many that are sounding the alarm on the harms of transgenderism and asking for the Supreme Court to uphold Kentucky and Tennessee’s protections for gender-confused minors.
The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has also called on the court to uphold the prohibitions, as has an accomplished Vanderbilt University legal scholar. Numerous other briefs on behalf of medical experts, academic scholars, and “detransitioners” have also been filed, according to the Supreme Court docket."

At a CNN Climate Town Hall on Sept. 4, 2019, then-Sen. Kamala Harris wanted the government to create “incentives” for Americans to eat less meat, even agreeing to change the food pyramid. According to her, this could curb the effects of climate change.
The event was part of the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries. Before she dropped out of the race, a voter asked if she supported changing the nation’s dietary guidelines to reduce the consumption of red meat – because, according to the woman, climate change is linked to the “overproduction of red meat.”
Harris answered: “I think the point that you’re raising in a broader context, which is that, as a nation, we actually have to have a real priority at the highest level of government around what we eat and in terms of healthy eating because we have a problem in America.”
“So the answer is yes,” she continued. “I will also say this: The balance that we have to strike here, frankly, is about what government can and should do around creating incentives, and then banning certain behaviors.”
During the same gathering, she admitted to having cheeseburgers from time to time. “But there also has to be what we do in terms of creating incentives that we will eat in a healthy way, that we will encourage moderation, and that we will be educated about the effect of our eating habits on our environment. We have to do a much better job at that, and the government has to do a much better job at that,” she said.
Meanwhile, the administration of President Joe Biden has been pushing ways to combat climate change by reducing carbon dioxide emissions, switching to electric vehicles and allegedly even eating meat substitutes such as bugs rather than consuming red meat.
“Joe Biden’s climate plan includes cutting 90 percent of red meat from our diets by 2030,” Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) tweeted in 2021. “They want to limit us to about four pounds a year. Why doesn’t Joe stay out of my kitchen?” But Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack denied it back then.
“There is no effort designed to limit people’s intake of beef coming out of President Biden’s White House or USDA,” Vilsack said as reported by Politico. “Sometimes in the political world, games get played and issues are injected into the conversation knowing full well that there’s no factual basis.”
Harris’ previous video where she talked about the youth experiencing “climate anxiety” while projecting their future has recently resurfaced and it elicited scrutiny and negative reactions from Republicans, journalists and even Big Tech mogul Elon Musk.
“Shamala is an extinctionist. The natural extension of her philosophy would be a de facto holocaust for all of humanity!” Musk wrote Saturday, July 27, on his social platform X. (Related: Make way for PRESIDENT KAMALA as Biden exits stage.)
The video of Harris from September 2023, was shared by Donald Trump Jr. as well as Republicans’ vice-presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance (R-OH). In the said footage, Harris argued the large young voter turnout in 2020 was in part due to their concerns about climate change.
“Because young people said, ‘We’re not leaving it to other people to decide how we are dealing with the climate crisis’ – you know, I’ve heard young leaders talk with me about a term they’ve coined called ‘climate anxiety,'” Harris said at Reading Area Community College, as part of her “Fight for Our Freedoms” college tour.
Trump Jr. on Saturday claimed Harris was “suggesting young people should not have children due to climate change.” Vance reposted former President Donald Trump’s son’s comments on X: “It’s almost like these people don’t want young people starting families or something. Really weird stuff.”

3697,fake,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-10-14,"(The Daily Signal) — More than 200 hospitals and health care facilities provide irreversible transgender procedures to children, debunking left-wing claims that the treatments aren’t being done on minors.
Medical non-profit watchdog Do No Harm launched a database October 8 of 225 hospitals that provide sex-change surgeries, puberty blockers, and/or hormone therapies to children.
Do No Harm matched known gender-related transition codes with gender-related procedures and prescription codes to compile the database.

“The database provides conclusive proof that these interventions are happening on children across the country, both hormonal interventions and surgeries,” said Beth Serio, external relations manager at Do No Harm and a registered nurse. “We used bulletproof data from insurance claims databases to show that these procedures have been done on children.”
Nearly 14,000 American children underwent sex-change interventions of some type between 2019 and 2023, according to Do No Harm’s analysis of thousands of insurance claims at hospitals and pediatric facilities in the United States.
“It’s a common lie in the trans industry in America that these procedures are very highly reversible, that there’s no long-term effects,” Serio told The Daily Signal. “We know that’s simply not the case, especially for children who are taking the hormones for a longer period of time. Some of them can have a sterilizing effect on children, especially when taken for a lengthy period of time.”
Almost 6,000 children have undergone transgender surgeries, while 8,579 have been given hormones and puberty blockers.
“We only included data that we could stand behind 100%, based on [Do No Harm’s] analysis of insurance claims data,” Serio said. “We cannot account for things such as cash or self-pay patients, or a couple of insurance companies who don’t report to these databases. As staggering as these numbers are, we’re pretty confident that there are even more children that have been impacted by these barbaric treatments.”
Families have paid more than $119 million for their children to medically attempt to change genders, the database documents.
The database highlights the 12 worst-offending hospitals for transitioning children, starting with the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, or CHOP, as it refers to itself.
The hospital has treated 122 child sex-change patients. Five children are transgender surgery patients, while 117 are on hormone-replacement regimens and puberty blockers. It has written 768 “gender-affirming care” prescriptions, totaling $230,784 in submitted charges.
CHOP provides “comprehensive gender assessment, gender-affirming medical care, support groups, referrals for outpatient therapy, surgical referrals,” and more, according to its website.
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia did not respond to The Daily Signal’s request for comment.
“Some children and youth identify their gender as different from the sex they were assigned at birth,” the website for the hospital, which serving patients under 21, says. “Affirming your child’s gender identity and allowing them to explore their gender and sexuality is crucial for their well-being and resilience.”
But research has found that so-called gender-affirming care actually increases the likelihood that youths will attempt suicide. According to one April study, “Gender-affirming surgery is significantly associated with elevated suicide-attempt risks, underlining the necessity for comprehensive post-procedure psychiatric support.”
READ: Pope urged to approve ‘sex changes’ during meeting with New Ways Ministry
Minors who received transgender procedures have increasingly been detransitioning after regretting taking hormones and/or having healthy body parts surgically removed. Chloe Cole started identifying as a boy at 12 years old and went under the knife at just 15, only to regret it a few months later. She is now 20.
Like many other detransitioners, having a surgeon remove her breasts failed to address Cole’s underlying struggles with anxiety, depression, and undiagnosed autism.
Hospitals in Connecticut, Minnesota, Washington state, California, Massachusetts, and Ohio are also on Do No Harm’s list of worst offenders.
“There’s a lot of studies and research that show that many of these children have comorbidities with different mental health illnesses, and we know that medicalizing does not decrease the incidence of mental health problems. Instead, it increases, typically, the mental health problems that they have,” Serio said. “So, we really have to ask ourselves: ‘Why are we doing it?’”
“It’s not even, to me, so much about ‘What are the risks?’ There are only risks,” she continued. “But what are the benefits? Why would anyone choose or recommend these drugs to children?”

2445,real,INSTITUTIONAL_AND_MEDIA_DISTRUST_PUBLIC_INSTITUTIONS,2024-06-10,"Mariam Lau: For German voters, immigration has trumped AfD scandals
In Germany, the further rise of the far right was expected – every poll had predicted as much. What was not expected, however, was that revelations of alleged corruption and involvement of the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) with the Russian and Chinese governments would apparently matter so little to its voters. Though the resulting gains – the AfD jumped to 16% from 11% in 2019 – were overall more modest than looked probable in the spring, across east Germany the far right came out ahead of all other parties.
Neither did it seem to worry the AfD base much that Germany’s domestic intelligence services had declared the party “under suspicion of extremism”. Quite the contrary: when asked in a TV poll whether their vote was mainly a protest against the red-green-liberal government or out of affiliation with the AfD’s core beliefs, a large majority opted for the latter.
The so-called traffic-light coalition suffered a crushing defeat, losing out to the conservative CDU/CSU opposition – a major blow for Social Democrat chancellor Olaf Scholz. No German government in recent years has been as unpopular as this one. On Sunday night, we began to hear the first demands for a vote of confidence. If Scholz’s rather indolent grin after learning the results is any indication, he will do no such thing. Still, with French president Emmanuel Macron calling for new elections and the German government appearing as weak as it did, the centre of Europe looks pretty shaky indeed.
The two issues that seem to have driven the further rise of the far right – migration and the rejection of the green agenda – stand in uneasy connection. It seems unpalatable to many people that the German Greens suggest we can stop the Earth from further warming, but it is impossible for us to exercise control over who enters the country. What seemed entirely doable, even mandatory, during the last European election in 2019 – remember Greta? Remember the Green Deal? – now apparently sounds to many voters like an elitist pipe dream. The fact that the German Greens are also Ukraine’s staunchest allies may well have contributed to the overwhelming success of the AfD in the east.
But, at least for the time being, the centre will hold. Not only is an overwhelming majority of Europeans in favour of non-authoritarian parties, Poland also shows that no triumph of the far right is carved in stone. It also seems highly unlikely that the far right will be able to overcome its deep divisions and form a coherent bloc in the European parliament. But the liberal middle has only been given a respite. If issues such as migration are not tackled more wisely, the next time things may look much more bleak.

Paul Taylor: Macron’s gamble may have blown open the doors to an extreme-right government
They didn’t look like bigots. Polite, friendly, cheerful, not dour or angry. Yet almost one in every two of the voters whose polling cards I stamped in the town of Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, where I live, voted either for Marine Le Pen’s hard-right anti-immigration National Rally (RN) (39.1% locally) or the even further right anti-Islam Reconquest (7%). Across southern France, Le Pen’s national populists scored sweeping victories in towns and countryside. Nationwide, the RN topped the poll by a mile with 31.5%.
The result prompted the president, Emmanuel Macron, whose centrist Renaissance party and its allies took a beating, finishing a distant second with 14.5%, to dissolve parliament and call a snap election in just three weeks’ time. “The rise of nationalists, of demagogues, is a danger for France,” he declared in a dramatic television address. Yet he may have opened the doors of power to them.
It’s a huge gamble, reminiscent of Jacques Chirac’s kamikaze dissolution of parliament in 1997, which backfired and left the Gaullist president a prisoner of a leftwing government. While Le Pen’s RN looks united and its lead candidate Jordan Bardella is France’s most popular politician, the pro-European centre right and centre left are splintered and may be unable to unite in a three-week campaign.
Under France’s two-round election system, the two top candidates in each constituency go forward to a run-off. Based on Sunday’s result, the RN is sure to reach the second round in most districts, and it is far from sure that a “republican front” – an alliance of parties that in the past agreed to block the far right – will back the alternative candidate. On the contrary, the RN may cut local deals not to oppose the conservative Republicans’ incumbents in return for backing RN candidates in other seats. Meanwhile, the left looks irreconcilably split, not least due to the abrasive personality of hard-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon.
Three days after commemorating the defeat of fascism on the 80th anniversary of D-day, France may be on the way to electing an extreme-right government.

Alberto Alemanno: The EU’s climate ambitions look set to become a collateral victim
These elections boiled down to 27 parallel ballots, so failed to provide a clear direction for the EU. Instead, they reveal a set of disaggregated, country-by-country trends, with contradictory results for the same political forces across the union.
Contrary to some alarmist headlines in the run-up, these EU elections have not given the EU away to the far right. Far-right, anti-establishment parties secured approximately 25% of the 720 seats in the EU parliament, but they won’t be able to unite and call the shots.
Instead, the pro-EU majority – which has run the EU over the past 50 years – holds. It should be able to form a parliamentary majority supporting the next European Commission and identify a clear set of political priorities for the next five years.
The question remains whether, and the extent to which, this pro-EU majority grouping will need to accept support to pass legislation, either from the left (such as from the reduced Greens) or the right, from Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy.
Far-right, anti-establishment parties may be in government – directly or indirectly – in a dozen EU member states, including founding states such as Italy and the Netherlands, where they have gained unprecedented respectability, but the same normalisation has not yet occurred at the EU level.
It is against this backdrop that the choice of the next EU Commission president will play out, as that individual will be called upon to shape a parliamentary majority that for the first time might not be permanent throughout the five-year cycle. Instead, we can expect the emergence of a new balance of power depending on the issue at hand.
If EU climate ambitions risk becoming a collateral victim of this process, it’s the broader EU traditionally integrationist agenda that is at stake. Enlargement of the union is likely to be slowed down or even paused under the far-right influence. The next long-term budget, due to be negotiated by the parliament in 2026, is set to shrink. This may create a dangerous gap between citizens’ expectations of the union’s ability to address big challenges and the means it has to do so.
This can only damage the EU’s credibility and benefit the new far-right political class among their nationalistic, Europhobic and xenophobic constituencies. From this perspective, these results look likely to accelerate the shift to the right that has already been taking place within and across the EU.

Wojciech Orliński: Euroscepticism has no future in Poland
In Poland the result was a personal triumph for Donald Tusk. The prime minister’s Civic Coalition came first, beating the nationalist populist Eurosceptic Law and Justice party, which governed Poland from 2015 to 2023. In Brussels, Tusk’s party sits with the centre-right European People’s party, which is now the strongest in the European parliament.
The campaign in Poland ran in the shadow of a migration crisis on the Polish-Belarusian border. The previous conservative government had tried to deal with it using harsh methods of questionable legality, pushing migrants back to Belarus by force. Once in power the liberals continued the same policy, drawing attacks from all sides for both hypocrisy and a lack of humanity. As it turned out, this did not hurt Tusk. On the contrary, it allowed him to play his favourite role: Mr Reasonable, who has little time for ideologies.
The far-right Konfederacja ended up in third place. On one hand, this is a huge gain for Konfederacja, which failed to gain any seats in European parliament in previous elections. On the other hand, it proves that Eurosceptic politicians face an uphill battle in Poland.
Jarosław Kaczyński, leader of Law and Justice, tried to ride a wave of anti-EU sentiment: supporting farmers’ protests, criticising migration policies, even denying climate change. Yet he did not dare to advocate the idea of “Polexit”. Even his die-hard supporters were confused about his attitude towards the EU. This was probably one of the reasons why he lost some voters to Konfederacja, which is also are far from being consistent about Polexit: some politicians in Konfederacja advocate it, some do not. A party called Polexit actually ran in this election, but they scored 0.2%. For what it’s worth, Polish voters want to remain in the EU.

Rosa Balfour: The EU will no longer lead on green policies and human rights
The three main outcomes I see from these results are: the centre-right has consolidated its position as the largest political grouping in Europe; the radical right has continued to rise; and the Greens have been severely punished.
The centrist parties are likely to form a workable coalition that will back Ursula von der Leyen for another term as president of the European Commission. During the next five years this coalition will need extra votes to pass legislation, but can do so without a firm alliance. From this standpoint, the EU should be governable.
But the EU’s two most important governments have suffered major setbacks. Leadership from France and Germany – and from EU member states in general – is urgently needed: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine threatens Europe’s security, the climate emergency threatens the planet’s future and Europe’s economy is falling behind those of the US and China.
But the French president, Emmanuel Macron, brought on some unusual drama by gambling on a snap election that will either force the parties other than Marine Le Pen’s National Rally to come together to oppose her, or test the ability of Le Pen’s party to go into government for the first time. In the latter case, the gamble is for the next presidential election, in 2027. In Germany, every party in Olaf Scholz’s governing coalition has been dealt a big blow. Despite a string of recent scandals, the far-right Alternative für Deutschland came in second place, trailing the conservative Christian Democrats.
Radical-right parties in the next European parliament are unlikely to be able to form a single cohesive grouping. Still, the fact that around a quarter of those who turned out to vote chose to support them suggests a general rightwards lurch among Europeans. This will be reflected in policy choices, even if a pro-EU majority holds.
The impact will be most felt on the EU’s flagship Green Deal, and the Greens, who have suffered big losses, will not be strong enough to oppose it. The anti-woke politics that seem to have played a role in these elections are now likely to be reflected in the European parliament, despite it being hitherto a key player in advancing civic rights in Europe and beyond. Migration policy has already been shaped by the radical right for the past decade. Any trace of the EU’s reputation as a global leader for green policies and human rights has been cast aside.

Cas Mudde: Remember, the far right doesn’t represent Europe’s people – far more of them reject it
The far right was the biggest winner overall, which was hardly a surprise: most opinion polls were pretty accurate. The liberals and Greens lost big. The two big “centrist” groups in the parliament, the rightwing European People’s party (EPP) and the leftwing Socialists and Democrats, respectively won and lost a bit. But European elections are a collection of 27 national elections and while there were significant changes in support at the national level, at European level the changes were surprisingly modest given the global and regional developments since the last European elections five years ago, from Brexit and Covid-19 to Ukraine.
What this means is that there is no clear European trend. In fact, sharp changes in major EU member states, most notably France and Germany, had a disproportionate impact.
So, even though the far right did well across most of Europe, it did less well than expected, performing particularly poorly in northern Europe. The Finns party and the Danish People’s party lost big, while the Sweden Democrats lost support. That loss was offset by the new rightwing populist party Denmark Democrats, although they also had a rather lacklustre result. Green and leftwing parties did well in the three Nordic countries, unlike in most of the rest of Europe.
In the Netherlands, just half a year after Geert Wilders shocked Europe by coming first in a general election, his Party for Freedom again won big, albeit behind the Labour party/GreenLeft, which surprisingly came in first. Moreover, the extreme-right Forum for Democracy, the big winner of 2019, was wiped out.
To be clear, there is little to celebrate in these results. Yes, the centre held, and the far right failed to gain as much as feared. But the far right did win about one in four seats and one in five votes in Europe. Moreover, the real question was never “will the centre hold?” but rather “which centre will hold?”. And in this respect, the elections tell a less positive story. After all, the biggest group in the new parliament, the EPP, adopted the key issues and frames of the far right in its campaign and will govern in a more rightwing manner than before – with or without the help of the divided far right.
To prevent a far-right turn in Brussels, with or without official coalitions with far-right parties, we need realistic rather than sensationalist analysis and reporting. It is important to be vigilant, but counterproductive to be defeatist. The far right does not represent “the people”. In fact, it represents just a minority of Europe’s peoples. Moreover, far more Europeans reject far-right parties and policies. This is the message progressives should continue to push, to and through the media, and ultimately towards the EPP, so that the centre will truly hold in the coming five years.

6159,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-08-26,"Paralympics: Transgender sprinter set to draw attentionAugust 26, 2024
""I often say, if I've done it, others can too. I hope to be the first of many, a reference point, an inspiration. My story can help many people, whether visually impaired, transgender, or not,"" Valentina Petrillo told press agency AFP, as interest in her participation grows ahead of the Paralympics opening ceremony on August 28.
Petrillo will compete in the T12 event for visually impaired athletes. She publicly came out as transgender in 2017 having narrowly missed out on the 1996 Atalanta Paralympic team as a male, but was not recognised as a woman by Italian authorities until 2023. Petrillo, 50, won two bronze medals in the 200 meter and 400 meter events at the 2023 World Athletics Championships.
Though Petrillo said she hopes to be ""the first of many"" transgender athletes competing at the games, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) say she will not be the first transgender Paralympian, as has been widely reported. A spokesperson for the organization told DW that Dutch discus thrower Ingrid van Kranen was the first, in Rio 2016.
Dutch discus thrower first trans Paralympian
Van Kranen came ninth in the discus final and made few waves internationally. In the intervening eight years, transgender issues have become a much more prominent point of discussion, often becoming a wedge issue in culture wars. Sport is often at the forefront of this.
The battle lines are well drawn but each case has its own nuances. For German para-athlete Katrin Müller-Rottgardt, who will run in the same category as Petrillo, the sporting stage poses difficulties that normal life does not.
""Everyone should live their everyday life the way they feel comfortable. But I find it difficult in competitive sports,"" she told German tabloid Bild.
""She (Petrillo) has lived and trained as a man for a long time, so there is a possibility that the physical requirements are different to those of someone who was born a woman. This could give her an advantage,"" the German athlete added.
The range of scientific and institutional views are fairly well-established but there is nothing like a consensus, with different sports and different governing bodies taking entirely different lines, even when dealing with the same athletes.
Imane Khelif caught in the middle
This became clear in the case of Olympic gold medal-winning boxer, Imane Khelif. After her Italian opponent walked away from Khelif's opening fight, her gender became one of the games' hot button topics. Khelif was incorrectly labelled transgender by media outlets and major public figures. Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting faced similar challenges.
The pair was initially banned from the 2023 championship, run by the International Boxing Association. The organization was later stripped of its status as the sport's global governing body, which allowed the boxers to fight in Paris after all.
The inconsistencies apparent between sports and events means that Petrillo would not be able to compete in the women's athletics at the Olympics, but can at the Paralympics. World Athletics, the global governing body for track and field athletics, banned transgender athletes from competing in 2023. But World Para Athletics says any person who is legally recognised as a woman is eligible to compete in the category their impairment qualifies them for. The IPC told DW that, for now at least, they leave such decisions up to individual federations.
""The IPC in its role as a major event organizer does not have any relevant rules addressing transgender and intersex athlete participation, as this is the responsibility of each International Federation,"" the spokesperson said.
High-profile names in legal case
There is no doubt that Petrillo is playing by the rules as they stand. But that is unlikely to prevent her being in the center of a storm, as Khelif was before her.
""I know there will be people who don't understand why I'm doing this, but I'm here, I've fought for years to get where I am, and I'm not afraid. This is who I am,"" said the athlete.
But the abuse faced by athletes in such cases is serious. After returning home to Algeria, Khelif announced that she had filed a lawsuit, reportedly against social media platform X, over alleged cyberbullying.
Khelif's lawyer, Nabil Boudi, told the entertainment magazine Variety that the complaint names X owner Elon Musk and Harry Potter author JK Rowling. Boudi added that he would also be considering any role played by former US president and current Republican candidate, Donald Trump.

3751,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-07-02,"The US will pay Moderna $176 million to develop an mRNA pandemic flu vaccine
The U.S. government will pay the vaccine maker Moderna $176 million to accelerate development of a pandemic influenza vaccine that could be used to treat bird flu in people, as concern grows about cases in dairy cows across the country, federal officials announced Tuesday.
Moderna already has a bird flu vaccine in very early-stage testing that uses the same mRNA technology that allowed rapid development and rollout of vaccines to protect against COVID-19. The new funds from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services include continued development of the vaccine, including a late-stage trial next year if those early study results are positive.
But the project can be quicky redirected to target another form of influenza if a different threat than the H5N1 form of bird flu emerges, HHS officials stressed.
The award was made through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, a program that focuses on medical treatments for potential pandemics.
The H5N1 virus was detected earlier this year in dairy cows and has spread to more than 135 herds in 12 states and infected three people to date, all with mild cases. Federal health officials stress that the risk to the wider population remains low.

2406,real,INSTITUTIONAL_AND_MEDIA_DISTRUST_PUBLIC_INSTITUTIONS,2024-05-29,"Global health leaders have said an international treaty governing how the world should deal with future pandemics may not be agreed for another year or more.
After two years of negotiations, countries failed to agree on the text of an international pandemic accord by a deadline of 24 May. And at the World Health Assembly in Geneva on Tuesday delegates said extensive further negotiations would be needed.
The accord contains a series of measures setting out how the world should prevent, prepare for and respond to pandemics. Setting out plans for a pandemic treaty in early 2021, world leaders described it as a legacy to protect their children and grandchildren.
The former chief scientific adviser to the government Sir Patrick Vallance is among those who have warned of the threat of another pandemic, saying earlier this month that it was “absolutely inevitable”.
During a debate, some countries – including many African nations – urged efforts to conclude the treaty negotiation process before the end of 2024, in order not to lose momentum.
Others, including the US, EU and Caribbean countries such as Jamaica, called for at least another year so that thorny issues could be properly addressed.
While member states had reached agreement on many areas, serious disagreements remain, including on finance; how much product pharmaceutical companies should be required to set aside for those countries most in need; intellectual property rights and sanctions.
One leading issue has been on what access to drugs and treatments developing countries can expect in return for their efforts monitoring and sharing information on pathogens found in their territories.
The negotiations have also been the subject of widespread misinformation campaigns, with false claims that the treaty represents a power grab by the World Health Organization, giving them the ability to impose lockdowns on countries.
A large blue bus was seen driving around Geneva urging people to “say no to the pandemic treaty”.
Earlier on Tuesday, Roland Driece, who had been the co-chair of the intergovernmental negotiating body, told a panel discussion on the treaty that the issues still to be resolved were “really politically sensitive and difficult”, and suggested more than a few months of additional negotiation would be needed.
Driece warned there was a risk of a sense of urgency slipping as time got further from the pandemic and other international issues came to the fore, but said: “We all have to realise we started with nothing. We started with a blank piece of paper.”
He said all the necessary elements were on the table “if countries want to work with them”.
Parallel negotiations on how to amend International Health Regulations (IHR) from 2005 to strengthen health systems facing pandemics are thought to be closer to an agreement, and many countries are pushing for a final decision on amendments to be reached this week.
In a statement on Tuesday night, the WHO said work would continue until the end of the assembly on 1 June to complete the package of amendments to the IHR, and agree the timing, format and process to conclude the pandemic agreement.
Michel Kazatchkine, a former member of the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, said: “The good news is that all countries want to continue. But we cannot wait for the accord to be agreed to accelerate pandemic preparedness at country and regional levels. Hopefully, important amendments to the IHR will be adopted at the end of the week.”"

Ukraine mourns as rescuers search the rubble of a Kyiv children’s hospital struck by a missile
Rescue operations stretched into a second day in Kyiv following deadly Russian strikes in the Ukrainian capital on Monday.
The 10-story hospital, which is Ukraine’s largest medical facility for children, was caring for some 675 patients at the time of the attack. The missile hit a two-story wing of the hospital. Rescuers searched the rubble at the hospital for more dead and wounded, a day after Russian missiles slammed into the facility and cities across the country in a massive daytime barrage. The death toll from the strikes rose to 42, officials said.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Rescuers searched the rubble of Ukraine’s biggest children’s hospital on Tuesday for more dead and wounded, a day after authorities say a Russian missile leveled a wing of the Kyiv facility during a massive daytime barrage that killed at least 42 people throughout the country.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on the social platform X that 64 people were hospitalized in the capital, in addition to 28 in Kryvyi Rih and six in Dnipro — both cities in central Ukraine.
It was Russia’s heaviest bombardment of Kyiv in almost four months and one of the deadliest of the war, hitting seven of the capital’s 10 districts, according to Ukrainian officials. The strike on the Okhmatdyt children’s hospital, which interrupted open-heart surgery and forced young cancer patients to take their treatments outdoors, drew international condemnation.
The 10-story hospital, Ukraine’s largest medical facility for children, was caring for 627 patients at the time of the attack, according to the country’s health minister.
“The building where we conducted dialysis for children with kidney failure or acute intoxication is ruined entirely,” the hospital’s director general, Volodymyr Zhovnir, told reporters, estimating the overall damage at $2.5 million.
Danielle Bell, the head of a United Nations team tracking human rights violations in Ukraine, said at least two people were killed at the hospital and about 50 were injured, including seven children. There would have been a lot more casualties if patients hadn’t been taken to a bunker when air raid sirens first sounded, she added.
Zhovnir said one of the two people killed at the hospital was a female doctor who had taken children to the shelter before going back to check whether anyone had been left behind.
Pediatric surgeon Oleh Holubchenko told The Associated Press he was operating on a baby with congenital face defects and that he and his team decided to continue despite the blast of air sirens. “We couldn’t stop halfway through,” he said.
The missile strike’s shock wave sent him hurtling across the operating theater. Shrapnel caused him minor injuries and pierced the infant’s ventilator. The baby, still with an open wound, had to be transported to another Kyiv hospital, where they finished the surgery.
Authorities were working to restore the hospital’s power and water supply as Kyiv city administrators declared Tuesday an official day of mourning. Entertainment events were prohibited and flags were lowered in the capital.
U.N. Security Council members confronted Russia over the hospital strike, condemning Moscow during an emergency meeting Tuesday chaired by the Russian ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia.
Russia denied responsibility, insisting it doesn’t attack civilian targets in Ukraine despite abundant evidence to the contrary, including AP reporting. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov pointed to a Russian Defense Ministry statement that blamed the hospital strike on a Ukrainian air defense missile.
Nebenzia repeated that position during the Security Council meeting, saying: “If this had been a Russian strike, there would have been nothing left of the building,”
Bell, the head of the U.N. team, dismissed the Russian argument. She said an assessment of video footage and findings on site indicated the hospital “took a direct hit, rather than receiving damage due to an intercepted weapons system.”
The hospital likely was struck by a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile, Bell said. Ukrainian officials said the same.
Investigators with the International Criminal Court in The Hague visited the hospital Tuesday to collect evidence for possible war crimes charges, the court said. Hospitals, along with other civilian sites, are protected under international humanitarian law.
Pope Francis on Tuesday expressed his “great sorrow” about the hospital attack and his “deep shock” at the escalation of violence.
Over the past year, Moscow has been honing tactics to break through Ukraine’s air defenses, said Alexander Kovalenko, a military analyst from Information Resistance, a Kyiv-based think tank.
Russia used a large number of various types of missiles Monday that, arriving together, made it hard for Ukrainian air defenses to intercept them, he said.
“They have been experimenting with different kinds of rockets since 2023 to find the perfect combination to break through our air defense algorithms,” Kovalenko told the AP.
Russian forces have also programmed missiles to maneuver mid-air, according to Kovalenko, who added that during Monday’s attack, a missile first appeared to be heading farther west before it swerved back to strike Kyiv.
The bodies of three more people were found Tuesday under the rubble of a residential building in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kyiv, officials said, bringing the death toll in the single building to 10.
The Russian onslaught Monday came on the eve of a NATO summit in Washington where alliance countries are expected to pledge new military and economic support for Ukraine.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, was hosting India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Moscow. New Delhi’s importance as a key trading partner has grown since the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022.
Zelenskyy was deeply critical of Modi’s visit, saying on X late Monday: “It is a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world’s largest democracy hug the world’s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day.”
Meanwhile, Russian military and regional officials said Tuesday that Ukrainian drones targeted six Russian regions overnight, in what appeared to be a bigger-than-usual aerial attack by Kyiv’s forces.
Russia’s Defense Ministry said air defense systems in five Russian southern and western regions “destroyed and intercepted” a total of 38 Ukrainian drones.

Known as one of the most fierce anti-globalist leaders in Europe, Fico has consistently called for an end to the war in Ukraine, and in recent months has provided staunch opposition to the WHO Pandemic Treaty, playing a leading role in stopping the globalist organization from forcing through the legislation.

The Slovakian prime minister also angered the WEF when he ordered an investigation into the COVID-19 response and mRNA vaccine roll out.
Fico warned his supporters that his life was in danger after these moves, however the assassination attempt came as an enormous shock in Slovakia.
According to emerging details in The Associated Press, Fico “was injured in a shooting and taken to hospital. The incident took place in the town of Handlova, some 150 kilometers northeast of the capital, according to the news television station TA3.”
Local authorities say that a suspect is in custody. The shooting happened in front of the House of Culture where a government meeting was taking place.
One eyewitness “saw the prime minister being lifted from the ground by security guards and loaded into a car and driven away.”
Video of the immediate aftermath:
The Globalists are trying to eliminate all resistance to their agenda.
A national outlet in Slovakia has reported the following details of his condition:
According to the available information, which immediately began to spread, Prime Minister Robert Fico was hit by 2-3 wounds, allegedly in the limb, chest and abdomen. It is said that up to 4-5 shots should have been fired. According to information from the PLUS 7 DAYS weekly , someone from the crowd called out “Robo, come here” and the shooting started.
“It’s a gunshot wound to the abdomen and arm. He’s currently out of danger. They’re going to operate on him,” our well-informed source told us at 3:30 p.m."
5696,fake,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-04-25,"The country is currently grappling with a shortage of troops as they continue to battle Russia and hold the front line. The Russian army is currently much larger and better equipped than its Ukrainian counterpart, and Ukraine appears to be fighting a losing battle.
Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba explained the motivation for the measures in a statement on X, writing: ""How it looks like now: a man of conscription age went abroad, showed his state that he does not care about its survival, and then comes and wants to receive services from this state. It does not work this way. Our country is at war. Staying abroad does not relieve a citizen of his or her duties to the Homeland.""
The foreign ministry will be clarifying what military-aged men need to do to obtain consular services soon, but it is almost certain they will be forced to return home. A published letter indicated Ukrainian consulates will only issue documents to men in this age range abroad that enable them to return home to Ukraine, and the consulates in Prague and Barcelona have already stopped offering services to men of military age.
The state passport service issued a statement of its own indicating it cannot help Ukrainians abroad, saying: ""Unfortunately, due to technical reasons, the issuance of ready-made documents in foreign branches of SE (State Enterprise) Document has been suspended.""

According to the Eurostat database, around 4.3 million Ukrainians are currently registered in EU countries. Around 20% of them, or 860,000, are adult men.
Right now, Ukrainian men who are younger than 60 are forbidden from traveling abroad under martial law, but many are trying to avoid the draft by either attempting to bribe officials or by hiding somewhere within the country.
The move comes as a controversial new law is set to go into effect next month requiring men of military age to report to draft offices in the country to update their papers within a period of 60 days; those who are abroad would need these papers if they want to obtain consular services.
They also recently lowered the age of mobilization by two years from to age 27 to 25 in an effort to boost the military's depleted ranks. It is believed the new law, which also eliminated certain draft exemptions and toughened the penalties for draft dodgers, could add around 50,000 troops to the country’s military, as some of those in this age range may be unfit for service, have deferment rights, or already be part of the reserve.
This is only a fraction of the 500,000 troops that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he wanted to mobilize in December, although he later said that the figure was incorrect. Their troops reportedly numbered 800,000 in October, including around 300,000 serving on the front lines.
Military analysts report that the average age of soldiers on both sides is above 40.
There are some concerns that reducing the minimum conscription age means that more young adults will be forced out of the workforce, which could add to the country’s economic problems. However, with Russian forces expected to launch a major push in the coming weeks or months, Kiev is reportedly looking to bolster its troop numbers using whatever means possible.

5512,fake,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-10-09,"10/09/2024 / By Ethan Huff
The planet is warming at too fast a rate for Forbes writer Nils Rokke who wrote an article for the rag that calls for gas prices across America to double in order to stop climate change.
Whatever Rokke is fearful about constitutes “a present-day emergency” in his mind, which means that “we must use every tool at our disposal to combat it,” including by forcing Americans to spend $10 per gallon of gas just to live.
Like the rest of the climate lunatics, Rokke is convinced that carbon, the basis of all life on earth, is evil and must be eradicated. This includes carbon dioxide (CO2), an element that plants need in order to live.
In Rokke’s mind, the “social cost of carbon” is simply too high to allow Americans to continue spending any less than $10 per gallon of gas. Higher gas prices, according to Rokke, will cure global warming.
(Related: Oil prices are already surging due to insiders overhearing Joe Biden the other day “discussing” military attacks on Iranian oil facilities.)
As part of his argument, Rokke cited some bogus study that claims, without any evidence, that a “1°C warming reduces world GDP by 12%.” Since Rokke believes that carbon contributes to warming, he wants everyone who drives a car to be punished.
Rokke says that the “real social cost” of carbon is “approximately $9 per U.S. gallon.” To implement that cost “would more than double current prices,” he admits.
“This would be deeply unpopular, yet it’s a sobering reality: fuel taxation is the only area where we’re even close to covering the full social cost of carbon emissions,” Rokke writes.
As usual, Rokke also threw in a few tidbits about how the “vulnerable” and people with the “least resources” will be most punished by $10 per gallon gas while the rich will not even notice the change except that perhaps there will be a lot fewer poor people on America’s roadways, leaving plenty of room for the rich and famous to rule everything.
“The reality is that paying the full social cost of carbon seems unfeasible, but mounting evidence shows that the costs of inaction are even higher,” Rokke claims.
In other words, making driving too expensive for most Americans to continue doing, which will effectively reward the rich by clearing the roadways and airways of all the unwashed masses, is how Rokke plans to solve climate change.
“The time to act is now – before we reach the tipping point where recovery is no longer possible,” Rokke concludes his fearmongering piece in promotion of a climate-driven class war centered around depriving most people of their freedom to drive.
In the comments, someone wrote that Rokke and all others like him should just hold their breath until they die “to stop CO2 emissions and pay the social cost of breathing.”
“A personal CO2 reclamation device should work,” joked another. “Also known as a plastic bag.”
“Big Business used to be seen as greedy but sane. Now, they have fully surrendered,” wrote another about the rot that has destroyed every element of what made America at least a decent place to live. “They are on board with the pedo-Marxist globalist agenda.”
“They are worse than the psychopaths of the American Left. They know better, but they are greedy, unprincipled, cowardly and short-sighted. The enablers of psychopaths will face a harsher judgement than the psychopaths themselves.”
“Nils Rokke is Greta Thunberg in a business suit,” wrote another. “A corrupt, brainwashed Scandinavian and nothing more.”

GENEVA (AP) — The U.N. weather agency is sounding a “red alert” about global warming, citing record-smashing increases last year in greenhouse gases, land and water temperatures and melting of glaciers and sea ice, and is warning that the world’s efforts to reverse the trend have been inadequate.
The World Meteorological Organization said there is a “high probability” that 2024 will be another record-hot year.
The Geneva-based agency, in a “State of the Global Climate” report released Tuesday, ratcheted up concerns that a much-vaunted climate goal is increasingly in jeopardy: That the world can unite to limit planetary warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial levels.
“Never have we been so close – albeit on a temporary basis at the moment – to the 1.5° C lower limit of the Paris agreement on climate change,” said Celeste Saulo, the agency’s secretary-general. “The WMO community is sounding the red alert to the world.”
The 12-month period from March 2023 to February 2024 pushed beyond that 1.5-degree limit, averaging 1.56 C (2.81 F) higher, according to the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Service. It said the calendar year 2023 was just below 1.5 C at 1.48 C (2.66 F), but a record hot start to this year pushed beyond that level for the 12-month average.
“Earth’s issuing a distress call,” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. “The latest State of the Global Climate report shows a planet on the brink. Fossil fuel pollution is sending climate chaos off the charts.”
Omar Baddour, WMO’s chief of climate monitoring, said the year after an El Niño event — the cyclical warming of the Pacific Ocean that affects global weather patterns — normally tends to be warmer.
“So we cannot say definitively about 2024 is going to be the warmest year. But what I would say: There is a high probability that 2024 will again break the record of 2023, but let’s wait and see,” he said. “January was the warmest January on record. So the records are still being broken.”
The latest WMO findings are especially stark when compiled in a single report. In 2023, over 90% of ocean waters experienced heat wave conditions at least once. Glaciers monitored since 1950 lost the most ice on record. Antarctic sea ice retreated to its lowest level ever.
“Topping all the bad news, what worries me the most is that the planet is now in a meltdown phase — literally and figuratively given the warming and mass loss from our polar ice sheets,” said Jonathan Overpeck, dean of the University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability, who wasn’t involved in the report.
Saulo called the climate crisis “the defining challenge that humanity faces” and said it combines with a crisis of inequality, as seen in growing food insecurity and migration.
WMO said the impact of heatwaves, floods, droughts, wildfires and tropical cyclones, exacerbated by climate change, was felt in lives and livelihoods on every continent in 2023.
“This list of record-smashing events is truly distressing, though not a surprise given the steady drumbeat of extreme events over the past year,” said University of Arizona climate scientist Kathy Jacobs, who also wasn’t involved in the WMO report. “The full cost of climate-change-accelerated events across sectors and regions has never been calculated in a meaningful way, but the cost to biodiversity and to the quality of life of future generations is incalculable.”
But the U.N. agency also acknowledged “a glimmer of hope” in trying to keep the Earth from running too high a fever. It said renewable energy generation capacity from wind, solar and waterpower rose nearly 50% from 2022 — to a total of 510 gigawatts.
“The target of 1.5C degree warming still holds, just like a speed limit on the highway still holds even if we temporarily exceed it,” said Malte Meinshausen, a professor of climate science at the University of Melbourne in Australia. “What is more urgent than ever is to grasp the economic opportunities that arise due to the low-cost renewables at our disposal, to decarbonize the electricity sector, and electrify other sectors.”
“We need to step on the brakes of ever-increasing GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions,” said Meinshausen, who also was not involved in the report. “And hopeful signs are there, that GHG emissions are about to peak.”
The report comes as climate experts and government ministers are to gather in the Danish capital, Copenhagen, on Thursday and Friday to press for greater climate action, including increased national commitments to fight global warming.
“Each year the climate story gets worse; each year WMO officials and others proclaim that the latest report is a wake-up call to decision makers,” said University of Victoria climate scientist Andrew Weaver, a former British Columbia lawmaker.
“Yet each year, once the 24-hour news cycle is over, far too many of our elected ‘leaders’ return to political grandstanding, partisan bickering and advancing policies with demonstrable short-term outcomes,” he said. “More often than not everything else ends up taking precedence over the advancement of climate policy. And so, nothing gets done.”

The number of people globally who have received certain vaccines has still not returned to pre-pandemic levels, according to a new joint report of estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
Estimates of coverage of the first dose of the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine (DTP) and the measles-containing vaccine (MCV) remained stable from 2022 to 2023 – higher than rates during the pandemic but lower than pre-pandemic estimates, according to the report, which was published on Sunday evening.
Additionally, an estimated 21 million children missed one or more vaccines in 2023, about 2.7 million more than seen in 2019.
""The global immunization coverage has stagnated, or it is stalling,"" Dr. Ephrem T. Lemango, associate director of immunization at UNICEF, told ABC News. ""It's not really recovering as quick as we want.""
For the report, WHO and UNICEF researchers reviewed vaccination coverage data submitted from more than 190 countries and performed analyses, with consideration of potential biases and local expert opinion, to produce global and country-specific estimates.
One of the major findings of the report was that, for estimates of when infants received the first dose of the DTP vaccine, 89% of infants did so in 2023, which is the same percentage as in 2022. However, this year's percentage is lower than the 90% of infants in 2019 who received the first dose, the report found.
Estimated coverage for the third dose of the DTP vaccine also remained unchanged at 84% from 2022 to 2023, but lower than the 86% in 2019 who received all three doses of the vaccine.
Lemango said although DTP coverage is stalling, it is nonetheless approaching pre-pandemic levels and is higher than coverage seen during the pandemic.
""We can safely say that, even though it feels very slow, we are on a path to recovery, which is basically going back to pre-pandemic levels,"" he said.
Additionally, the number of children of who were unvaccinated against DTP increased from an estimated 13.9 million in 2022 to 14.5 million in 2023. Nigeria had the highest absolute number of children who had not received a single dose of the DTP vaccine during that time, followed by India, according to the report.
The report also found that not all children who began their vaccine schedule finished it. In 2023, an estimated 6.5 million children globally did not complete their follow-up doses of the DTP vaccine, which is higher than the 5.5 million children that missed follow up doses in 2019.
The report also looked at coverage of the MCV vaccine, which protects against measles. Lemango explained that measles is a highly contagious disease and, because it spreads so quickly, it acts as a ""canary in the coalmine,"" revealing potential gaps in immunity coverage.
""So, if you see measles outbreaks increasing across countries, it shows you these are the areas where there is an immunity gap and, if you can identify these areas, you will usually also end up realizing these children are also not getting other vaccines, and, most likely, they are not even getting other health services,"" he said.
The first dose of MCV is recommended at 9 months old in countries with ongoing transmission of measles, and at 12 months old in countries with low risk of transmission, according to a WHO-funded study.
Similar to DTP, the estimated percentage of children who received the first dose of MCV was unchanged from 2022 to 2023, at 83%, lower than the 86% in 2019 who received a first dose.
Additionally, an estimated 22.2 million children in 2023 missed their routine first dose of measles vaccine, according to the report.
However, there were some positive signs in the report. In 2023, coverage of the first dose of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine among females increased from 20% in 2022 to 27% in 2023, while coverage of the last dose increased from under 15% in 2022 to 20% in 2023.
HPV has been linked to numerous cancers, including head and neck, throat, penile, cervical and rectal cancer. Receiving the HPV vaccine has been shown to prevent cancers caused by the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
To drive increased vaccine coverage, Lemango said organizations need to make sure vaccine delivery service continues even during conflicts, which is one of the major drivers of missing vaccinations. Countries also need to ensure they're keeping their vaccine stockpiles supplied, he said.
Lastly, Lemango said organizations need to continue to improve and maintain vaccine confidence.
""In so many places, vaccine confidence – such as mistrust in the system, mistrust in the vaccines and mistrust in the people who deliver these vaccines – tends to affect the overall uptake of any vaccine,"" he said. ""So, we need to make sure that we build systems that are able to be trusted by the community. As workers, we need to continue to provide the right and complete information to parents."""
4215,real,ANTI_MIGRATION_AND_XENOPHOBIA,2024-10-14,"The French government will propose a new immigration law in 2025 that will extend the period during which migrants in an irregular situation and deemed dangerous can be held in administrative detention, government spokeswoman Maud Bregeon said on Sunday.
The last immigration law, which came into force in January 2024, was the subject of heated debate. The party of President Emmanuel Macron, which had a relative majority at the time, pushed through the law due to the far-right National Rally's abstention, though some of the proposals put forward by the right-wing MPs were rejected by the Constitutional Council.
For 2025, however, “there will be a need for a new immigration law’ in 2025,” said government spokeswoman Maud Bregeon on Sunday morning on BFM TV.
This time, the new government, led by Prime Minister Michel Barnier and with the influential right-wing Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau (LR, Les Républicains), wants to reverse the law.
Since taking office, Retailleau has advocatesd stricter EU rules and an overhaul of Schengen area rules. On Thursday in Luxembourg, he even urged his EU counterparts to implement the asylum and immigration pact, currently scheduled for 2026.
Longer detention periodsAccording to the government spokeswoman, the new text would consider Retailleau's proposal to ‘facilitate the extension of detention of illegal foreign nationals who present dangerous profiles in administrative detention centres’.
This would extend detention from a maximum of 90 days to 210 days - a proposal put forward by right-wing MPs from Laurent Wauquiez's Droite républicaine group at the end of September.
Bregeon also warned that the government's next text could include elements condemned by the Constitutional Council in the last law - such as tightening up on family reunification. She also spoke of including the regularisation of undocumented workers in areas with a severe labour shortage.
“We're not stopping ourselves from thinking about other provisions that could be proposed in this law,” added Bregeon.
The text will be discussed with the National Assembly and Senate parliamentary groups.
“We will not be seeking the support of the Rassemblement National,” she warned.
The Rassemblement National, which abstained last time, has already made its refusal to censure the Barnier government conditional on the drafting of a new immigration law.

5978,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-10-18,"South Korea claims Pyongyang began moving special forces to Russia earlier this month, days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy made a similar accusation that North Korea had sent soldiers and weapons to help support the Kremlin in its war against Ukraine.
South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) said in a statement on October 18 that it had tracked the movements of the North's military from October 8 to October 13 and had captured images of North Korea transporting special forces to Russian territory via a Russian transport ship, the first time a Russian Navy vessel had been detected entering North Korean waters since 1990, ""confirming the start of the North Korean military's participation in the war.""
""The North Korean soldiers dispatched to Russia are currently stationed at Russian military bases in the Far East, including Vladivostok, Ussuriisk, Khabarovsk, and Blagoveshchensk, and are expected to be deployed to the front lines as soon as they complete their adaptation training,"" the NIS statement said.
""The North Korean soldiers were issued Russian military uniforms and Russian-made weapons, and were also issued fake ID cards of residents of the Yakutia and Buryatia regions of Siberia who looked similar to North Koreans. It appears that they disguised themselves as Russian soldiers to hide the fact that they were deployed to the battlefield,"" it added.

The statement included maps and photos purportedly backing up the claims, which have not been independently verified.
Speculation over North Korea's role in the conflict has grown amid signs of tightening relations between Moscow and countries such as North Korea and Iran almost 32 months after Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine was launched.
The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based U.S. military think tank, also recently reported that several thousand North Korean troops had arrived in Russia and were being prepared for deployment in Ukraine.
The Kremlin has previously dismissed claims by South Korea that Pyongyang has supplied artillery shells and short-range missiles to Moscow, but has not commented on the latest assertions by either Seoul or Zelenskiy, who on October 14 said that ""this is no longer just about transferring weapons. It is actually about transferring people from North Korea to the occupying military forces.""
The NIS statement said Ukrainian intelligence services had analyzed North Korean weapons it says Russia has used in the war and found they have ""a high defect rate and low accuracy, so they are being used for mass offensives to maintain the front line rather than for precision strikes.""
NATO chief Mark Rutte, speaking in Brussels on October 18, said the military alliance could not confirm the reports that North Korean troops were ""actively engaged"" in the conflict in Ukraine.
Defense ministers from NATO's 32 members are meeting to discuss developments in Ukraine, as well as other issues.
In Washington, the chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee cited the South Korean report in a letter to President Joe Biden calling for an immediate classified briefing on the issue.
""These [North Korean] troops movements, if true, are alarming and are an extreme escalation of the conflict in Ukraine,"" said Representative Mike Turner (Republican-Ohio). ""They require an immediate response from the United States and our NATO allies to avoid a widening conflict."

The reason why everything costs an arm and a leg these days is because the planet is “warming” too much, according to a new study cited by the Biden regime as a self-explanatory cause of inflation.
President Biden alleges that climate change, Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) “pandemic” are all to blame for sky-high prices – not the private Federal Reserve’s money-printing extravaganzas coupled with fractional-reserve banking and a corrupt Wall Street.
“We find a rich response of inflation in different price aggregates to fluctuations in a variety of weather conditions,” the new study states. “The strongest and most consistent signal arises from fluctuations in average monthly temperatures.”
“Although larger in food prices, these impacts also translate into considerable effects on headline inflation. We find limited evidence for impacts on other price sub-components asides from weak evidence in the electricity sector.”
Over the next decade, Biden says food inflation could increase by as much as 3 percent annually due to the warming planet, especially during times of excess heat like in summertime. The warmer the planet gets, the more expensive things get, according to Biden.
Evidence of Biden’s claims supposedly can be found in Europe where food inflation was particularly high during the hot, hot summer of 2022. Come 2035, food inflation will get even worse as temperatures increase even more.
(Related: Last Christmas, Biden declared that inflation is “over” and that all companies need to immediately lower their prices to reflect it.)

Economists, meanwhile, are trying to figure out if Biden and the new study’s authors are serious or if this is just an April Fool’s joke.
“Inflation is a monetary issue,” says Ryan Young, a senior economist for the Competitive Enterprise Institute. “The earth’s average temperature does not affect the amount of currency in circulation.”
“Climate change policies, rather than climate change itself, do tend to increase inflation. They do this by increasing deficit spending, which central banks are more or less obligated to finance … Typical climate change policies have an additional, smaller effect on inflation by reducing productivity. Green products are often less durable and less efficient, and they take up investment dollars that could have gone to other uses.”
Truth be told, there is now $5 trillion more in circulation in the United States compared to January 2020 just prior to the COVID “pandemic.” This, it turns out, is one of the major factors driving inflation today.
Many believe that the COVID “pandemic” was launched precisely because the U.S. economy was on the precipice due to decades of money-printing and Wall Street corruption. The powers that be unleashed the COVID “pandemic” to create a smokescreen for their collapsing financial empire, which continues to be upheld today by smoke and mirrors.
Until the money changers are removed from controlling the U.S. money supply, and until real money returns to replace the fake Monopoly-style “money” in circulation today, inflation and other consequences of central banking financial terrorism will continue.
Since Biden took office, the consumer price index (CPI) has increased by 18.5 percent. In response, the Biden regime has announced “the most ambitious climate agenda in history” to supposedly put a stop to it.
It turns out that said climate agenda is only making matters worse as it pumps even more cash into “green” initiatives that are unsustainable and highly disruptive to the economy.
“It is the solutions to climate change that drive up prices,” says Diana Furchtgott-Roth, director of the Heritage Foundation’s Center for Energy, Climate and Environment.
“Intermittent electricity, with wind and solar powering on and off with the wind blowing and the sun shining, and then backed up with gas that kicks in when wind and sun stop generating energy, is more expensive than continuous energy. That’s why electricity bills are rising.”

3727,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-09-26,"Covid is on the rise in England, and experts have warned that more must be done to prevent and control infections after a “capitulation to the virus”.
Prof Danny Altmann, an immunologist at Imperial College London, said those working in the field were perplexed by the current attitude to the battle against Covid, as the latest figures showed an increase in hospital admissions.
The latest data for England from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) showed that hospital admissions increased to 3.71 per 100,000 population for the week between 16 and 22 September 2024, compared with 2.56 per 100,000 the previous week.
The percentage of people with symptoms who have tested positive for Covid, based on tests at sentinel “spotter” laboratories, has also risen in the last week to 11.8% compared with 9.1% in the previous week.
Altmann described the prevailing stance on the virus as a “capitulation”. “To those who work in this field, the current attitude of acceptance to losing this war of attrition against Covid is puzzling and a little desperate,” he said.
“The data, both in the UK and US, show that the current Omicron subvariants are hugely successful at punching through any dwindling population immunity, so that we tolerate huge prevalence of around 12%. Our capitulation to the virus is a combination of a population where most are now many months or years from their last vaccine dose, and that vaccine dose was in any case poorly cross-protective for the very distinct current variants.
“Clearly, there is behavioural polarisation between those who are worried by this and look for mitigation, and those who think we must learn live with it and paid too high a price for our earlier measures,” he said.
Dr Simon Williams, from Swansea University, added that surveys suggest there is also a large group of people who are not thinking much about Covid at all. “Part of this is psychological – for two to three years it was something people had to think about all the time and is something that for many had many negative memories and feelings attached to it,” he said.
While Altmann said debate around measures needed to be properly informed and data-driven and to avoid extreme stances, it was important not to trivialise the impact of the virus.
“Those at the weaker end of the immune response spectrum may often experience four or more breakthrough infections per year. These may range from mild to those needing several days off work, with all the associated economic costs, plus any additional NHS burden,” he said.
Altmann also stressed the impact of long Covid, noting that it is thought to affect around 400 million people globally – with 3% lost workforce and a global cost estimate of $1tn annually – and can arise even in vaccinated people following reinfection.
The latest Covid data comes as a new variant is expected to become prevalent in the coming months. Known as XEC, it was first identified in Germany over the summer, and cases have already been identified in the UK. It is thought to have emerged from two other Covid variants, themselves descended from the BA.2.86 variant.
However, experts have said that, at present, XEC is not thought to cause different symptoms from previous variants and does not appear to be fuelling a surge in cases. It is also expected that Covid vaccinations and past infections will continue to offer protection against severe disease.
While bookings for the NHS autumn Covid booster jabs opened this week, Altmann said they should be offered more widely, together with increased use of lateral flow testing to avoid the spread of Covid.
Williams added that it was strange that more had not been done to clean indoor air and improve ventilation in public spaces including schools.
But while he backed offering boosters more widely, he also raised concerns: “I worry that again this autumn we will see a relatively low uptake of the booster among priority groups, including younger adults with a compromised immune system.”"

The psychological operations continue to ramp up to create a sense of urgency and fear required to market smallpox vaccines to Africa as mpox vaccines. But all is not as it seems, not least of all when it comes to distinguishing between the virus that causes “mpox” and the virus that causes smallpox.
Let’s not lose touch…Your Government and Big Tech are actively trying to censor the information reported by The Exposé to serve their own needs. Subscribe now to make sure you receive the latest uncensored news in your inbox…
On Friday, former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown published an article in The Guardian dramatically titled ‘Another worldwide alert – mpox is spreading. Here are three steps we can take to head it off’. The three steps Brown suggested were:
- First, thousands of available vaccines could be released now. The Africa CDC estimates that the continent may need as many as 10 million doses to end the outbreak.
- Second, the burden can be shared, and the cost of the two doses of the vaccine people need can be negotiated downwards.
- Third, we must ramp up our manufacturing capacity to ensure more supply of vaccines.
So, there is only one solution – vaccines, which makes Brown look very much like a vaccine salesman.
So far, “615 people have lost their lives this year in the DRC, where 90% of cases in Africa have been recorded.” Brown wrote.
The number of 615 deaths is according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (“UNHCR”) on 27 August as quoted by the World Health Organisation (“WHO”), which states “615 deaths to date.” UNHCR doesn’t state when the start date for the cumulative figure begins. But let’s take Brown’s word for it that it began at the beginning of this year.
Assuming the number of deaths is roughly evenly spread, and if 615 are suspected to have died with or from mpox in 8 months, then the annual equivalent would be 923. According to Our World in Data (the latest data is for 2021) this would mean that suspected cases of mpox are the 8th from the bottom cause of death, with fewer deaths than each of suicide, drowning, nutritional deficiencies, conflicts and terrorism, homicide, fire and poisonings.
The comparison is far from perfect because we’re oversimplifying the estimation of annual deaths and comparing them to data from almost three years ago. However, it does put Brown’s scaremongering into context nonetheless.
Other points Brown omitted from his article are how cases are determined, and how these numbers compare to the total population and all-cause mortality.
A the time of writing, based on Worldometer’s elaboration of the latest United Nations data, the population of the Democratic Republic of Congo (“DRC”) was 109,880,327 or approaching 110 million. Worldometer doesn’t have a population figure for 2021, but for 2020 it estimated DRC’s population at 96 million and in 2022, more than 102 million. That means there are relatively a high number of deaths in an average year. Indeed, in 2021, Our World in Data noted that 603,016 people died in the DRC from all causes.
Again, the comparison to the 615 people suspected to have died from mpox this year is less than perfect, but again it puts Brown’s scaremongering into context.
We have referred to suspected cases and suspected mpox deaths because, as we noted in a previous article, testing capacity is low in the DRC and most cases are not confirmed by lab testing. “So, we’ll have to rely on ‘suspected cases’, based on a clinical definition, to keep track of the epidemic,” C Raina MacIntyre, an Australian Professor of Global Biosecurity, wrote in The Conversation.
On Sunday a week ago, the World Health Organisation (“WHO”) advertised the symptoms of mpox on its Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean (“EMRO”) Twitter profile.
EMRO is one of six WHO regional offices worldwide and serves 22 countries and territories in West Asia, North Africa, the Horn of Africa and Central Asia. It’s not clear why EMRO is actively responding to the mpox outbreak. It must simply be because the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (“Africa CDC”) officially declared the mpox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security (“PHECS”) on 13 August.
As we noted in our article, these symptoms are not particular to mpox. Apart from similarities to a vaccinia virus infection, vaccinia virus being one of the components of the Jynneos smallpox vaccine being repurposed for mpox, MacIntyre noted similarities to symptoms of chickenpox and that a diagnosis of chickenpox does not rule out the person having mpox at the same time.
The other viral infection that has similar symptoms to mpox is smallpox. Smallpox is caused by the Variola virus. Symptoms of an infection typically start with fever, headache and swollen lymph nodes, followed by a rash with fluid-filled lesions. Mpox symptoms begin with fever, headache and swollen lymph nodes, then progress to a rash. Both viruses are Orthopoxviruses.
It’s not only the symptoms that are the same; the mpox virus is so similar to the smallpox virus that they are the same virus.
Yet, in 1980 after aggressive vaccination programmes throughout which “WHO played a critical role,” WHO declared smallpox eradicated – the only infectious disease to achieve this distinction. “This remains among the most notable and profound public health successes in history,” WHO boasts.
Mpox and Smallpox are 97% Identical
The following is Jikkyleaks response to EMRO’s tweet above.
That awkward moment when the WHO accidentally reveals that smallpox was never really eradicated, by declaring a mpox “PHEIC.”
97% identical genome.
That’s why your “mpox” vaccine is a smallpox vaccine.
Changes things a bit doesn’t it?
[Jikkyleaks then linked to two previous Twitter threads posted in 2022, the first time WHO declared monkeypox a public health emergency of international concern (“PHEIC”). You can read these threads HERE and HERE Note: Monkeypox is now referred to as mpox.]
To put this in context, [Herpes simplex virus 1] HSV-1 and HSV-2 are only 80% identical and they often crossover in their clinical symptomatology, i.e. are indistinguishable.
[Varicella-zoster virus] VZV (chickenpox) is totally different – no similarity.
They sold smallpox as an airborne virus. It was a lie.

A United Nations youth climate adviser has come under fire after old posts uncovered on her social media talked about how she wanted the end of capitalism and claimed that “terrorism” is a slur used by the West to justify imperialism. Her posts also called for attacks on White people for supposedly pushing humanity’s destruction through the so-called climate crisis.
Pakistani-American Ayisha Siddiqa was personally appointed by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in 2023 to be one of his advisers and to help “accelerate the implementation of his climate action agenda.”
The Secretary-General’s Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change gives realistic advice and actual recommendations to expedite the implementation of the UN’s climate action agenda. Siddiqa was selected for the two-year assignment based on her “demonstrated commitment to the UN’s values.”
Nevertheless, Siddiqa’s social media posts show radical leftist beliefs beyond environmentalism. Her old activity showed that she endorses the abolition of the police, support for anti-capitalist ideals like Marxism and socialism and repeated racism against White people.
Siddiqa’s climate activism does not come from a desire to protect the environment, but to challenge the West for its wars and Middle Eastern involvement, which she claims is linked to oil, as stated in a May 2020 post on her account on X, formerly Twitter.
“You want to know why I got into climate activism; it wasn’t because I wanted to protect the environment… I became involved [because] the West slaughtered, bombed and starved my people to death in the name of oil. And no one talks about it,” Siddiqa wrote.

Siddiqa also charged the West with “organized terrorism” in connection with the climate crisis and questioned the term “terrorism” when employed by the West to describe actions by Islamist groups.
Siddiqa, in a post about Hamas launching rockets into Israeli civilian areas in May 2021, cited Marxist thinkers Franz Fanon and Angela Davis, who backed violence as a means of liberation.
Siddiqa blames White people for climate change, stating in a March 2021 post, “The white man has brought life as we know it, to the verge of extinction.”
She also believes White people in the climate movement should be stripped of power, saying: “We’re allowing White people to have too much space … White people have absolutely no prerogative or authority to lead the movement.” (Related: WHITE PEOPLE: The only race you can legally discriminate against in the USA.)
Siddiqa denounced the United States and Western foreign policy, calling President Joe Biden a “war criminal” and tagging the British Royal family as “inequality, capitalism & White supremacy personified” in 2020.
Following the George Floyd riots of 2020, Siddiqa said in a post, “America you looted every inch of this planet, raped and [pillaged] its Brown and Black people and now you are angry that your citizens are doing it to you.”
Apart from supporting the abolition of the police, Siddiqa also believes the Black Lives Matter (BLM) demonstrations were ideal for climate activists of what it looks like to be “a credible threat to power.”
“When you are a credible threat to power, you don’t get to… attain permits & permission to take to the streets… When you are really threatening systems of oppression you have to hide your identity, like many BLM protestors & BIPOC climate activists have had to do. Revolutionary fights… are battles born out of sheer necessity,” Siddiqa said.
The UN youth climate adviser also expects the destruction of capitalism for allegedly continuing “evils.” Siddiqa thinks capitalism is “the manifestation of racism” and its abolition is essential to her climate agenda.
“Capitalism and a livable planet are incompatible,” Siddiqa stated, claiming humanity had seven years to turn the tables. “Working within capitalism is what will eventually kill us.” She also added that capitalism “devours everything, from protest to rebellion.”

2168,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-06-07,"Confident Putin warns Europe is ‘defenceless’
Ever since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has been engaged in nuclear sabre-rattling, dropping a series of not-so-subtle hints that trying to defeat a nuclear power like Russia could have disastrous consequences for those who try.
Today President Putin claimed that Russia wouldn’t need to use a nuclear weapon to achieve victory in Ukraine.
He was being interviewed at a panel discussion at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum: the annual event often described as ‘Russia’s Davos’.
There are few occasions when Mr Putin looks dovish compared to the person asking him the questions.
But when the person asking the questions is Sergei Karaganov it would be hard not to. Mr Karaganov is a hawkish Russian foreign policy expert. Last year he called for a pre-emptive nuclear strike. Today he suggested holding a “nuclear pistol” to the temple of the West over Ukraine.
President Putin wasn’t so extreme in his language.
But he is no dove.
The Kremlin leader said he did not rule out changes to Russia’s nuclear doctrine: the document which sets out the conditions under which Russia would use nuclear weapons.
“This doctrine is a living tool and we are carefully watching what is happening in the world around us and do not exclude making changes to this doctrine. This is also related to the testing of nuclear weapons.”
And he delivered a warning to those European countries who’ve been supporting Ukraine: Russia has “many more [tactical nuclear weapons] than there are on the European continent, even if the United States brings theirs over.”
“Europe does not have a developed [early warning system],” he added. “In this sense they are more or less defenceless.”
Tactical nuclear weapons are smaller warheads designed to destroy targets without widespread radioactive fallout.
This has been a surreal week in St Petersburg. On the one hand, a huge international economic forum has been taking place , sending the message that Russia is ready for cooperation and that, despite everything, it’s business as usual.
Clearly, though, it is not business as usual. Russia is waging war in Ukraine, a war which is now in its third year; as a result, Russia is the most heavily sanctioned country in the world.
And, right now, tensions are soaring between Russia and the West.
Earlier this week, at a meeting with international news agency chiefs in St Petersburg, President Putin suggested that Russia might supply advanced conventional long-range weapons to others to strike Western targets.
This was his response to Nato allies allowing Ukraine to strike Russian territory with Western-supplied weapons.
He repeated the idea again today.
“We are not supplying those weapons yet, but we reserve the right to do so to those states or legal entities which are under certain pressure, including military pressure, from the countries that supply weapons to Ukraine and encourage their use on Russian territory.”
There were no details. No names.
So, to which parts of the world might Russia deploy its missiles?
“Wherever we think it is necessary, we’re definitely going to put them. As President Putin made clear, we’ll investigate this question,” Vladimir Solovyov, one of Russian state TV’s most prominent hosts, tells me.
“If you are trying to harm us you have to be pretty sure we have enough opportunities and chances to harm you.”
“In the West some will say we’ve heard this sabre-rattling before,” I respond, “and that it’s a bluff.”
“It’s always a bluff. Until the time when it is not,” Mr Solovyov replies. “You can keep thinking that Russia is bluffing and then, one day, there is no more Great Britain to laugh at. Don’t you ever try to push the Russian bear thinking that ‘Oh, it’s a kitten, we can play with it.”
CEOs from Europe and America used to flock to the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. Not any more. Instead I saw delegations from Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America. Russia has been using this year’s event to try to show that, despite Western sanctions, there are plenty of countries in the world who are ready to do business with Russia.
And what have we learnt in St Petersburg about Vladimir Putin?
That he sounds increasingly confident and determined not to back down. He seems to believe that in the current standoff between Russia and the West, it is the West that will blink first."
3783,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-10-09,"- A study found that vitamin D is linked with better cardiometabolic health.
- People taking it had better blood pressure, total cholesterol, and fasting blood glucose.
- Some groups did even better, such as those with vitamin D deficiency or lower BMI.
- Experts say it’s a good idea to get tested by a doctor before taking larger doses.
- Sunlight and vitamin D-rich foods are the best ways to get this important nutrient.
According to a large meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, taking vitamin D supplements was linked with better cardiometabolic health.
The study, published online on July 26, 2024, in the journal Engineering, found that a daily median dose of 3,320 International Units (IU) was necessary to achieve these benefits.
Study participants consuming vitamin D had better blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic), total cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1C, and fasting blood insulin.
However, the effect was stronger in non-Westerners, older adults, people with lower baseline vitamin D levels, those with lower body mass index (BMI), and those who took the supplement longer. This was especially true regarding glycemic-related measurements.
The study authors additionally highlighted the importance of providing each person with an individualized dose, given these differences in response.
“Our findings suggest that higher vitamin D levels are required to maintain cardiovascular health in non-Westerners, obese, and older populations,” they wrote. “Consequently, consideration should be given to administering higher doses for longer durations when designing personalized intervention strategies aimed at enhancing cardiometabolic health in these populations.”
To conduct their study, the team searched several large databases of medical research to identify all relevant studies.
Altogether, 99 suitable studies were found that included a total of 17,656 participants.
These participants ranged in age from 6 to 75 years, with a median age of 50.35.
Both Western and non-Western countries were included.
The researchers extracted data from the studies in order to learn how effective vitamin D supplementation was in improving cardiometabolic risk factors.
They also looked at how people’s ethnocultural background (Western versus non-Western), baseline vitamin D levels, BMI, vitamin D dosage, age, and length of supplementation influenced the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
Their analysis found that, overall, vitamin D supplementation improved all measures of cardiometabolic health throughout the entire population.
The groups who benefited the most were non-Westerners, those who started with a 25-hydroxy vitamin D level of less than 15.0 ng/mL (below 20 ng/mL is generally deemed to be vitamin D deficiency), those having a BMI less than 30 kg/m2 (non-obese), those 50 years of age or above, and those using vitamin D supplements for longer than three months.
Akanksha Kulkarni, a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist at Prowise Healthcare, who was not involved in the study, advised that it is necessary to get a blood test prior to supplementing to see what your current vitamin D levels are.
“This test is usually performed by your doctor, who will also give you guidance on how to administer the dose if necessary,” she said.
She urges caution because vitamin D can build up to toxic levels if taken in excess for too long.
It can cause calcium to build up too high, contributing to kidney stones and even bone damage, according to Kulkarni.
Excess calcium buildup can also cause symptoms such as:
- nausea
- vomiting
- weakness
- frequent urination
People should avoid taking large amounts of vitamin D without visiting a doctor, she stressed.
However, if you do opt to take a supplement, the National Institute of Health’s Office of Dietary Supplements says the
Up to 4,000 IU daily is considered to be safe. Anything above this should only be taken under a doctor’s supervision.
Michael Lahey, MD, a physician and preventive healthcare specialist with My Weight Loss Partner, who was also not a part of the study, said that one of the best ways to get adequate vitamin D is through sun exposure.
“Natural production of vitamin D requires only moderate amounts of sunlight, 10-30 minutes, 2-3 times a week,” he said.
“But one should not expose their skin to the sun without protection to prevent skin harm,” added Lahey, noting that too much unprotected sun exposure can raise your risk for skin cancer.
“Tanning beds are the worst and should be strongly discouraged,” he added.
You can also get plenty of vitamin D from foods like fatty fish, fortified dairy products, and egg yolks, said Lahey. There are times, however, when supplementation could be advisable.
“This is especially important during winter or in such regions where the sun does not shine through most of the year,” he said. “Lack of sun and proper diet can be met with supplements to ensure that your body has the right vitamin D it requires.”
A new study has found that vitamin D supplementation was associated with improved cardiometabolic health.
People who took vitamin D supplements had better blood pressure, total cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1C, and fasting blood insulin.
However, some people — such as non-Westerners, older adults, people with lower baseline vitamin D, those with lower BMI, and those who took the supplement longer — responded even better.
Experts say most adults should stick with the recommended amount of vitamin D — 600 IU — unless they have been tested and advised by a doctor to take more.
Exposure to sunlight (within limits) and eating foods rich in vitamin D are the best ways to maintain vitamin D levels."

Equality PAC raises millions to boost LGBTQ representation in Congress
On a recent night in Washington D.C., the historic hall at Union Station was decked out for a glittering gala. A drag queen, political heavyweights, and Hollywood stars were all gathered to celebrate the tenth anniversary of Equality PAC.
“Welcome to our annual convening of the gay mafia,” quipped Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., to the crowd.
Torres is the co-chair of the Equality PAC, the political arm of the Congressional Equality Caucus which was created to advocate for “equality for all people regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or sex characteristics.”
The celebration was more than just an anniversary, it was an opportunity to raise money to add to the $12 million the group has already raised this cycle to help elect more openly LGBTQ members and allies to Congress and advance the Equality Act – a bill that would enshrine protections for the LGBTQ community.
The PAC’s success over the years has allowed the group to expand beyond just electing LGBTQ candidates. It's now raising funds to support other major battlegrounds for the Democratic party, including so-called frontline members fighting to keep their seats in challenging districts and “red to blue” candidates who are running to unseat Republicans.
“[Co-chair Rep. Mark Takano] and I are very proud of that,” Torres said. “Because we recognize that without a pro-equality Congress, without a Speaker Hakeem Jeffries, a Democratic Senate and a Democratic president, we will never be able to make the Equality Act the law of the land.”
Passing the legislation is a tall order. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi made that much clear, laying out the steps for the crowd: if Democrats get a majority in the Senate, they could vote to “pull back” the filibuster in order to pass the Equality Act with 51 votes, rather than the standard 60 required.
Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif, used his remarks to remind supporters their success depends on electing allies at all levels, including President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. He told attendees it is “our job to remember” the support of the Biden administration.
“It was Joe Biden that as vice president came out in favor of same sex marriage that then nudged President Obama to coming out and being the first administration to support gay marriage,” he said. “And Vice President Harris, some of you from California may remember that she began marrying gay couples when she was the D.A. in San Francisco — before gay marriage was even legal across the country.”
Expanding LGBTQ representation in Congress
There are currently nine openly LGBTQ House members and three senators in Congress. Equality PAC, one of various identity-based political action committees that fund Congressional races, is backing six House candidates to increase their ranks – all Democrats.
“If you were a Republican who sponsored the Equality Act and sponsored every legislative priority for the LGBTQ community, then in theory you're eligible [for PAC support],” Torres told NPR ahead of the gala. “But in practice, no such Republican exists. And even if you had a Republican who was pro-LGBTQ, if you're voting for a speaker who's anti-LGBTQ, then that is a factor against you.”
He said many in the LGBTQ community fear established rights could be on the chopping block following the 2022 Supreme Court decision that overturned the constitutional right to abortion.
“Despite the success of marriage equality in 2015, I think we have to be careful not to prematurely declare mission accomplished, not to lull ourselves into a false sense of security,” Torres said. “A woman born in 2024 has fewer rights than she did in 1973, which is a tragic reminder that progress cannot be taken for granted, that LGBTQ rights can be every bit as fragile as reproductive rights.”
Torres said he views an “emergence of a new culture war, and the prime target is the trans community.”
“We are witnessing unprecedented fear mongering and scapegoating against LGBTQ people, against members of the trans community in particular,” Torres said.
Torres — who became the first openly LGBTQ Black-Latino member of Congress in 2021 — said his own political journey is a success of the PAC, and he’s now paying it forward to help a new slate of candidates win decisively.
“I think campaigning is part problem solving and part psychotherapy,” said Torres, who joined last year as the PAC's co-chair, serving alongside co-founder Takano.
“We will host fundraisers, but also we provide technical assistance on how to run a campaign. We provide emotional support to the candidates. We give our cell phone numbers to every candidate we endorse. So if there's anything we can do to be helpful, we're on speed dial.”
‘PACS are not the enemy of politics’
Texas State Rep. Julie Johnson said that kind of support from Equality PAC helped her fend off a runoff election in the March primary, where the second-place candidate was thirty-one points behind her.
“PACs are not the enemy of politics. PACs create a vehicle for donors to unite around a common cause. I think that we need to really get out of this misnomer,” Johnson told NPR. “[Equality PAC has] been the single greatest partner I've had on the road. They have introduced me to donors, they've helped me secure good consultants, they've helped me navigate some of the media issues, the policy issues.”
Her district is considered a safe bet for Democrats. If elected in November, Johnson will be the first lesbian representing Texas at the federal level and the first openly LGBTQ person to serve Congress from the South.
“It's not lost on me the significance of what my election represents to a large number of people in Texas and across the country,” Johnson said. “For us to be able to have victory is very important and also to be out and proud. I think it's a message that I am more than a gay person. It's certainly a significant part of me but it’s not all of me. I'm a mother. I'm a lawyer. And the whole of me comes to the process. And it makes it to where I can resonate with voters and they see themselves in me, whether they're straight or gay or not or whatever, because we have so many other things [in common] too.”
She said outside of her history-making bid, there’s power in the representation of the campaign itself.
“The visibility of it at home is a big deal,” she said. “I come from a very large media market in Dallas-Fort Worth. And to be able to see political ads on TV that are positive, that engage the LGBT community and reflect LGBT people in such a positive way, is really key when they get a lot of messages to the contrary on the Republican side. It really makes a difference for people to be able to see themselves — 'oh, my goodness, there's somebody – they see me. They are me.' And that makes a huge impact.”
‘It’s much harder to hate up close’
Delaware State Sen. Sarah McBride is familiar with the feelings that come with being “a first.” She was the first openly transgender person elected to a state senate and is poised to win the sole Delaware House seat in November, which would make her the first trans member in Congress.
“When people like me are facing a cruel and concerted attack, it's critical to have full and effective legislators at all levels of government who happen to be trans, proving that trans people are part of the rich diversity of this nation and reinforcing that trans people are people,” she told NPR.
She said she’s part of a text group of Equality PAC-endorsed candidates.
“It’s a small cohort of people who know what it’s like to do what we’re doing day in and day out, and that’s incredibly comforting and helpful as a candidate,"" she said.
McBride said she's witnessed the impact of representation in her time in state politics.
“It's much harder to hate up close,” she said. “I've seen the power of those interpersonal relationships that you have when you are present as a peer and as a colleague – I've seen them transform people's approach, people's minds, people's hearts in Delaware. I know it might be a taller order in Washington, but I know it's possible.”
She said ultimately, if elected to the U.S. Congress, she hopes people won’t think of her identity first when they think about her tenure.
“They'll think about the policies I've helped advance – I think that is the best way to guarantee that while I may be a first, that I'm not the last, and that we build a world where it's no longer noteworthy when a trans candidate runs and wins,” she said."
2502,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-02-15,"Climate scientist Michael Mann recently won his $1 million defamation lawsuit against Rand Simberg and Mark Steyn where the two men fiercely criticized his work. On Wednesday, he joined PBS’s Christiane Amanpour to take a victory lap for his efforts to squash free speech.
Amanpour began by noting, “A new report shows a sharp rise in personal attacks on climate scientists. Well, one widely respected scientist is fighting back. He is Michael Mann, distinguished professor of Environmental Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania. After a pair of conservative climate deniers accused him of faking his data back in 2012. Mann sued for defamation and he won. Last week, a jury awarded him a million dollars in compensatory damages. And Dr. Mann calls the decision a victory for science. And he's joining me now from Philadelphia.”
Writing in National Review in 2012, Steyn opined, “Michael Mann was the man behind the fraudulent climate-change “hockey-stick” graph, the very ringmaster of the tree-ring circus. And, when the East Anglia emails came out, Penn State felt obliged to ‘investigate’ Professor Mann.”
Defending Steyn, National Review top man Rich Lowry wrote, also in 2012, about the problem with Mann’s argument, “In common polemical usage, ‘fraudulent’ doesn’t mean honest-to-goodness criminal fraud. It means intellectually bogus and wrong. I consider Mann’s prospective lawsuit fraudulent. Uh-oh. I guess he now has another reason to sue us.”
Mann originally sued National Review as well, but they were later dropped from the case, but now that Mann was won, he may very well re-sue them. “They’re next,” his lawyer declared.
Back in 2024, Amanpour welcomed Mann with none of this information, “So, firstly, you know, congratulations, especially as you, you know, frame it as a victory for science. What was it that -- you know, that caused you to take on this case and it took you 12 years?”
Patting himself on the back, Mann claimed, “Well, you know, we sort of drew a line in the sand. It's one thing to criticize scientists. That's all, you know, appropriate in science. In fact, good faith criticism, skepticism plays an important role in moving science forward, but making false and defamatory accusations, accusations of fraud and comparing a scientist to a convicted child molester, which is what the plaintiffs did -- what the defendants did in this case, clearly goes beyond the line.”
Back in 2012, Simberg wrote:
But now that we know how bad it was, perhaps it’s time that we revisit the Michael Mann affair, particularly given how much we’ve also learned about his and others’ hockey-stick deceptions since. Mann could be said to be the Jerry Sandusky of climate science, except that instead of molesting children, he has molested and tortured data in the service of politicized science that could have dire economic consequences for the nation and planet.
Politics is full of nasty comparisons. It is not a glorious part of our political discourse that public figures are routinely compared to Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Benito Mussolini, and others, but such comparisons should be protected by the First Amendment. If they aren't, the rest of the media is in big trouble.
Mann continued, “it did take 12 years to play out, but we're very pleased that the jury saw, you know, through the smoke and mirrors that they tried to put up during the trial, saw to the heart of the matter, that they had engaged in false and defamatory allegations. They had done so with malice, hence the award of a million dollars in punitive damages.”
Amanpour then quoted Mann for what she hopes the case means, “So, to be clear again, you have, you know, fought this because of the science and you said, ‘I hope this verdict sends a message that falsely attacking climate scientists is not protected speech.’”
PBS and CNN—Amanpour and Company originally airs on CNN International— do not appear to value free speech. What about the rest of the media?

CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: A new report shows a sharp rise in personal attacks on climate scientists. Well, one widely respected scientist is fighting back. He is Michael Mann, distinguished professor of Environmental Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania. After a pair of conservative climate deniers accused him of faking his data back in 2012. Mann sued for defamation. And he won. Last week, a jury awarded him a million dollars in compensatory damages. And Dr. Mann calls the decision a victory for science. And he's joining me now from Philadelphia.
So, firstly, you know, congratulations, especially as you, you know, frame it as a victory for science. What was it that -- you know, that caused you to take on this case and it took you 12 years?
MICHAEL MANN: Thanks, Christiane. Well, you know, we sort of drew a line in the sand. It's one thing to criticize scientists. That's all, you know, appropriate in science. In fact, good faith criticism, skepticism plays an important role in moving science forward, but making false and defamatory accusations, accusations of fraud and comparing a scientist to a convicted child molester, which is what the plaintiffs did -- what the defendants did in this case, clearly goes beyond the line.
And we sort of -- you know, we had no choice. We asked them to take down those defamatory posts and to apologize. They refused to do that. And so, we moved forward with the litigation. And it did take 12 years to play out, but we're very pleased that the jury saw, you know, through the smoke and mirrors that they tried to put up during the trial, saw to the heart of the matter, that they had engaged in false and defamatory allegations. They had done so with malice, hence the award of a million dollars in punitive damages.

6169,fake,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-03-20,"PBS again went to bat for the “LGBTQ-Plus” warriors on the PBS News Weekend Sunday, lamenting a slight dip in America’s gushing over the alphabet folks in “U.S. support for LGBTQ+ rights is declining after decades of support. Here’s why.”
In the show introduction, anchor John Yang fretted over “declining support for LGBTQ-plus rights, reversing years of increasing support,” then cut to pollster Melissa Deckmant to blame (who else?) Republicans: ""And I think what`s happening is that you see many Republican leaders and red states really trying to amp up the volume, so to speak, on LGBTQ rights, and really trying to claw back some of those rights across the country.""
Already the scene had been set -- you know which side to take and who to boo and hiss at, courtesy of your tax dollars.
Yang had the new alphabet down pat in this story, which overhyped a downward wiggle in polling data (based on new research from a left-wing polling firm, the Public Religion Research Institute, or PRRI, of which Deckman was the CEO).
Reporter William Brangham boasted about the question they used to measure “gender identity”: “What sex were you assigned at birth on your original birth certificate?”
Adding: ""The survey showed for the first time support fell for key policies regarding LGBTQ rights, backing for same sex marriage dropped two percentage points, support for non-discrimination protections dropped four points and opposition to people refusing services based on religious grounds dropped five points.""
Brangham talked to Deckman about the results, “the first time you`ve seen it a downward tick in those numbers. What how do you explain that?”
Acceptance of LGBTQ was not enough -- unanimous approval was required by the gender-obsessed left and Republicans were the problem:
DECKMAN: We saw much deeper declines, for example, among Republicans in terms of their support for these issues, whereas Democrats tended to stay relatively stable. And I think what’s happening is that you see many Republican leaders in red states, really trying to amp up the volume, so to speak, on LGBTQ rights, and really trying to claw back some of those rights across the country. And I think that`s had a spillover effect nationally in terms of the attitudes of Republicans, especially on issues with respect to LGBTQ rights.
Brangham’s suggested explanation for the decline – of persecuted LGBTQ people merely beginning to “assert their rights” -- was a pretty benign description of the media-supported revolution that’s taken place the last several years, including “Bake the cake, bigot!” extremists on the gay-marriage front, and successfully pressuring social media outlets and real-life institutions to deplatform users and fire employees for the crime of “misgendering” biological men. (And threatening Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling with arrest under new “hate crimes” law in Scotland.)
""I mean, is it perhaps also possible that as people start to identify more publicly and assert their rights and take a more prominent place in society, that we could be seeing the traces of a backlash here?,"" Branham wondered.
Deckman blamed Christians: ""As you might imagine, Americans who have a tendency to support Christian nationalism are far less likely to support the rights of LGBTQ Americans, in part because of the theological opposition to the idea of really homosexuality and being queer to begin with…""
And since it was a presidential election year, a call to activism was proclaimed:
BRANHAM: For people who are LGBTQ or work to help solidify their rights, what does this survey data tell you about what work lies ahead for them?
DECKMAN: ….There's now a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. And there's indication that the rights of same-sex marriage are going to be on the line you're going to have legal challenges from conservative groups are going to be fighting to rollback those rights. And I think that this is just a good reminder that those rights shouldn't be taken for granted that it's going to take political organizing, and that elections have consequences.
And so the word went out over the tax-funded airwaves: Vote Biden!

JOHN YANG: For the last few decades, the story of LGBTQ plus rights in America has been one of increasing public support. But now a new survey finds that for the first time in years, there`s a slight decline in that support. William Brangham takes a closer look.
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Throughout 2023, the Public Religion Research Institute, or PRRI, interviewed over 22,000 adults for what it calls its American Values Atlas. Last week, the Organization released its findings on views about LGBTQ rights in the US. The survey showed for the first time support fell for key policies regarding LGBTQ rights, backing for same sex marriage dropped two percentage points, support for non-discrimination protections dropped four points and opposition to people refusing services based on religious grounds dropped five points.
To help us understand this data, we are joined by CEO of PRRI Melissa Deckman. You`ve been doing this survey for years. And this being the first time you`ve seen it a downward tick in those numbers. What how do you explain that?
MELISSA DECKMAN, CEO, Public Religion Research Institute: Yeah, we were somewhat surprised to see after several years of increasing support among Americans for LGBTQ rights, that we saw a decline. But I think if you look under the hood, so to speak, and look at the data more closely, it`s really largely driven by party polarization.
And so we saw much deeper declines, for example, among Republicans in terms of their support for these issues, whereas Democrats tended to stay relatively stable. And I think what`s happening is that you see many Republican leaders in red states, really trying to amp up the volume, so to speak on LGBTQ rights, and really trying to claw back some of those rights across the country.
And I think that`s had a spillover effect nationally in terms of the attitudes of Republicans, especially on issues with respect to LGBT rights.
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In your survey, you`re talking to people who both affiliate with a particular religion and also non-religious people as well, correct?
MELISSA DECKMAN: That`s right. So our surveys are done among Americans nationally. One great thing about the ABA is we also have enough data to look at opinions in all 50 states. But essentially, we get a snapshot of all Americans, including people of faith and people who are unaffiliated.
I think it`s also important to bear in mind that despite these declines that we`ve seen, the vast majority of people of faith continue to support the rights of LGBTQ Americans, especially with respect to same sex marriage and non-discrimination laws.
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So for someone who might look at this and think, Oh, what a 2 percent decline or a 5 percent decline is not that substantial. What Why does this really stand out to you?
MELISSA DECKMAN: I think it stands out. Because with respect to LGBT rights, we`re generally there has been a growing increase in support among Americans. And part of that is a reflection of the fact that more Americans, especially younger Americans, are identifying as LGBTQ.
So younger Americans, more Americans have friends who are LGBTQ, they themselves are LGBTQ, they have colleagues. So there has been this assumption that as we become more, I think, accepting of LGBT Americans in our daily lives, that it would just naturally lend itself to people being more supportive of protecting the rights of LGBTQ Americans.
But I think this data shows you that that`s not necessarily an assumption that is true. And so it`s something important to monitor and keep aware of.
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I mean, is it perhaps also possible that as people start to identify more publicly and assert their rights and take a more prominent place in society, that we could be seeing the traces of a backlash year?
MELISSA DECKMAN: I think that`s exactly what you`re seeing. One of the things that we analyze in the report is we look at the relationship between Christian nationalist views and support for LGBTQ rights. As you might imagine, Americans who have a tendency to support Christian nationalism are far less likely to support the rights of LGBTQ Americans, in part because of the theological opposition to the idea of really homosexuality and being queer to begin with.
And so I think that there`s that important relationship there that we have to really keep in mind.
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You`re talking about are there other below the top lines here other data points that really that were of interest to you?
MELISSA DECKMAN: We were really surprised in our findings that younger Americans have trended downward with respect to support for LGBTQ rights. If you look at our data, we find that roughly one in five Americans aged 18 to 29 identify as LGBTQ. But yet what`s happened over the past couple of years is that there`s been a slight decline among younger Americans.
I think the assumption was that because younger Americans are more likely to identify as queer that we`d always have younger Americans being more supportive. Again, though, you have to look under the hood. It`s really party polarization that is driving down support among younger Americans for same sex marriage, for example.
So one number really stands out to us. If you look at young Americans attitudes about same sex marriage, and 2020 among Republicans, two thirds supported same sex marriage rights. But in last year`s data among young Republicans aged 18 to 29, it`s less than half, that`s a really big cratering of support.
I think there was often an assumption among many political analysts that younger Republicans would moderate the party with respect to things like LGBTQ rights, or even abortion rights or climate change, et cetera. But what we`re finding in this data is that younger Republicans are very conservative socially.
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So interesting. For people who are LGBTQ or work to help solidify their rights, what does this survey data tell you about what work lies ahead for them?
MELISSA DECKMAN: Well, I think there`s the survey data, it really points, as we like to say, the canary in the coal mine idea that you can assume that such rights are going to be held in perpetuity or will increase. And you can also assume just because the vast majority of Americans support these rights, that those rights are going to be legally protected, especially in wake of the Dobbs decision."
5680,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-09-05,"KYIV -- With Russia’s full-scale invasion at 30 months and counting, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is trying to shake things up – on the battlefield and in the halls of power in Kyiv.
In early August, Ukraine launched a surprise incursion into Russian territory, sending troops across the border and opening a new front in the Kursk region.
This week, Zelenskiy launched the biggest government shake-up since the all-out war began, replacing Kyiv's foreign minister -- a prominent face of Ukraine abroad since 2020 -- and engineering several other changes in the cabinet of ministers and his influential administration, widely known as the presidential office.
Here’s a look at the motives, the timing, and the potential effects of a move that the wartime leader says will give Ukraine “new energy” at a crucial juncture but that critics say will actually change little.
Why Now?
Zelenskiy replaced his defense minister a year ago and the commander in chief of the armed forces in February, and there had long been rumblings of a more sweeping change in government.
Ruslan Stefanchuk, speaker of Ukraine’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, announced in June that there would be changes in the cabinet, noting that several ministries, including those in charge of culture, agricultural policy, and infrastructure, had been without confirmed ministers for some time.
Nothing happened at that time, though, and subsequent rumors that Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal might be on the way out proved inaccurate. He is still in place.
Prominent political scientist Volodymyr Fesenko told RFE/RL that he believes Zelenskiy and his chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, had long wanted to make changes but only recently “had time” to get to the nitty-gritty and make decisions about who should go where.
“As soon as they took the corresponding political decisions…that’s when it happened,” Fesenko said.
In any case, the shake-up comes at an intense time in the war, with Ukraine holding territory in Russia’s Kursk region and Moscow’s forces pressing forward in the Donbas -- the eastern provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk, which Russian President Vladimir Putin appears determined to seize in their entirety.
It also comes ahead of a tough winter, as Ukraine struggles to keep the power on while Russian forces pummel the country’s energy infrastructure in addition to the homes of civilians. Furthermore, it comes as Zelenskiy, who is beseeching the West to let Ukraine strike military targets deeper in Russia with long-range weapons -- prepares to potentially hand U.S. President Joe Biden a “victory plan” later this month.
What's The Goal?
On September 4, Zelenskiy said that Ukraine needs “new energy” and described the government shake-up that was unfolding as aimed at “strengthening our state in various areas."" The president, who was elected in April 2019, said that some officials have been in their posts for 4 1/2 to five years.
He called for quick results in an address the following evening, urging his new team to work ""more actively than before"" and achieve advancements in arms industry investments, financial stability, ""support for the front line,"" and Ukraine's EU membership bid.
Some opponents suspect the reshuffle is aimed at further consolidating power in the hands of Zelenskiy and his administration, pointing to the fact that several of the moves involve cabinet members shifting to the presidential office or vice-versa.
Andriy Sybiha, the former first deputy foreign minister who is replacing Dmytro Kuleba as the top Ukrainian diplomat, earlier worked in the presidential office. The new minister of development of communities, territories, and infrastructure, Oleksiy Kuleba, is a former deputy of Yermak. And Iryna Vereshchuk, the former minister for reintegration of temporarily occupied territories, is moving to the presidential office to work on social policy.
Oleh Rybachuk, a deputy prime minister under former President Viktor Yushchenko and now head of the Kyiv-based NGO Center UA, said that “it’s impossible to talk about new faces [in the cabinet] because they are chosen based on many criteria and by various influence groups. They have to go through this ‘casting’ process by influential figures in [Zelenskiy’s] office -- mainly Yermak.”
Yermak has not commented on his role in the shake-up. Earlier, in an interview with a Ukrainian media outlet, he responded to claims that he interferes in the work of the Foreign Ministry by saying, ""My authority ends where the mandate of the president ends,"" adding that he sees himself as a national-security adviser.
Fesenko had a different take than Rybachuk on the back-and-forth movement between the cabinet and the presidential office. The “personnel reserve…is limited,” he said, so the new appointments were made by “choosing from among those who have proven themselves on Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s team.”
“They want to keep people on the president’s team so that they don’t just go nowhere, so Vereshchuk will work for a while in the presidential office, and then maybe some other positions will emerge,” Fesenko said.
Will The Shake-Up Succeed?
Opposition figures voiced doubt that the government shake-up will bring positive change.
“No fresh blood will emerge, let’s put it bluntly,” Yulia Klymenko, a lawmaker from the opposition party Holos, said on an RFE/RL Ukrainian Service program on September 5. “It’s the same people. They are just changing places, moving from one ministry to another. We don’t see or hear any new ideas or fresh or new people.”
Laying out what he suggested was a barrier to effective change, Rybachuk asserted that ministers have little power, while “the real decisions” are made by people close to Zelenskiy in his office, who he said “do not bear the necessary level of responsibility for their decisions.”
“The president says he wants to see people with new energy, active professionals, but at the same time his entourage says that he is setting the condition that these new people must understand faster…and immediately fulfill all the whims, essentially, of the president and his office,” Rybachuk said on the same program. “That is certainly not a model that will bring us significant results.”
Supporters of Zelenskiy argue that he is open to bringing new people into government, pointing among other things to his appointment of Rustam Umerov, of the Holos party, as defense minister last year.
Fesenko said he believes that by “new energy” Zelenskiy meant changes within existing teams and not exclusively “new faces.”
""At one time, the president ‘fell ill’ with this ‘disease of the new face’ when he thought that if he appointed enough new, young people, there would be an update” or change, he said. “And it turned out that, unfortunately, it does not work.”
Ukrainians are likely to judge the shake-up by how things go in the coming weeks and months.
A woman in Sumy, a northeastern border region that comes under frequent attack from Russia, suggested that she welcomed a shake-up “because there is no satisfaction…with the people who have been sitting in posts for too long.”
“There are no changes,” she told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service.
A man in the northern city of Chernihiv, which avoided Russian capture early in the full-scale invasion and also comes under attack as the war drags on, said he believes the shake-up “is about all those ministers who have compiled certain negative [images]. As a response, the government is trying to get rid of those negatives along with the people.""
But he suggested he would not hold his breath, saying that what’s important is “not the people but the system we have.”
A woman in the same city said her biggest hope is “for the war to end soon.”
“My two sons are fighting, and my grandson is in the military,” she said, repeating that she hopes “the war will end as soon as possible.”"
5238,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-09-17,"Lawmakers in Georgia have approved in a third and final reading restrictive new laws curbing LGBT rights and allowing for bans on cultural events such as Pride marches in a vote boycotted by the opposition, underscoring a dramatically polarized political landscape ahead of national elections in October.
A group of protesters outside the parliament building in downtown Tbilisi on September 17 held signs decrying the draft legislation as ignoring the real problems of Georgian families.
The package of legal changes, which came under the title On Family Values And Protection Of Minors, amends 18 current laws, including on free speech and expression, as well as broadcasting.
It allows for bans on gatherings that promote the notion of a person identifying as a gender other than ""his or her biological sex"" or same-sex orientation or relationships.
The initiative was brought forward by the ruling Georgian Dream party and passed by a vote of 84-0 in a chamber that most of the opposition has boycotted since May.
That's when Georgian Dream lawmakers approved a ""foreign influence"" bill that Georgians and Western governments liken to the decade-old ""foreign agent"" law used by Russian authorities to clamp down on dissent with broad discretion.
They ended up overriding a presidential veto of the legislation to enact it.
The United States and other Western states expressed concern about the law, which requires organizations that receive more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad to register as ""agents of foreign influence.""
On September 16, the United States slapped sanctions on more than 60 Georgians, including two members of the government, who it said had ""undermined"" democracy and human rights in the country.
Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze met on September 17 with U.S. Ambassador Robin Dunnigan and warned that Georgia might revise ties with the United States in response to the new sanctions.
""If one more such step is taken, this might lead to a revision of Georgia's stance on U.S.-Georgian relations,"" Kobakhidze said in the meeting with Dunnigan, according to a statement by the prime minister's office.
Tens of thousands of Georgians demonstrated against the bill despite a brutal crackdown and violent retaliation. Most protesters referred to the bill as ""the Russian law"" because of its similarity to decade-old legislation in Russia that has contributed to a fierce clampdown on independent media and public dissent there.
The European Union reacted to the enactment of the bill by pausing EU accession negotiations, while the United States opted to launch a ""comprehensive review"" of relations with Georgia.
In setting election day for October 26, Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili called the vote a choice between ""being Russia's slave or cooperation with Europe.""
Opinion polls show that Georgian Dream remains the country's single most popular party ahead of the election."
3720,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-09-17,"- New research suggests consuming three cups of coffee or 200–300 mg of caffeine daily may reduce the risk of developing cardiometabolic diseases compared to consuming little to none.
- Caffeine may improve cardiometabolic health by lowering inflammation, but excess caffeine is associated with negative side effects.
- There are other ways to support cardiometabolic health, such as focusing on exercise and improving sleep quality.
Cardiometabolic multimorbidity occurs when there are two or more diseases related to cardiovascular or metabolic health, including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and stroke.
As the global population ages, the
While prior research has highlighted the protective effects of coffee, tea, and caffeine against these diseases individually, their impact on the development of cardiometabolic multimorbidity has remained largely unknown.
Now, a large new study suggests that regular moderate coffee and caffeine consumption may decrease the risk of developing multiple cardiometabolic diseases in healthy adults, compared to consuming little to none.
The findings were published online ahead of print in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.
The observational study explored how coffee, tea, and caffeine consumption might affect cardiometabolic health.
Researchers used data from the UK Biobank, which includes diet and health information from over 500,000 United Kingdom residents ages 40 to 69.
They focused on participants who had completed at least one dietary questionnaire, excluding those with pre-existing cardiometabolic conditions or incomplete data on coffee or tea consumption.
The final analysis examined the caffeine consumption of 172,315 participants and coffee and tea intake of 188,091 participants. Researchers differentiated between regular and decaf options and estimated participants’ usual intake by averaging their responses from multiple dietary questionnaires.
Participants were categorized based on the estimated average coffee and tea intake (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more drinks per day) and estimated total caffeine intake per day in milligrams (mg) from regular coffee and tea, ranging from 0 to 100 mg daily to over 400 mg daily.
The study also analyzed 168 metabolites — substances produced during metabolism — to identify those associated with coffee, tea, and caffeine consumption and new cases of cardiometabolic multimorbidity among large subsets of participants.
New cardiometabolic multimorbidity was defined as having developed at least two of the following conditions:
Over a median follow-up period of 11.7 years, less than 1% of participants developed cardiometabolic multimorbidity.
Based on their initial caffeine intake, 135,844 participants (78.83%) consumed over 100 mg daily, with most (96.10%) consuming less than 400 mg daily.
The researchers observed that consuming coffee and caffeine at moderate estimated levels was linked to a lower risk of developing multiple cardiometabolic diseases.
Specifically, consuming three 8-ounce cups of coffee or 200–300 mg of caffeine daily was associated with a 48.1% or 40.7% lower risk of cardiometabolic multimorbidity, respectively, compared to nonconsumers or those with less than 100 mg of daily caffeine intake.
Researchers also identified 81 to 97 metabolites related to coffee, tea, and caffeine intake that may be associated with these health issues, which could help inform future research.
Based on their findings, the researchers concluded that regularly consuming moderate amounts of coffee and caffeine might help protect healthy adults from developing cardiometabolic multimorbidity.
Although the study’s results are promising, they should be interpreted cautiously.
As observational research, it cannot establish causality. The results also may not fully represent the general population, as the study only included UK residents and dietary data from less than half of the UK Biobank participants, who generally had healthier diets and slightly better health.
Additionally, the study did not account for dietary changes over time and only considered caffeine intake from coffee and tea, excluding other dietary sources.
If you need more reasons to enjoy your daily coffee or tea, Alyssa Simpson, a registered dietitian in Phoenix, AZ, highlighted a few benefits.
“Moderate caffeine intake has several benefits beyond cardiometabolic health, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that may protect against liver disease, certain cancers, and
The
Simpson advised staying within this recommended limit. “Excessive caffeine can lead to issues like sleep problems, migraine headaches, and increased eye pressure, and may be problematic for sensitive groups such as pregnant people, children, and adolescents,” she cautioned.
Anyone considering upping their caffeine intake, even to moderate daily levels, should be cautious about caffeine’s other potential side effects, such as:
- jitters
- rapid heartbeat
- temporarily increased blood pressure
To maintain a healthy caffeine habit, Simpson suggested opting for black coffee or green tea, avoiding excess added sugar or high-fat creamers, and choosing organic options when possible to reduce pesticide exposure.
It’s also advisable to enjoy caffeine earlier in the day to prevent sleep disturbances, she said.
For those who prefer sweeter beverages, consider using natural sweeteners, like 100% stevia or monk fruit extract, or minimally refined natural sugars, such as pure grade A honey or coconut sugar, in small amounts.
While caffeine has many benefits, Seema Shah, MPH, an integrative and functional registered dietitian in Long Beach, CA, told Healthline you don’t need to rely on caffeine alone to reduce your cardiometabolic disease risk. Shah wasn’t involved in the new study.
Instead, you could focus on the many other “powerful foods and behaviors” that can promote cardiometabolic health without the potential downsides of caffeine consumption, Shah said, such as:
- getting regular physical exercise and movement
- eating an anti-inflammatory diet filled with lots of colorful fruits and veggies
- getting good quality sleep
- managing stress
- having meaningful relationships to reduce loneliness
A new observational study suggests that moderate coffee or caffeine consumption might be linked to a reduced risk of developing multiple cardiometabolic diseases, including stroke, coronary heart disease, and diabetes.
The beneficial effects of caffeine could be due to its ability to reduce inflammation.
However, consuming too much caffeine can have negative effects. Caffeine consumption isn’t the only option to lower your cardiometabolic disease risk.
If you choose to enjoy caffeine, do so in moderation. Consider consulting your physician or a registered dietitian, especially if you have heart issues or other health conditions that may be impacted by caffeine intake."

OTTAWA, Ontario (LifeSiteNews) — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberals are once again blaming Canadian wildfires on “climate change” despite most being man-made.
In a May 10 press release, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland lectured Canadians on the so-called dangers of “climate change” amid Canada’s wildfire season, apparently ignoring that data has revealed that most wildfires are man-made.
“Climate change is here, and we’re making sure our communities are ready,” Trudeau stated.
“Last year was the worst wildfire season in Canadian history, and climate change is only causing more frequent and more extreme wildfires,” Freeland claimed.
In addition to the Liberal government, mainstream media outlets have also started publishing articles attributing Canada’s wildfires to “climate change.”
“The seeds of fire activity were sown over the winter and in past years as the world continues to warm because of human-driven climate change,” CNN claimed in a May 15 article.
Despite the claims of the Trudeau government, the Alberta Wildfire Status Dashboard, which tracks wildfires in the province, found that 232 (72.96 percent) of the wildfires started this year have been linked to human activity. On the other hand, only 1 (0.31 percent) was caused by lightning, while 85 (26.73 percent) remain under investigation.
Last month, Alberta Minister of Forestry and Parks Todd Loewen revealed that his department estimates that most of the province’s wildfires this year are man-made.
Additionally, an April study revealed that while global temperatures have “moderately” increased since 1950, the claim that extreme weather events are significantly increasing is unsupported by scientific evidence.
Telling Canadians the same lies as in 2023
Indeed, Trudeau and the media his government funds appear intent on blaming Canada’s wildfires on “climate change” regardless of the facts, similar to their tactics in spring 2023 when Canada faced one of its worst fire seasons.
“Rise in extreme wildfires linked directly to emissions from oil companies in new study,” Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), which gets 70 percent of its operating budget via tax dollars from the federal government, claimed at the time.
However, similar to now, Trudeau’s claims were unfounded and contradicted both research and wildfire data.
Indeed, despite claims that wildfires have drastically increased due to “climate change,” 2023 research revealed that wildfires have decreased globally while media coverage has spiked 400 percent.
Furthermore, many of the fires last spring and summer were discovered to be caused by arsonists and not “climate change.”
Last year, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) arrested and charged suspected arsonists for allegedly lighting fires across the country, including in the Yukon, British Columbia, and Alberta.
In Quebec, satellite footage also showed the mysterious simultaneous eruption of several blazes across the province, sparking concerns that the fires were a coordinated effort by arsonists.
Why push the ‘climate change’ narrative?
Trudeau’s determination to push the claim that the fires are unprecedentedly dangerous and caused by “climate change” appears by critics to be nothing but an attempt to pass further regulations on natural resources.
The Trudeau government has continued to insist on so-called net zero carbon policies, seeking a complete elimination of the fossil fuel industry in the future.
The reduction and eventual elimination of the use of so-called “fossil fuels” and a transition to unreliable “green” energy has also been pushed by the World Economic Forum (WEF) – the globalist group behind the socialist “Great Reset” agenda – an organization with which Trudeau and some in his cabinet are involved.
While Trudeau’s plan has been pushed under the guise of “sustainability,” his intention to decrease nitrous oxide emissions by limiting the use of fertilizer has been criticized by farmers. They say this will reduce profits and could even lead to food shortages.

3690,fake,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-09-08,"An unearthed FBI report from 2023 contains screenshots from Gray's banned Discord account showing that he was extremely frustrated about so-called ""trans issues"" before eventually deciding that the only course of action was to go on a shooting rampage at his school.
Not only that, but Gray's father told police that his son belongs to the LGBTQ+ community.
""It was very difficult for him to go to school and not get picked on,"" said Colin Gray, 54, about Colt's experience at Apalachee High School. ""It went from one thing to another ... I was trying to get him on the golf team ... [they were, like], 'Oh, look, Colt's gay. He's dating that guy.' They just ridiculed him day after day after day.""
Like his son, Colin faces charges associated with the shooting, including several counts of involuntary manslaughter and second-degree murder because he purchased the weapon used in the killings as a Christmas present for his son last December.
(Related: Did you know that an evangelical Christian school teacher in Ireland was just arrested for refusing to address a male student using ""she"" and ""her"" pronouns?)
Last year when the younger Gray was just 13, the local sheriff's office received a tip from the FBI that Colt ""had possibly threatened to shoot up a middle school tomorrow,"" that threat having been made on the now-deleted Discord platform.
""im committing a mass shooting and im waiting a good 2-3 years,"" Colt allegedly wrote on Discord. ""I cant kill myself yet, cause I'm not contributing anything to culture I need to go out knowing I did.""
In other words, Colt apparently felt his life was worth so little that he planned to contribute to society by ending it, along with ending the lives of others from his high school.
Colt was apparently communicating with someone else on Discord who was in agreement with the plan, writing the words ""I'm ready"" in response to Colt's above text along with a photograph of two guns.
Colt and the other person were reportedly upset about ""the acceptance of transgender people"" in society, meaning they feel as though there is not enough of it.
When Colin spoke to police back in 2023 about his son, he revealed that there was a recent separation from Colt's mother. Colin revealed that Colt's mother ""took his younger two"" children away from him, leaving just Colt behind who at the time was attending Jefferson Middle School.
According to Colin, Colt ""gets flustered under pressure"" and ""doesn't really think straight"" when that happens. At the time when Colin gave Colt the gun for Christmas, Colin says he was trying to teach Colt about weapons and encourage him to do more things outdoors to ""get him away from those video games.""
Colin showed police officers a photo of Colt with blood on his face from shooting a deer. Colin described it as the ""best day ever"" that he got to spend with Colt.
""He knows the seriousness of weapons and what they can do, and how to use them and not use them,"" Colin said, adding that his son talked about school shootings ""quite a bit.""
""You never really know and I don't want anything to happen to him,"" Colin said about Colt at the time.

3477,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-09-30,"'America's Nobel' goes to a power couple who made a startling discovery about HIV
In the early days of the AIDS epidemic, back in the 1980s, the virus was seen as a threat mainly to gay men.
South African husband and wife researchers Salim and Quarraisha Abdool-Karim changed that narrative with their ground-breaking research. They discovered that in South Africa, young women had a high rate of HIV. And then they did something about it.
The couple met at university over a temperature-controlled ultracentrifuge and fell in love. It was a whirlwind romance: A week later Salim was headed to Columbia University in New York. They persisted with a long-distance relationship and just months later were married, with Quarraisha going on to join Salim at Columbia.
Last week, after decades of partnership, in and out of the lab, the epidemiologists received the prestigious Lasker Prize — often referred to as “America’s Nobel” — for their life-saving HIV research.
The power couple won the prize in the public service category “for illuminating key drivers of heterosexual HIV transmission; introducing life-saving approaches to prevent and treat HIV; and statesmanship in public health policy and advocacy,” the Lasker Foundation said in a statement. The honor comes with a $250,000 award.
Growing up as South African Indians under the brutal apartheid system of white-minority rule, the Abdool-Karims faced discrimination and segregation and had limited educational opportunities. Despite this, Salim and Quarraisha — who were both active in the anti-apartheid movement — went on to become two of the foremost scientists of their generation.
One of their major findings came in the early days of the HIV pandemic, in the 1980s, when the disease was seen in the U.S. and Western countries as predominantly affecting gay men. The Abdool-Karims found that in their home country it was predominantly women in their teens getting infected by older men.
The couple set out to find a way for these women to protect themselves — a challenging task. After almost two decades of research, the Abdool-Karims had their breakthrough: their trials of a drug called Tenofovir showed that when used as a vaginal gel, it could help prevent HIV transmission to women.
South Africa has one of the world’s highest number of people living with HIV — an estimated 8 million — but almost 80% of them are now on anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs). New infections have dropped significantly from a peak of around half a million in 2000 to 150,000 last year. The Abdool-Karim's work has contributed in no small part to these successes, according to the Lasker Foundation.
NPR spoke to the Abdool-Karims hours before they attended the prize ceremony in New York on Friday. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.
What barriers did you face entering the sciences in apartheid South Africa?
Salim: Growing up in apartheid South Africa with hindsight is somewhat of a surreal experience.
We lived in an area where only Indian people lived. When we went to the post office, we entered by the door that said non-whites. When we went to the parks, we sat on a bench that said non-whites.
Living in that kind of situation, the message you get over and over and over is that you're not good enough and you are inferior because you are not white. And having grown up in that kind of environment [it] was almost a challenge for us to say, actually, we are good enough.
And eventually, I went to medical school at the University of Natal, which at that stage was the only medical school for Black students. And became an anti-apartheid activist and joined the struggle for freedom. And having graduated as a young doctor, I decided to specialize in virology.
Quarraisha: And maybe I'll add a little bit because I was growing up on the north coast, north of Durban. And it's in the middle of the sugarcane plantations. My great-grandparents came as part of the Indians from India brought to South Africa in 1860 to work on the sugarcane plantations or the coal mines.
But [my family] really valued education. When I finished high school in 1976, I knew I wanted to be a scientist. So I went to the University of Durban and did my BSc [bachelor of science] degree. And during that time, [as I was] studying biochemistry and microbiology, there was an emerging understanding of immunology.
You both studied in the States, then returned to South Africa in the early days of HIV/AIDS. What differences did you see between the two countries?
Salim: What became very clear to us in New York is that HIV is going to be a big problem in Africa. When we came back to South Africa at the end of 1988, we decided that we will pursue research in HIV. And that pretty much defined the rest of our 35 years of research together.
And that’s when you made a startling discovery about HIV.
Salim: Our study that we did back in 1989-1990 produced data that took us quite by surprise. When we looked at the information from this large community survey, we found that in teenage boys, the prevalence of HIV was quite low. But if you looked at teenage girls, they had very high rates of infection [6 to 8% of women between ages 15 and 24 compared to 2% or less of males the same age. However, the rate among men in the 1990 study rises as they get into their mid-to-late 20s.]
That was a signal that these young women were not acquiring HIV from teenage boys; they were acquiring HIV from men who were about 10 years older. And so that started for us a whole research program to understand this age-disparate sex, and essentially laid the basis for research that we focused on, which is, how can we develop a technology that would empower women to protect themselves from HIV? Because, you know, condoms are under the control of men.
Describe what your breakthrough with Tenofovir gel was and how that research progressed since?
Salim: It took 18 years of research before we produced a successful outcome. And when we announced in 2010 that we had shown that this drug called Tenofovir, invented in the 1970s, protected women against HIV when used in a gel [applied vaginally before and after sex]. It provided new hope to the field of HIV at the time. The issue was that the gel was more expensive to make and didn't have the same level of protection as the tablets of Tenofovir. So it turned out that taking Tenofovir pills was as good and sometimes better than the gel and cheaper, and that's what led eventually in 2015 to the World Health Organization recommendation that Tenofovir-containing pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) be offered to all individuals at high risk of infection.
Were there any challenges in getting these young women to take the pill?
Salim: Our problem became that young women were not overly keen to go and stand in a long queue at a clinic to collect tablets to take to prevent a disease they didn't have. And it became a real challenge for us because the uptake of Tenofovir PrEP was quite low. And even those who did start taking Tenofovir tablets for pre-exposure prophylaxis, after a while they just stopped taking it. And so we started a whole new research program to look at developing technologies that were long- acting.
South Africa’s second democratic president, Thabo Mbeki, engaged in AIDS-denialism while the country was in the middle of an epidemic. That must have been disappointing to see?
Salim: It came as a mortal blow in a way that when Mbeki took over from President Mandela, he dallied with these kinds of denialists and was influenced by their thinking and started espousing these falsehoods and this disinformation that HIV was not the cause of AIDS. And you know, we as scientists certainly couldn't just let that lie. We had to ensure that the public was aware of what the factual situation was. I was the head of AIDS research at the Medical Research Council at the time, and so I was often quoted in the media challenging the president and so were many others.
Quarraisha: It was a particularly painful time in that when we first started doing AIDS research in South Africa, we were dealing with a silent epidemic. And at the time Mbeki comes in, we're starting to see the face of AIDS, there were people dying all around us and in large numbers. And in 2000, when we hosted the International AIDS Conference, this is coinciding with the president, the democratically elected president, challenging this.
This year, you’ve been working on a new study with another drug, Lenacapovir, that’s shown impressive results.
Salim: That study showed that if you take the injectable of Lenacapovir [every six months], it was highly effective. In fact, there were no infections in women who took this injection. Young women could come in just once every six months, get an injection, and then they don't need to be concerned about the risk of HIV until they are due for their next injection six months later.
There is a heated debate over the presumed high cost of the injectable.
Salim: What we hope will be done is when it's licensed, it's not yet licensed, is that there will be a kind of access program that will enable poor countries to access lenacapovir at low cost.
What are you going to do with the prize money, and what’s next for you both?
Salim: The prize money will be used for research and/or training of students. We are now working on an annual long-acting prevention technology so that women will only need to have it once a year. (This could be in the form of a matchstick-size implant that has enough Tenofovir in it enough to release slowly over an entire year so that young girls don't need to think about prophylaxis.)
And to end on a lighter note: Salim, you’re widely known by your nickname, “Slim.” Where does it come from?
Salim: I acquired this nickname in high school when my Afrikaans teacher said to me “Jy dink jy is slim” — you think you are clever? — in response to some cheeky comment I must have made. Since my name was Salim, dropping the “a” made it a single syllable, I was the top student in class and I was quite rotund — so, for multiple reasons, her referring to me as “slim” just stuck.

3781,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-07-11,"Finland is offering farmworkers bird flu shots. Some experts say the US should, too
Some experts say the U.S. should vaccinate farmworkers against bird flu.
This is a KFF Health News story.
As bird flu spreads among dairy cattle in the U.S., veterinarians and researchers have taken note of Finland's move to vaccinate farmworkers at risk of infection. They wonder why their government doesn't do the same.
""Farmworkers, veterinarians, and producers are handling large volumes of milk that can contain high levels of bird flu virus,"" said Kay Russo, a livestock and poultry veterinarian in Fort Collins, Colorado. ""If a vaccine seems to provide some immunity, I think it should be offered to them.""
Amon a dozen virology and outbreak experts interviewed by KFF Health News, most agree with Russo. They said people who work with dairy cows should be offered vaccination for a disease that has killed roughly half of the people known to have gotten it globally over the past two decades, has killed cats in the U.S. this year, and has pandemic potential.
However, some researchers sided with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in recommending against vaccination for now. There's no evidence that this year's bird flu virus spreads between people or causes serious disease in humans. And it's unclear how well the available vaccine would prevent either scenario.
But the wait-and-see approach ""is a gamble,"" said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. ""By the time we see severe outcomes, it means a lot of people have been infected.""
""Now is the time to offer the vaccines to farmworkers in the United States,"" said Nahid Bhadelia, director of the Boston University Center on Emerging Infectious Diseases. Even more urgent measures are lagging in the U.S., she added. Testing of farmworkers and cows is sorely needed to detect the H5N1 bird flu virus, study it, and extinguish it before it becomes a fixture on farms -- posing an ever-present pandemic threat.
Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said the agency takes bird flu seriously, and the U.S. is stockpiling 4.8 million doses of the vaccine. But, he said, ""there's no recommendation to launch a vaccine campaign.""
""It's all about risk-benefit ratios,"" Daskalakis said. The benefits are blurry because there hasn't been enough testing to understand how easily the virus jumps from cows into people, and how sick they become. Just four people in the United States have tested positive this year, with mild cases -- too few to draw conclusions.
Other farmworkers and veterinarians working on dairy farms with outbreaks have reported being sick, Russo said, but they haven't been tested. Public health labs have tested only about 50 people for the bird flu since the outbreak was detected in March.
Still, Daskalakis said the CDC is not concerned that the agency is missing worrisome bird flu infections because of its influenza surveillance system. Hospitals report patients with severe cases of flu, and numbers are normal this year.
Another signal that puts the agency at ease is that the virus doesn't yet have mutations that allow it to spread rapidly between people as they sneeze and breathe. ""If we start to see changes in the virus, that's another factor that would be part of the decision to move from a planning phase into an operational one,"" Daskalakis said.
On July 8, researchers reported that the virus may be closer to spreading between people than previously thought. It still doesn't appear to do so, but experiments suggest it has the ability to infect human airways. It also spread between two laboratory ferrets through the air.
In considering vaccines, the agency takes a cue from a 1976 outbreak of the swine flu. Officials initially feared a repeat of the 1918 swine flu pandemic that killed roughly half a million people in the United States. So they rapidly vaccinated nearly 43 million people in the country within a year.
But swine flu cases turned out to be mild that year. This made the vaccine seem unnecessarily risky as several reports of a potentially deadly disorder, Guillain-Barré Syndrome, emerged. Roughly one of every million people who get influenza vaccines may acquire the disorder, according to the CDC. That risk is outweighed by the benefits of prevention. Since Oct. 1, as many as 830,000 people have been hospitalized for the seasonal flu and 25,000 to 75,000 people have died.
An after-action report on the 1976 swine flu situation called it a ""sobering, cautionary tale"" about responding prematurely to an uncertain public health threat. ""It's a story about what happens when you launch a vaccine program where you are accepting risk without any benefit,"" Daskalakis said.
Paul Offit, a virologist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, sides with the CDC. ""I'd wait for more data,"" he said.
However, other researchers say this isn't comparable to 1976 because they aren't suggesting that the U.S. vaccinate tens of millions of people. Rather they're talking about a voluntary vaccine for thousands of people in close contact with livestock. This lessens the chance of rare adverse effects.
The bird flu vaccine on hand, made by the flu vaccine company CSL Seqirus, was authorized last year by the European equivalent of the FDA. An older variety has FDA approval, but the newer variety hasn't gotten the green light yet.
Although the vaccine targets a different bird flu strain than the H5N1 virus now circulating in cows, studies show it triggers an immune response against both varieties. It's considered safe because it uses the same egg-based vaccine technology deployed every year in seasonal flu vaccines.
For these reasons, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and about a dozen other countries are stockpiling millions of doses. Finland expects to offer them to people who work on fur farms this month as a precaution because its mink and fox farms were hit by the bird flu last year.
In contrast, mRNA vaccines being developed against the bird flu would be a first for influenza. On July 2, the U.S. government announced that it would pay Moderna $176 million for their development, and that the vaccines may enter clinical trials next year. Used widely against covid-19, this newer technology uses mRNA to teach the immune system how to recognize particular viruses.
In the meantime, Florian Krammer, a flu virologist at Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine, said people who work on dairy farms should have the option to get the egg-based vaccine. It elicits an immune response against a primary component of the H5N1 bird flu virus that should confer a degree of protection against infection and serious sickness, he said.
Still, its protection wouldn't be 100%. And no one knows how many cases and hospitalizations it would prevent since it hasn't been used to combat this year's virus. Such data should be collected in studies that track the outcomes of people who opt to get one, he said.
Krammer isn't assuaged by the lack of severe bird flu cases spotted in clinics. ""If you see a signal in hospitals, the cat is out of the bag. Game over, we have a pandemic,"" he said. ""That's what we want to avoid.""
He and others stressed that the United States should be doing everything it can to curb infections before flu season starts in October. The vaccine could provide an additional layer of protection on top of testing, wearing gloves, and goggles, and disinfecting milking equipment. Scientists worry that if people get the bird flu and the seasonal flu simultaneously, bird flu viruses could snag adaptations from seasonal viruses that allow them to spread swiftly among humans.
They also note it could take months to distribute the vaccines after they're recommended since it requires outreach. People who work beside dairy cows still lack information on the virus, four months into this outbreak, said Bethany Boggess Alcauter, director of research at the National Center for Farmworker Health.
Health officials have talked with dairy farm owners, but Boggess' interviews with farmworkers suggest those conversations haven't trickled down to their staff. One farmworker in the Texas Panhandle told her he was directed to disinfect his hands and boots to protect cows from diseases that workers may carry. ""They never told us if the cow could infect us with some illness,"" the farmworker said in Spanish.
The slow pace of educational outreach is a reminder that everything takes time, including vaccine decisions. When deciding whether to recommend vaccines, the CDC typically seeks guidance from its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or the ACIP. A consultant to the group, infectious disease researcher William Schaffner, has repeatedly asked the agency to present its thinking on Seqirus' bird flu vaccine.
Rather than fret about the 1976 swine flu situation, Schaffner suggested the CDC consider the 2009-10 swine flu pandemic. It caused more than 274,000 hospitalizations and 12,000 deaths in the U.S. within a year. By the time vaccines were rolled out, he said, much of the damage had been done.
""The time to discuss this with ACIP is now,"" said Schaffner, before the bird flu becomes a public health emergency. ""We don't want to discuss this until the cows come home in the middle of a crisis."""
6104,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-04-29,"Speaking at a ministerial meeting, Shoigu emphasized that Russian forces currently hold the initiative on the front lines, pushing back Ukrainian troops and preventing them from maintaining defensive positions.
Addressing the United States' planned allocation of over $60 billion in military aid to Kyiv, Shoigu expressed skepticism about its impact on the battlefield. He suggested that most of the funds would go toward U.S. military production rather than significantly altering the situation in Ukraine.
Shoigu criticized the U.S. approach, arguing that it effectively condones Ukrainian casualties in the conflict with Russia to serve American interests. ""The American authorities cynically state that Ukrainians will be dying in the fight with Russia for their interests,"" said Shoigu.
The long-awaited, nearly $61 billion military aid package for Ukraine has finally been passed into law by the White House following months of political back-and-forth.
Highlighting Russia's defense production capacity and tactical flexibility, Shoigu reiterated the Defense Ministry's commitment to conducting long-range attacks on logistics hubs and depots supplying Western weapons to Ukraine. (Related: Ukraine running out of air defense missiles, giving Russia a FREE PASS to Kyiv.)
Ukraine rarely comments on the scale of its battlefield fatalities. But in February, President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed that his country had lost 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers on the battlefield. Estimates based on U.S. intelligence indicate the losses are much higher.

Meanwhile, the BBC has verified that Russia's military casualties in Ukraine have surpassed 50,000, marking a grim milestone in the ongoing conflict. Over the past year, as Moscow implemented its aggressive ""meat grinder"" strategy on the front lines, the death toll surged by nearly 25 percent compared to the previous year.
Collaborating with independent media group Mediazona and volunteers, the BBC has meticulously tracked these casualties since February 2022. The investigation involved examining new graves in cemeteries and analyzing open-source data from official reports, newspapers and social media.
According to the BBC's analysis, of the more than 50,000 alleged casualties – which is more than eight times higher than the only official public acknowledgment of fatality numbers given by the Kremlin in September 2022 – about 27,300 are confirmed deaths that occurred in the second year of combat. The BBC further claims that the actual number of Russian deaths is likely to be much higher.
Of the deaths confirmed by the BBC, 9,000 were allegedly Russian prison inmates who were recruited into the military with a promise of freedom after their service. Several thousands more were allegedly volunteers and civilians with little to no military training or experience.
The analysis also does not include the number of deaths of Russian-aligned militia units that come from the disputed territories of Donetsk and Luhansk, internationally recognized as part of eastern Ukraine.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, responding to the BBC's findings, asserted that it is the ""exclusive prerogative of the Ministry of Defense"" to provide information on casualties, because of laws covering state secrets and disseminating information during the Russian special military operation in Ukraine.

5909,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-05-10,"Rising temperatures have made this country the first in modern history to lose all its glaciers.
Venezuela has lost its last glacier, making it the first nation in modern history to hold this unenviable record.
At least five other glaciers have disappeared in the South American country within the last century as climate change drives up temperatures in the Andes. The country lost 98 per cent of its glacial area between 1952 and 2019, research shows.
As of 2011, the Humboldt - also known as La Corona - stood as Venezuela’s last remaining glacier. It has now shrunk so much that climate scientists have reclassified it as an ice field, UK newspaper The Guardian reports.
What exactly is a glacier?
Glaciers are thick masses of frozen ice that move slowly downhill under their own weight, eroding the surrounding land. They are formed when snow gets compacted into ice over many centuries.
Most of the planet's ice is stored in the polar regions, but there are glaciers in some mountainous regions of the tropics - primarily in South America.
The International Cryosphere Climate Initiative (ICCI), a network of experts and researchers, tweeted this week that the Humboldt has become “too small to be classed as a glacier.”
While there is no universal standard to determine how large a mass needs to be to count as a glacier, it is widely accepted that they should cover a minimum of 10 hectares.
Why have Venezuela’s glaciers vanished?
Temperatures are warming faster at the Earth's higher elevations than in lowlands. This has caused Venezuela’s last glacier to decline more quickly than anticipated.
Back in 2019, scientists predicted that the Humboldt could be gone within two decades, but it has already reportedly shrunk to less than two hectares.
The ice sheet is perched within the Sierra Nevada National Park at nearly 5,000 metres above sea level.
Monitoring it has been difficult in recent years due to Venezuela’s tumultuous political situation, with blackouts and gas shortages common and equipment scarce.
But some hardy scientists have taken it upon themselves to maintain data records and monitor how temperatures and plant life are changing in the region.
“The páramos [zone between 3,000 and 4,500 metres of elevation in the Andes] are heating up, climate change is real and we have to document it,” Alejandra Melfo PhD, physics teacher at University of the Andes, said on a research trip in March 2019. “The glacier will disappear and we have to be there when it does.”
What’s the impact of Venezuela’s lost glaciers?
Glacier loss could have a devastating impact on mountain ecosystems.
On the rocks left behind as the Humboldt has retreated, scientists think that a new ecosystem resembling the Páramos - a mist-covered mountain grassland that lies between the top of the treeline and the bottom of the glacier - may eventually begin to develop.
“Temperatures are rising, and vegetation is slowly colonising,” Luis Daniel Llambí, a mountain ecologist at the University of the Andes in Mérida, said on the 2019 research trip.
“There's a race going on between global warming and the vegetation's ability to colonise these high areas. So the high areas of Mérida's mountain range should be number one priority for conservation.”
Between that visit and his last trip in December 2023, the Humboldt shrunk by half.
Similar to those used in Austria and Switzerland in recent years, giant thermal blankets were draped over the glacier by the government in late 2023 in a final attempt to save it, but it was too late.
It is yet to be seen how quickly new soil can form where the ice has melted, and whether plant and animal species will be able to adapt to changing temperatures and potentially having to live at higher elevations.
Though it is a lesser problem in Venezuela, glaciers are also an important source of water in other South American nations.
Indonesia, Mexico and Slovenia could be the next countries to lose their final glaciers, climatologist and weather historian Maximiliano Herrera told The Guardian."

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration’s new Title IX rule expanding protections for LGBTQ+ students has been temporarily blocked in four states after a federal judge in Louisiana found that it overstepped the Education Department’s authority.
In a preliminary injunction granted Thursday, U.S. District Judge Terry A. Doughty called the new rule an “abuse of power” and a “threat to democracy.” His order blocks the rule in Louisiana, which filed a challenge to the rule in April, and in Mississippi, Montana and Idaho, which joined the suit.
The Education Department defended the rule and said it’s reviewing the judge’s order.
“The Department stands by the final Title IX regulations released in April 2024, and we will continue to fight for every student,” the agency said in a statement.
The Louisiana case is among at least seven backed by more than 20 Republican-led states fighting Biden’s rule. The rule, set to take hold in August, expands Title IX civil rights protections to LGBTQ+ students, expands the definition of sexual harassment at schools and colleges, and adds safeguards for victims.
Doughty, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump, is the first judge to block the rule. It deals a major blow to the new protections, which were praised by civil rights advocates but drew backlash from opponents who say they undermine the spirit of Title IX, a 1972 law barring sex discrimination in education.
Louisiana is among several Republican states with laws requiring people to use bathrooms and locker rooms based on their sex assigned at birth, restricting transgender students from using facilities that align with their gender identity. President Joe Biden’s rule clashes with those laws and claimed to supersede them.
The Louisiana lawsuit argued that the new rule would force schools across the four state to pay millions of dollars to update their facilities. In his decision, the judge called it an “invasion of state sovereignty” and concluded that the states were likely to succeed on the merits of the case.
His order says the rule likely violates free speech laws by requiring schools to use pronouns requested by students. It also questions whether the Biden administration has legal authority to expand Title IX to LGBTQ+ students.
“The Court finds that the term ‘sex discrimination’ only included discrimination against biological males and females at the time of enactment,” Doughty wrote in his order.
The judge expressed concern that the rule could require schools to allow transgender women and girls to compete on female sports teams. Several Republican states have laws forbidding transgender girls from competing on girls teams.
The Biden administration has proposed a separate rule that would forbid such blanket bans, but it said the newly finalized rule does not apply to athletics. Still, Doughty said it could be interpreted to apply to sports.
“The Final Rule applies to sex discrimination in any educational ‘program’ or ‘activity’ receiving Federal financial assistance,” he wrote. “The terms ‘program’ or ‘activity’ are not defined but could feasibly include sports teams for recipient schools.”
Judges in at least six other cases are weighing whether to put a similar hold on Biden’s rule. The Defense of Freedom Institute, a right-leaning nonprofit that backed the Louisiana lawsuit, applauded Doughty’s order.
“We are confident that other courts and states will soon follow,” said Bob Eitel, president of the nonprofit and a Trump administration education official.
Biden issued the new rule after dismantling another one created by Trump’s education secretary, Betsy DeVos. That rule narrowed the definition of sexual harassment and added protections for students accused of sexual misconduct.
On the social media platform X on Thursday, DeVos called the Louisiana decision a victory, saying Biden’s “anti-woman radical rewrite of Title IX is not just crazy but it’s also illegal.”

6101,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-05-03,"Temperatures feel even hotter as high humidity reduces people’s ability to stay cool.
Heatwaves have caused school closures for millions of children and triggered health warnings across South and Southeast Asia.
Temperature records don’t show the whole story, however, with high humidity making it much harder for people to keep cool.
These dangerous conditions increase the chances of exhaustion and heatstroke and can even be deadly. Severe heatwaves have already been blamed for almost three dozen deaths across the region.
“Thousands of records are being brutalized all over Asia, which is by far the most extreme event in world climatic history,” weather historian Maximiliano Herrara said in a post on social media site X last week.
Exceptional heat brings school closures and health warnings
Temperatures soared to 44C in parts of Thailand with the capital city Bangkok reaching 40C. The heat index - which measures how hot it actually feels due to humidity - was listed at a “very dangerous” 52C on Tuesday.
New highs over the last month have beaten records set as far back as 1958, according to the Thai Meteorological Department. The district of Lampang saw the highest temperatures so far this year at around 44.2C - just short of Thailand’s all-time record of 44.6C seen in 2016 and 2023.
The weather agency has said it expects this summer to be 1C to 2C warmer on average than it was last year.
In the Philippines, millions of students were told to stay at home on Monday after authorities cancelled classes for two days due to dangerous heat. More than 47,000 schools were ordered to switch to online at-home lessons by the Department of Education.
People were also advised to avoid outdoor activities and stay hydrated, with the elderly and young people particularly vulnerable.
The heat index hit around 45C, according to the country’s meteorological agency. That is within a range it considers “dangerous” as it could trigger heatstroke.
Authorities in Bangladesh have also been forced to close schools twice in the last two weeks as temperatures reached 43C.
Throughout April, a heatwave has been blazing across some parts of India as well. On 21 April, the eastern city of Bhagora hit a high of over 45C. A ‘red alert’” warning was issued by the India Meteorological Department for several eastern and southern states on Tuesday with the weather agency warning that the heat was likely to get worse.
Catastrophic consequences of searing heat
A blistering heatwave in Cambodia - where temperatures have reached 43C this week - may have played a role in an ammunition explosion that killed 20 soldiers at an army base over the weekend.
The country’s defence ministry said the blast on 27 April had been caused by “a technical issue because the weapons are old, faulty and the hot weather”.
Hundreds of thousands of fish have died off in a reservoir in Vietnam’s Dong Nai province. Water levels are reportedly too low for the animals to survive after several weeks without rain. Local communities and media have blamed the mass die-off on drought, the heatwave and problems with reservoir management.
High temperatures are also putting pressure on electricity supplies. Heatwaves have led to increased demand for cooling options like air conditioning. This increased demand for energy has left electricity grids struggling to cope.
Thailand saw overall power usage surge to repeated record highs last week as temperatures soared. In Vietnam and the Philippines, increased demand has threatened to overload electricity grids.
Asia is warming faster than the global average
The El Niño weather phenomenon may be contributing to the heat seen across South and Southeast Asia. Warming in the Pacific Ocean is likely to have impacted weather, and this worsens near the Indian Ocean when the pattern shifts from El Niño to La Niña, which it is doing now.
Experts say the record-breaking conditions are likely down to a combination of global warming and these natural weather cycles.
The World Meteorological Organisation’s (WMO) most recent report revealed that Asia is warming faster than the global average. The warming trend has nearly doubled since the 1961 to 1990 period.
The continent was also the most disaster-hit region in the world last year. In 2023, flood and storm events alone caused more than 2,000 fatalities with more than 9 million people directly affected.
The WMO also noted that, despite growing risks posed by high temperatures, heat-related deaths are often not reported."
3638,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-09-25,"More trans teens attempted suicide after states passed anti-trans laws, a study shows
Anti-trans policies and teen suicide attempts
States that passed anti-transgender laws aimed at minors saw suicide attempts by transgender and gender nonconforming teenagers increase by as much as 72% in the following years, a new study by The Trevor Project says.
The peer-reviewed study, published published Thursday in the journal Nature Human Behavior, looked at survey data from young people in 19 states, comparing rates of suicide attempts before and after bans passed.
Over the past few years, have passed laws affecting how transgender young people do things like play sports, go to the bathroom at school, and access gender-affirming medical care.
The study’s findings are not theoretical for some families.
“You know my child is dead,” Kentucky Senator Karen Berg said at the statehouse during the debate over that state’s anti-trans bill in Feb. 2023. Her transgender son had died by suicide two months earlier at age 24. “Your vote yes on this bill means one of two things: either you believe that trans children do not exist, or you believe that trans children do not deserve to exist.”
The anti-trans bill in Kentucky passed, at least 26 other states now have similar laws on the books.
As these laws were being enacted, there was already a lot of research showing a strong association between anti-transgender policies and negative mental health outcomes, explains Ronita Nath. She runs research at The Trevor Project, which offers 24-7 crisis services LGBTQ+ youth.
Lawmakers and supporters of these laws argued that the evidence of negative mental health effects was weak, she says. “So we clearly knew we needed to very firmly establish causality, and that's why we really prioritized this research,” she explains.
To do that, they gathered data from transgender and nonbinary young people, aged 13-24, from all over the country. “We do social media ads,” says Nath. “Once we reach our sample size in California or New York, we shut those ads down and we amplify the ads in these harder to reach states, let's say Wyoming or Idaho.”
Then, Nath and her colleagues used a sample of 61,240 young people surveyed from 2018-2022, a period during which 19 states passed a variety of anti-trans laws. They looked to see how the rate of attempted suicides in the previous year changed for residents of those states after the laws were passed.
“We found a very sharp and statistically significant rise in suicide attempt rates after enactment of the laws,” she says. A small rise was seen in a state soon after laws were enacted, followed by a sharper rise two or three years later. Among 13-17 year olds, two years after a law took effect, the likelihood of a past-year suicide attempt was 72% higher than it was before passage.
Nath notes a randomized control trial would not be possible for this kind of research, since you can’t randomly assign someone to live in one state or another. Instead, they analyzed the survey data for each state over time, comparing rates before and after laws were passed. The analysis took months, she says, and controlled for a variety of potentially confounding factors in order to isolate the impact of these laws on past-year suicide attempts.
“To see these numbers after everything was taken into account and the model still held — it's terrifying,” she says.
This study is the first of its kind, Nath adds. “These findings demonstrate that — regardless of a person's political beliefs — if you live in a state that has passed an anti-transgender law, transgender, nonbinary young people in your home state are significantly more likely to attempt to take their own life,” she says. “This is the reality for these young people, and it's not acceptable.”
Associate Professor Brittany Charlton of Harvard Medical School, who wasn’t involved with the study, finds it impressive.
“This study is just so important,” she says. “It's contributing to the growing body of evidence that demonstrates that these discriminatory anti-LGBTQ policies have harmful effects on health.” It does so convincingly, she says, with a large sample size and strong research methods.
Nath adds that none of this is inevitable. “Trans and non-binary young people are not inherently prone to increased suicide risk because of their gender identity,” she says. “They are placed at higher risk because of how they're mistreated and stigmatized by others, including by the implementation of discriminatory policies like the ones examined in the study.”
She says future research will explore data from 2023, which saw the largest number of anti-trans state bills to date.

2288,real,ANTI_MIGRATION_AND_XENOPHOBIA,2024-06-08,"11 bodies of migrants who were trying to reach Italy recovered off Libya
ROME (AP) — An aid group said Saturday it recovered the bodies of 11 migrants off the Libyan coast and transferred them to an Italian coast guard ship off Lampedusa island, where thousands are trying to reach from North Africa.
The aid group, Doctors Without Borders, said its Geo Barents rescue ship had recovered the bodies following a search operation that lasted more than nine hours, after being alerted by German humanitarian organization Sea-Watch, which also rescues migrants at sea.
The German group said it was unclear whether the migrants were victims of a previous shipwreck, adding they had tried to contact Libya’s coast guard to recover the bodies but received no reply.
During Saturday’s mission, the Sea-Watch crew also discovered another body.
“As we cannot determine the reason behind this tragedy, we know that people will continue to take dangerous routes in a desperate attempt to reach safety, and Europe must find safe and legal pathways for them,” Doctors Without Borders, also known as MSF, wrote in a post on X.
The MSF vessel was ordered to transport the other 165 people onboard, who were rescued during its Mediterranean operations, to the northern port of Genoa. The group complained that the decision would significantly delay assistance to migrants.
Thousands of migrants leaving from North African countries try to reach Europe using Libya as a departing point, as they brave a dangerous journey across the Mediterranean to escape war and poverty.
The central Mediterranean route remains the world’s most dangerous crossing. In 2023, more than 3,000 people went missing on this route, according to the International Organization for Migration.

3701,fake,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-10-16,"(LifeSiteNews) — The LGBT activist group “World Professional Association for Transgender Health” (WPATH) failed in its pressure campaign to enlist public support for the surgical and chemical mutilation of gender-confused minors, new emails reveal.
The emails are the latest revelation of how WPATH used dubious tactics to boost public support for its “standards of care,” which promote surgeries and drugs for gender-confused minors.
These procedures alter the physical appearance of minors in an attempt to make them they look like the opposite sex, but it is not possible to actually change one’s sex. These drugs can leave individuals permanently infertile (as would be expected with drugs meant to stop normal pubertal development) and have been linked to bone density loss, suicide risk, and other major medical problems.
The surgeries aim to remove healthy organs, including breasts and genitals, thus making individuals permanently infertile.
A pending Supreme Court case, U.S. v. Skrmetti, will determine the legality of Tennessee and Kentucky’s prohibitions on the permanently damaging procedures. A victory for the two states would presumably allow other states to maintain or pass protections for minors.
The group “sought but did not receive the American Academy of Pediatrics’… endorsement for its eighth ‘Standards of Care,'” Leor Sapir with the Manhattan Institute wrote on X (formerly Twitter).
The documents come from a lawsuit concerning Alabama’s protections for gender-confused minors. Alabama has banned the procedures, including surgeries, for minors, leading to a lawsuit from LGBT groups.
Previously, documents from the case have revealed that WPATH described “gender transition” procedures as “medically necessary” in order to get insurance to pay for them, as LifeSiteNews has previously reported.
The emails are from Eli Coleman, the author of the new “standards of care.”
In one message, he “appears to admit that it is misleading to claim that medical groups writing amicus briefs against age restriction laws means these groups endorse SOC-8. WPATH tried but failed to get endorsements,” Sapir wrote.
🚨NEW DOCUMENTS in the Alabama lawsuit over sex “change” age restrictions.
Some very interesting facts now coming to light. 🧵
— Leor Sapir (@LeorSapir) October 9, 2024
Coleman did not respond to two emailed requests for comment sent by LifeSiteNews on October 11 and October 15. LifeSiteNews asked for further context on his comments and examples of when he would recommend against drugs and surgeries for gender-confused minors. He is not a medical doctor.
The emails also show Coleman discussing his “hope” that the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) would endorse WPATH’s standards – an effort that ultimately failed.
“ASPS acknowledged that there is ‘considerable uncertainty as to the long-term efficacy for the use of chest and genital surgical interventions’ and that ‘the existing evidence base is viewed as low quality/low certainty,'” Sapir previously reported.
Coleman also said he wanted to “amplify the voices” of parents who support their children’s transgender procedures. He wrote this in response to seeing “a network of parents who have been concerned about the lack of careful evaluations, lack of involvement in decision making, and perceptions of rushed decisions which they feel account for the increased number of regret cases especially among youth.”
Many people who have formerly lived as “transgender” have indeed shared their frustrations and anger at alleged medical practitioners who led them into drugs and surgeries, including Chloe Cole and Helena Kerschner. Parents of gender-confused minors submitted an amicus brief to the Supreme Court, saying they “were subjected to misinformation and coercion from health care providers attempting to convince them to consent to the interventions.”
Do No Harm, a medical reform group led by physicians, criticized WPATH and said that medical standards should not be decided via lobbying but by independent reviews of data.
The WPATH guidelines “are not true standards of care. Unlikely true medical standards of care, they are not evidence-based based, nor do they capture international consensus,” Do No Harm Senior Fellow Dr. Jared Ross told LifeSiteNews via a media statement.
The LGBT group “is a radical, ideologically motivated advocacy organization masquerading as a physician society,” Ross said. Unlike Eli Coleman, Ross is actually a medical doctor.
He pointed out that the standards were also developed under a pressure campaign from the Biden administration.
Richard “Rachel” Levine is a gender-confused man who presents himself as a woman and currently works as an assistant secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services. Levine and his staff lobbied for the “Standards of Care” to exclude “minimal age criteria” for surgeries, as that could bolster legislative efforts to restrict them, according to information obtained during the Alabama lawsuit.
“Medical consensus should be built upon independent reviews, studies, and analysis of the highest quality data,” Ross told LifeSiteNews.
“Robust meta-analyses and standards of care organically attract the attention and endorsement of other medical organizations,” he stated. “Evidence suggests that minors undergoing the sex-change procedures cataloged by Do No Harm’s Stop the Harm database lead to negative physical and mental health outcomes.”"

In February, Trump had warned he would not respect the US obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty (NATO) to come to another member’s defence, should they have failed to meet their 2% of GDP target in military spending. “Isolationism was not the answer 80 years ago, and it is not the answer today,” said the US President. Russia’s attack on Ukraine is a “stark example” that the fight between authoritarianism and democracy is not over, argued Biden. “We will not walk away. If we do, Ukraine will be subjugated and it will not end there. Ukraine’s neighbours will be threatened, all of Europe will be threatened.” “In their hour of trial, the allied forces of D-Day did their duty. Now the question for us is: in our hour of trial, will we do ours?” he asked. Biden is due to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy later on Thursday, where all things military and financial support to Kiev are expected to be discussed. The Elysée said on Wednesday (5 June) that new announcements on financial support to Ukraine would be made, within the terms of both countries’ bilateral security agreement. It also confirmed that Franco-German armoured vehicle manufacturer KNDS is to open its first factory in Ukrainian.

5884,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-10-22,"Never sworn enemies but not the warmest of neighbors either, Bucharest and Kyiv are today probably closer than they have been in years, if not decades.
The reason? Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Putting aside issues of land and language, Romania is now one of Ukraine's staunchest allies, capped with the two signing a 10-year security agreement in July. Bucharest supplies not only military aid -- although much of it remains hush-hush for security reasons -- but also trains Ukrainian fighter pilots, and soon, marines.
And with Ukrainian trade routes cut off, Romania has also become a key conduit to global markets for Ukrainian grain and other goods.
In part due to that support and the country's proximity to the conflict, Romania, which shares a 650-kilometer-plus border with Ukraine, has registered more Russian military drones flying over or crashing into its territory than any other state on the edge of the conflict, judging by media reports.
Romania, which is spending like never before on defense, is also becoming more strategically integral to NATO amid an eastward shift to face what the Western military alliance deems the biggest threat to European security: Russia.
""I think it's quite clear that Romania's strategic importance has been increasing tremendously since the beginning of the war,"" said Oana Popescu-Zamfir, director of the GlobalFocus Center, a think tank in Bucharest.
""We've been complaining for a long time that there was less attention given to the Black Sea as compared to the northeastern [NATO] flank. And we still feel that there isn't enough and there's not a clear strategy, a clear allied strategy for the Black Sea in the context of Russia's aggressiveness. But, still, a lot of progress has been made,"" Popescu-Zamfir told RFE/RL.
Patriot To The Rescue
A Romanian Defense Ministry spokesperson confirmed to RFE/RL's Romanian Service on October 3 that Ukraine had taken possession of a Patriot air defense system from Bucharest. Romania signed a contract in 2017 with the U.S. company Raytheon and took its first delivery in 2020. It now has just one operational system.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who personally thanked Romania for the delivery, has long appealed for more Patriot systems, arguing that they will help his forces fight almost 3,000 bombs that he said Russia launches into the country every month. Up to now, Ukraine has reportedly operated an estimated five Patriots: two from the United States and three from Germany.
Unlike the Patriot delivery, much of the military hardware Romania has supplied to Ukraine is classified. However, according to media reports and analysts that military aid has included APRA-40 rocket launchers, TAB-71 armored vehicles, and artillery shells.
In addition, Bucharest has started training Ukrainian pilots, as the Ukrainian Defense Ministry confirmed on September 12. Ukraine has been long requesting F-16 fighter jets from its allies to bolster its dwindling fleet of Soviet-era MiGs.
The Ukrainian pilots are training at the European F-16 Training Center (EFTC), which opened in November 2023 at a Romanian military air base near the southeastern town of Fetesti. It will also serve as a regional F-16 training hub for NATO allies and partners.
Romania has also announced plans to train Ukrainian marines. The two-year program is scheduled for Air Base 71, also known as Campia Turzii, in central Romania. The idea was hatched by the Ukraine Defense Contact Group -- also known as the Ramstein group -- which is an alliance of 57 countries (all 32 NATO member states and 25 other countries). Backed by Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, the plan was approved overwhelmingly by Romania's parliament on October 1.
Economically, Romania has also become crucial to Ukraine, one of the world's biggest grain exporters. Ukraine began using Romania's Black Sea port of Constanta after Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 halted shipments from its own Black Sea ports.
It exported 14 million metric tons of grain through Constanta in 2023, roughly 40 percent of the port's entire grain shipments for the year, up from 8.6 million tons in 2022.
However, transit volumes from Constanta fell in the second part of the year after Russia repeatedly struck Ukrainian river ports that li on the other side of the Danube from Romania. Ukraine is also using another route to ship grain, hugging the coast of the Black Sea. That route is now overshadowing Constanta's importance for Ukraine but still highlights the country's growing cooperation.
""The relatively smooth cooperation between Romania and Ukraine in expanding export routes via the Black Sea and Danube Delta has fostered mutual trust. Romania is Ukraine's neighbor that handles by far the biggest volume of agricultural exports,"" said Simon Schlegel, a senior Ukraine analyst at the International Crisis Group.
""While adapting these key export routes to the additional wartime burden was not a frictionless process, Kyiv and Bucharest share an interest in strengthening Romania's port infrastructure,"" Schlegel told RFE/RL in e-mailed remarks.
Romania, NATO Relations Rising
Meanwhile, Romania's relations with NATO have accelerated as well. Bucharest announced earlier this year that upgrade work had begun at the Mihail Kogalniceanu Air Base on the Black Sea. The project, first announced in 2019, aims to transform the base into a major NATO hub, accommodating advanced jet fighters and up to 10,000 NATO troops.
""It's going to be the largest [NATO] base outside of Turkish territory. And the reason this is important is...because Turkey is playing a much more complex game, and sometimes it's not very easy for NATO allies to rely on Turkey, and definitely not for Romania, which feels that the Black Sea remains a closed sea because of Turkey and the way they use the Montreux Convention to make sure that they actually divide influence with Russia in the Black Sea, and don't really allow any other external influence,"" said Popescu-Zamfir, referring to the document regulating maritime traffic through the Turkish Straits.
Despite its membership of NATO, Turkey has been accused of not taking stronger action against Russian naval auxiliary vessels moving through its waters, and the Turkish government has not imposed sanctions on Moscow's seaborne exports.
Moscow is not thrilled with the plan to revamp the air base.
The bigger the NATO base and the ""closer it is to Russia's borders, the more likely it is to be among the first targets for retaliatory strikes,"" Russian Senator Andrei Klimov said in March. ""There won't be any benefit for Romania from this, and there will be more threats. This is a fact.""
Romania is used to such Russian threats. In 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that positioning U.S. missiles in neighboring countries like Romania would lead to retaliatory measures from Russia. His comments came as Romania installed a U.S. missile defense system at the Deveselu military base, also on the Black Sea.
But Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has only triggered more fears, more defense spending, and more integration with NATO and its members. Romania, which joined the alliance in 2004, is allocating a record 19 billion euros ($20.7 billion) in defense spending in 2024, exceeding NATO's spending target of 2 percent of gross domestic product.
Romania now possesses the second largest military on NATO's eastern flank (75,000 troops versus Poland's 122,500), but much of its military hardware is Soviet-era, although that has been changing. In one of the biggest modernizing deals to date, Romania is to acquire 32 F-35 fighter aircraft from the United States, the Pentagon announced in September, in an agreement worth $7.2 billion. In May 2023, Romania retired the last of its MiG jets and now flies mostly F-16s.
Romania's strategic importance on NATO's eastern flank was underscored when the military alliance in March 2022 agreed to deploy battalions to four more eastern NATO members: Romania, along with Bulgaria, Hungary, and Slovakia. They joined the four battalions created by NATO in 2016 and based in (but including personnel from multiple NATO members): Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland -- two years after Russia seized Ukraine's Crimea and began backing separatists in eastern Ukraine.
The two countries have sometimes had fraught relations, and public attitudes in Romania on Ukraine and Russia's war may be mixed thanks in part to history, said Popescu-Zamfir.
Romania lost the northern part of Bukovyna and parts of Bessarabia -- now in today's Ukraine -- in 1940 thanks to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, an agreement between the Nazi and Soviet powers not to attack one other and to divide up Eastern Europe into spheres of influence. It is history that still reverberates today. When Zelenskiy gave a speech in 2019 describing the inclusion of northern Bukovyna in Romania in 1919 after World War I, Romania's Foreign Ministry issued an official protest.
The two countries have also tussled over minority rights. An estimated 151,000 ethnic Romanians live in Ukraine, mainly in the border regions of Chernivtsi and Zakarpattya. That's not counting the estimated 259,000 people living in Chernivtsi and the Odesa region whom Kyiv considers Moldovans, but Bucharest views as Romanians, arguing that the distinction between the two is artificial.
But polling shows most Romanians back their country's inclusion in Western institutions, and Popescu-Zamfir adds that much of the country's political elite are hawkish when it comes to Ukraine.
""I think really now we have a consensus about, essentially, you know, our interests are inextricably linked with Ukraine's,"" Popescu-Zamfir said. ""We're on the same side of things because Russia is on the other side. So that makes things much more black and white, and this is where we need to stand."""
3427,fake,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-09-26,"Nurse Angela from CHD joined Lorenze to provide a video update about her condition, which you can watch at CHD.tv.
In case you missed it, Lorenze lost her vision and suffered horrific bruising all around her forehead and face after she received the vaccine trio. Lorenze did not want to take the shots, but she had to in order to receive a necessary blood transfusion for a rare autoimmune disorder called Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria, or PHD.
""The extremely rare condition affects approximately one in a million people, causing the immune system to attack and destroy red blood cells,"" reports explain about Lorenze's autoimmune condition.
(Related: Did you know that vaccines have destroyed public health and society in such a way that it can never be reversed [apart from an extinction-level event, perhaps].)
Lorenze had traveled all the way across the country from Florida to California to receive the blood transfusion. Doctors at UCI Medical in Orange County where Lorenze went told her that in order to proceed, they needed to first inject her all at once for tetanus, pneumonia and meningitis, otherwise Lorenze would be sent back to Florida without her transfusion.
Desperate for relief, Lorenze complied with UCI Medical's demands. Within just 10 minutes of getting injected, however, Lorenze's vision darkened in both of her eyes. Her jaw also locked up and she started vomiting as her body swelled and bruised seemingly inexplicably.
Administering multiple vaccine injections at once, especially to someone with serious autoimmune disease, is a recipe for health disaster that UCI Medical should have known not to do. They did it anyway, though.
""While it's usually safe for most people to get these vaccines together, in her case, the immune response could have been too much and led to complications,"" commented Dr. Raj. Dasgupta, chief medical advisor for Fortune Recommends Health.
""To avoid overloading her system, it would be reasonable to space out the vaccines and closely monitor for any worsening symptoms.""
Better yet, how about not taking the vaccines at all under any timeframe? The body has an immune system for a reason, and injecting vaccine chemicals into it only damages its ability to fight disease naturally.
One silver lining is that Lorenze is said to be doing a lot better than she was. CHD uploaded a video update on Sept. 23, 2024, that shows Lorenze speaking about her improvements:

5361,real,ANTI_MIGRATION_AND_XENOPHOBIA,2024-07-27,"Tucson — Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign chief has signaled that Harris, if elected in November, would continue President Biden's asylum crackdown, which U.S. officials have credited for a steep drop in migrant crossings along the southern border.
In an exclusive interview with CBS News, Harris' campaign manager, Julie Chávez Rodríguez, was asked if the vice president would keep the partial ban on asylum claims that Mr. Biden enacted in June through a presidential proclamation.
""I think at this point, you know, the policies that are, you know, having a real impact on ensuring that we have security and order at our border are policies that will continue,"" Chávez Rodríguez responded.
Chávez Rodríguez's comments inside a restaurant in Tucson, Arizona are the first indication that U.S. border policy may not change significantly if Harris succeeds Mr. Biden as president, despite pressure from progressive activists angry with the Biden administration's pivot on asylum. Following Mr. Biden's decision to abandon his reelection bid, Harris has become the presumptive Democratic candidate who will face former President Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, in November.
Citing a presidential authority often invoked by Trump during his administration, Mr. Biden in early June suspended the entry of most migrants crossing the southern border, disqualifying those who enter the U.S. illegally from asylum. The policy, which is being challenged in court by migrant advocates, marked a sweeping change by an administration that came into office promising to ""restore"" the U.S. asylum system but quickly found itself facing record numbers of border crossings.
U.S. officials have credited the partial asylum ban for accelerating a months-long drop in illegal crossings at the southern border this year. In June, the number of migrants apprehended by Border Patrol fell to a 3-year low, and migrant arrivals plunged further in July, which is on track to see the lowest level of illegal border crossings since the fall of 2020, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News.
Chávez Rodríguez noted the dramatic reduction in border crossings on Friday.
""As a result of actions they've taken, we have seen,"" she said, ""a record drop in migration.""
""Trump continues to play politics with this issue""
Immigration has emerged as a major issue on the campaign trail, with polls finding it is among the most pressing concerns among American voters.
Trump and other Republicans had been seeking to make Mr. Biden's immigration record a defining issue in the race for the White House, faulting him for the unprecedented levels of migrant apprehensions recorded in the past three years. Now that she's the likely Democratic presidential nominee, Harris is facing similar political attacks.
In March 2021, Harris was tasked by Mr. Biden with leading his administration's effort to reduce poverty, violence and corruption in Central America through diplomacy and investment in the region. She has not overseen the administration's border policy.
Still, Harris' immigration role in the Biden White House has garnered withering criticism from Republicans, who have dubbed her the ""border czar"" and accused her of not being sufficiently engaged on the issue.
Asked how Harris would respond to her critics on immigration, Chávez Rodríguez said Harris is focused on ""real solutions"" to the border woes that have bedeviled Democratic and Republicans alike, citing the bipartisan border security agreement that the White House forged with a group of senators earlier this year. Without enough Republican support, that deal failed twice in the Senate.
""As a result of Donald Trump saying that he didn't want Republicans to pass it, it failed,"" Chávez Rodríguez said. ""And we know we need to bring forward solutions, while Donald Trump continues to play politics with this issue.""
""We know at the end of the day the only way to really modernize our immigration system and secure our border is for Congress to pass common-sense immigration legislation,"" Chávez Rodríguez added.
Trump has promised a radical shift on immigration if voters return him to the White House. He has vowed to carry out the largest deportation campaign in U.S. history, including by deputizing the National Guard to conduct immigration enforcement. He has also said he would impose ideological screenings on legal immigrants, militarize the border and terminate birthright citizenship for the children of unauthorized immigrants."

If Your Time is short
V-safe participants self-report adverse health impacts after COVID-19 vaccination, but v-safe data does not show whether COVID-19 vaccination caused those symptoms.
The self-reported data has not been verified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Learn more about PolitiFact’s fact-checking process and rating system.
A collection of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data is being characterized as if it proves COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous.
""Covid vaccine injuries exposed in newly uncovered data,"" declared multiple April 5 Facebook posts that linked to an article by American Military News, a publication about the U.S. military and foreign affairs, published the same day. That article cited information from an Epoch Times story that said data released by the CDC shows 780,000 vaccine injury reports were made after individuals were vaccinated against COVID-19.
The Epoch Times, a news outlet tied to China’s religious movement, Falun Gong, has a history of sharing misinformation; PolitiFact has rated some of its past claims about COVID-19 vaccines False and Pants on Fire.
These posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.)
The data these posts refer to is from v-safe, a CDC COVID-19 monitoring system that lets people self-report health symptoms weekly for six weeks following COVID-19 vaccination.
In 2022, the Informed Consent Action Network, a Texas-based anti-vaccine group, filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, seeking public release of CDC data from more than 10 million people who used the system to self-report symptoms from December 2020 to September 2022.
After the CDC released the data, the group created an interactive visualization of this data on its website showing that more than 780,000 people said they required medical care after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.
But public health officials said it’s inaccurate to characterize the data as proof of causation.
Martha Sharan, a CDC spokesperson, told PolitiFact that the adverse events reported in v-safe have not been verified by the CDC as having been caused byCOVID-19 vaccines. To verify the symptoms’ causes, an individual’s medical histories and records would have to be reviewed.
CDC spokesperson Nick Spinelli said his agency called v-safe participants who reported receiving medical care after vaccination and encouraged them to submit a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System report.
The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, also called VAERS, is another CDC safety monitoring system that allows anyone to submit reports about post-vaccination health effects. Researchers use it as a means of detecting possible trends that could merit a closer look. But none of the reports themselves constitute verified cases of vaccine-related symptoms or injury.
""V-safe is not designed to capture reports of unusual events, but more common symptoms like fevers, chills, or sore throats,"" Kawsar Talaat, a co-director of clinical research for the Institute of Vaccine Safety said in a story published by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""You cannot take the material from one of these systems and expand it beyond the limitations of the data collection.""
A 2022 peer-reviewed study of COVID-19 vaccines using v-safe data published in The Lancet, a peer-reviewed medical journal, found that individuals seeking medical care after an mRNA vaccine were rare. V-safe surveys also did not ask participants which symptoms led them to seek medical care.
Studies of COVID-19 vaccines have found them to be safe and effective by public health officials around the world. Adverse effects are rare, and the World Health Organization estimated that COVID-19 vaccines saved about 14.4 million lives worldwide in 2021 alone.
We rate the claim that COVID-19 vaccine injuries were exposed in newly uncovered data False.

5375,real,ANTI_MIGRATION_AND_XENOPHOBIA,2024-10-28,"Thirty-five percent of Americans say the top priority for the first 100 days of the next presidency should be migration, according to an Ipsos survey for Reuters.
That one-on-three score is more than three times the 11 percent share of the second-ranked “First 100 Days” priority — income inequality.
Taxes — and health care — score only a 10 percent share.
The priority rankings are very different from what voters say when they are asked about the most important issues, Ipsos noted:
The economy is the seen as the most important problem [for Washington, DC] for 27% of registered voters, followed by political extremism or threats to democracy (22%), and then immigration (16%).
The First 100 Days answer suggests that President Kalama Harris might quickly press Congress to pass a law that would raise immigration levels under the guise of improving border security.
But those survey results also suggest that a reelected President Donald Trump will face pressure to focus on curbing migration. That focus would be different from his first term when he quickly pivoted away from migration and pushed a large tax cut through Congress.
That 2017 shift followed pressure from Trump’s business allies, many who still demand that government invite more economic migrants.
“The U.S. economy needs immigration, and the ebb and flow of humans [across the border] is the market responding to demand,” the Wall Street Journal declared Sunday. “The Biden administration’s decision to use legal parole to accept 30,000 migrants a month from Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti, and Nicaragua is a common-sense and humane approach to managing migration,” it declared.
If Trump is in the Oval Office, Democrats — and some Republicans — will resist his promise of mass deportations.
But many Republicans recognize they need to fulfill campaign promises.
“There’s about 4.5 million who would be the first priority for that, people who’ve already committed crimes,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) said on October 24. “They’re in the system now [for] shoplifting, or whatever it is … or [having] done things that are untoward or unlawful.”
“We’ve got 20, 25 million illegal aliens who are here in the country. What do we do with them?” Sen. JD Vance said in his October 1 Vice Presidential debate. “I think the first thing that we do is we start with the criminal migrants. About a million of those people have committed some form of crime, in addition to crossing the border illegally.”
Any debate about migration levels will likely include a debate over the damage caused to ordinary Americans’ workplace productivity and their declining family fertility.
In Canada and the United Kingdom, birth rates have crashed amid wage cuts and housing spikes caused by advocates for more migration. Bloomberg reported Monday:
The fertility rate in England Wales fell to a record low in 2023, as financial pressures and wider societal shifts put young people off starting a family.
Women had an average of 1.44 children, the lowest figure since records began in 1938 and down sharply since 2010 when the rate was 1.94, data from the Office for National Statistics showed on Monday. In London the rate was even lower at 1.35.
The figures will set off alarm bells over a worsening demographic crisis that is set to ramp up the pressure on the workforce and the public finances. The national level is well below the natural replacement rate of 2.1
In contrast, Larry Fink, the head of the $10 trillion Blackrock investment group, has urged governments to reduce the migration that is used to inflate their consumer economies and to instead raise the productivity of their nation’s citizens.
“We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth,” Fink said at a pro-globalist event in April hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued:
But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations.
Canada’s government has recently trimmed its massive immigration inflow, boosting bankers’ hopes that Canadian companies will redirect funds to raise the nation’s stalled productivity.
“We need to dispel the narrative that slower population growth will be bad for the economy,” said an October 24 report by Robert Kavcic, the senior economist at BMO, a major bank based in Montreal. “Real GDP per capita has been stagnant on balance since 2016 … One can argue that the surge in [migrants] has diverted resources to housing and allowed firms to lean on low-cost labour, at the expense of productivity,” Kavcic wrote."
5666,fake,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-07-04,"Syrskyi is reportedly facing dismissal for refusing to carry out Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's orders for a ground offensive, which the army chief has deemed ""futile.""
According to Eurasia Daily, Syrskyi was ordered to launch a major offensive but declined, arguing that without proper equipment and air support, such a counteroffensive would result in heavy casualties.
The reports shed light on the recent scandal involving Maryana Bezuhla, a member of the Verkhovna Rada – Ukraine's parliament. Bezuhla recently criticized Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin for not granting her permission to travel to the frontline. She claimed this restriction hindered her from exercising her constitutional rights. The reason for the lawmaker's desire to visit the frontline remains unclear, but the dispute between Zelensky and Syrskyi could be a contributing factor.
Bezuhla has been vocal about the need for transparency and accountability within the Ukrainian military. Her attempts to visit the frontline were reportedly to assess the situation firsthand and ensure that military operations were being conducted efficiently and ethically. (Related: Military analyst: Zelensky established drone unit in Ukrainian Armed Forces to SWINDLE MORE MONEY)
The refusal to grant her access has sparked debates within the parliament about the balance of power between military leadership and civilian oversight.

The tension between Zelensky and Syrskyi also reflects broader issues within the Ukrainian government and military. Syrskyi's concerns about inadequate equipment and air support highlight ongoing challenges in Ukraine's defense strategy.
Syrskyi was instrumental in some of Ukraine's significant victories against Russia and played a pivotal role in the successful defense of Kyiv during the early days of the conflict.
Born in the Russian city of Novinki during the time of the former Soviet Union in July 1965, Syrskyi studied in the Red Army's Higher Military Command School in Moscow. In the 1980s, he was deployed to the former Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Following the Soviet Union's collapse, he elected to remain in Ukraine, studying at the country's National Defense University and joining the ranks of the newly independent Armed Forces of Ukraine.
Syrskyi's appointment as commander-in-chief is not surprising, given his extensive experience and capability to succeed his popular predecessor, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi. In 2014, he commanded Ukrainian troops fighting a Moscow-backed insurgency in the eastern Donetsk region, earning the call sign ""Snow Leopard."" By 2019, he headed Ukraine's land forces and led the country into war when Russia invaded in February 2022. He was named a ""Hero of Ukraine"" for his successful defense of Kyiv.
In July 2022, Syrskyi executed a counteroffensive that pushed Russian troops away from Kharkiv and reclaimed large areas in the east and southeast. Two months later, he orchestrated a significant counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region, enabling Kyiv to retake Kupiansk and Izium.
Syrskyi also led the prolonged and bloody Bakhmut operation, criticized for its high Ukrainian casualties but praised for supposedly exhausting Russian forces and resources in the region.
His frontline successes have earned him the support of his soldiers, whom he frequently visits to boost morale. However, as the war shifts from triumphs to attrition, Syrskyi now faces the challenge of overseeing the conflict's most difficult phase. Entering its third year, the war strains Ukrainian lines with shortages of ammunition and fresh personnel, while Russian forces aim to advance.

BERLIN (AP) — Efforts to fight public sector corruption are faltering around the world, in part because a “global decline in justice and the rule of law since 2016,” according to a corruption index released Tuesday.
Transparency International, which compiles the annual Corruption Perceptions Index, found 23 countries at their worst level since the global ranking began almost three decades ago, including both high-ranking democracies and authoritarian states.
On the reported decline in justice, the group said that “the rise of authoritarianism in some countries contributes to this trend, and even in democratic contexts, the mechanisms that keep governments in check have weakened.”
“Corruption will continue to thrive until justice systems can punish wrongdoing and keep governments in check,” Transparency International chair François Valérian said in a statement. He added that “leaders should fully invest in and guarantee the independence of institutions that uphold the law and tackle corruption.”
The organization measures the perception of public sector corruption according to 13 data sources including the World Bank, the World Economic Forum and private risk and consulting companies. It ranks 180 countries and territories on a scale from a “highly corrupt” 0 to a “very clean” 100.
Among the countries hitting their lowest level were relatively high-scoring democracies such as Iceland, the Netherlands, Sweden and Britain. Authoritarian countries including Iran, Russia and Venezuela also dropped.
Denmark led the index with the highest score for the sixth consecutive year, with 90. It was followed by Finland with 87 and New Zealand with 85. The others in the top 10 were Norway, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany and Luxembourg.
The United States was unchanged with a score of 69, putting it in 24th place.
At the other end, Somalia again had the weakest score with 11. It was followed by South Sudan, Syria and Venezuela with 13 each; Yemen with 16; and Equatorial Guinea, Haiti, North Korea and Nicaragua with 17 each.
The global average was unchanged at 43 for the 12th consecutive year, and more than two-thirds of countries scored below 50.
The report found “little to no meaningful progress” toward curbing corruption in the Asia-Pacific region, and expressed concerns about “opacity and undue influence” in justice systems in Latin America and the Caribbean.
Arab countries’ average score on the index hit an all-time low of 34, and sub-Saharan Africa remained stagnant at 33.
Even in western Europe and the European Union, the best-performing region, Transparency International found that “weak accountability and political corruption are diminishing public trust and enabling narrow interest groups to exert excessive control over political decision-making.”
It pointed to “weaknesses in judicial systems” in Poland, with a score of 54, and Hungary with 42.
On Poland, the report noted the previous governing party’s “systematic efforts ... to monopolize power at the expense of public interest.” It acknowledged the new government’s commitment to uphold the rule of law, but said the ousted governing party continues to exert “considerable influence” over the judiciary.
Ukraine, with a score of 36, continued an 11-year improvement despite Russia’s invasion by focusing on reforms of the judicial system, which are an element of its bid to join the EU. But the report said that “the existence of a significant number of high-level corruption cases remains a major concern.”
Russia’s score dropped to 26. Transparency International said that the government’s “pervasive control of public institutions facilitates the widespread abuse of power without accountability” while judicial independence is eroding."
3020,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-06-13,"Prolonged ice-free periods putting Hudson Bay polar bear population at risk of extinction: Study
Polar bears' primary prey, the ringed seal, are also at risk.
A segment of the polar bear population is at risk of extinction should ice-free periods continue to get longer, researchers have determined using analysis of the sea ice as well as the health of the bears themselves.
Ice-free periods in Canada's Hudson Bay have been lengthening over the past few decades, scientists say. Global warming is projected to extend the ice-free periods even more, reducing the ability for the region's resident polar bear population to hunt, putting them at risk of extinction if greenhouse gas emissions continue at projected levels, a study published in Communications Earth & Environment on Thursday found.
The Hudson Bay is historically one of the few places in the Arctic where polar bears have routinely come ashore when all of the sea ice has melted, Geoff York, senior director of research and policy of Polar Bears International and co-author of the paper, told ABC News.
What used to be an ice-free period of about four months has now extended far beyond, to the point that the polar bears in the southern and western Hudson Bay have been stretched to the point of genetic adaptation and the length of time they can fast, York said. Today's Hudson Bay polar bears are spending five weeks or longer on land than their grandparents did, York said.
Collar cameras strapped to Hudson Bay polar bears showed that the longer extents of ice-free periods are putting the Hudson Bay polar bears at risk of starvation, according to a paper published in Nature earlier this year.
Polar bears that were forced to find food on land -- by foraging on berries and eating birds -- lost about the same amount of weight as the bears that simply fasted, proving that to these bears, food on land had nowhere near the same amount of nutrients as seals, which are full of fat and blubber, the researchers found.
""Their primary food sources require them to be out on the sea ice,"" Alex Crawford, assistant professor at the University of Manitoba's Department of Environment and Geography and co-author of the paper, told ABC News. ""So that means that if they are spending [a] longer time on land in the summer, they are spending a longer amount of time effectively fasting.""
The early disappearance of sea ice, now in the late spring and early months, occurs at the same time that pups are being born and when mother bears put on most of their fat that will get them through the winter, York said. Putting them on shore early puts them in a precarious body condition for the upcoming cold months.
""Females are going to be less successful taking a pregnancy to term,"" York said. ""Even if they do carry it to term, they'll be less successful in raising those cubs in the first year.""
Between 1.6 degrees Celsius and 2.6 degrees Celsius of warming since pre-Industrial times is the range in which the Hudson Bay polar bears are expected to go extinct, Crawford said.
""That low end, we're knocking on the door of that already,"" Crawford said.
The paper brings together the latest climate models with two components that greatly affect polar bear survivability -- snow depth and ice thickness -- for the first time, York said. Ringed seals, polar bears' primary source of prey, need adequate snow depth to successfully den and protect their young in the springtime.
Even when accounting for bias in the climate models, the paper's findings were still grim, Crawford said.
Predictions made in the early ‘90s about warming impacts on polar bears are happening sooner than expected, York said.
Researchers have observed ""dramatic"" drops in the Hudson Bay subpopulation of up to 26% in the last decade, York said. There are only about half the number of polar bears in the population than 40 years ago.
""That decline is already kind of in progress, and if anything, I think now we'll see it likely accelerating,"" York said.
There is a chance for the sea ice to recover drastically, Crawford said.
If greenhouse gas emissions were to stop altogether, the extent of the sea ice could reverse in just a matter of years, Crawford said."

3093,fake,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-02-11,"Will the United States Halt Peace Talks Between Russia and Ukraine?
In his highly publicized interview with right-wing journalist Tucker Carlson, Russian President Vladimir Putin revealed that Russia has never rejected the idea of reaching a peace agreement to end the conflict in Ukraine.
He informed Carlson that Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky “issued a decree prohibiting negotiations with us [Russia],” which was likely the product of Western pressure on Ukraine.
Let him cancel that decree. And that’s it. We have never refused negotiations indeed. We hear all the time, is Russia ready? Yes. We have not refused. It was them who publicly refused. Well, let him cancel his decree and enter into negotiations. We have never refused,” Putin stated.
At the end of the day, the West is not interested in negotiations to end this conflict. Since Russia launched its military invasion on February 24, 2022, the West has waged a proxy war against Russia in Ukraine. Instead of trying to promote peace talks, the US and its NATO allies have been arming Ukraine to the hilt in an attempt to drag Russia into a geopolitical quagmire. The goal here is to fight Russia to the last Ukrainian.
That said, this geopolitical scheme has failed colossally due to Russia being a far larger and more combat experienced actor than Ukraine.
The longer this conflict goes on, the more likely Ukraine will cease to exist as a coherent nation. Only a negotiated settlement will bring peace in this war-torn region.

5615,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-11-11,"COP29: The state of the climate in eight charts
World leaders gather in Baku to discuss the climate crisis, and funding. We break down figures on climate change in eight key graphs.
The 29th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP29) began in Baku, Azerbaijan on November 11.
World leaders, climate experts, and campaigners will engage in discussions on climate crisis until November 22.
At the heart of the discussions in Baku is the climate finance goal, which seeks to establish a target for financial support directed towards developing countries — funding considered essential for helping these nations reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.
Preliminary assessment indicate that 2024 will almost certainly be the hottest year on record, beating the high set in 2023.
And for the first time, the globe this year reached more than 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming compared to the pre-industrial average, the European climate agency Copernicus said last week.
The European Union, alongside major historical emitters like the US and UK, has cut greenhouse gas emissions by about one-third since 1990.
Despite this, global CO2 emissions have steadily increased from 22.6 million metric tonnes (Mton) in 1990 to 39.02 Mton in 2023, according to UN data.
China's emissions have risen to 13.2 Mton in 2023, reflecting the country's growing contribution to global emissions.
Large countries like China, the US, and India are the biggest total CO2 emitters, but nations on the Arabian Peninsula lead in per-capita emissions.
European Union data shows that Qatar has the highest per-person emissions, followed by Kuwait, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.
Many countries have longer-term, global targets of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.
In 2023, the EU had reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 34 per cent from 1990 levels. However, it is still far from its goal of climate neutrality by 2050.
In the EU, every sector saw a reduction in GHG emissions in 2023 compared to 2022.
The power sector experienced the most significant decline, with emissions dropping by 20.1%. The industrial combustion and processes sector followed closely, with emissions falling by 8.1% from the previous year.
Data shows that fossil fuels remain a dominant energy source in most countries, though there is a noticeable rise in renewable energy usage across the globe, particularly in regions like Europe, the United States, and China.
In the first six months of 2024, half of the EU's electricity came from renewable sources, outperforming fossil fuels, according to the European Commission.
In 2023, The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the leading international body for assessment of climate change, outlined five potential future scenarios to model global temperature changes up to 2100, based on various factors like population growth and CO2 emissions.
The most hopeful scenario, SSP1-1.9, predicts a rise of just 1.4°C, achieved through significant emission reductions.
In contrast, if greenhouse gas emissions remain at current levels and net zero is not reached by 2100, global temperatures could increase by more than 2°C, as projected by SSP2-4.5.
In the most alarming scenario, SSP5-8.5, global temperatures could soar by 4.4°C on average, driven by a doubling of current emission levels."

COVID-19 vaccines are injuring and killing people, and it’s not just the victims and their families who are hurting; insurance companies could see their profits dwindle as more cases come to light in a trend that could end up putting the entire economy at risk.
University College Dublin School of Medicine Professor of Translational Science Dr. Dolores Cahill, an immunology expert who has 25 years of experience working with antibodies in biomedical applications, has long been voicing her concerns about the jabs and the impact they will have on global health. She doesn’t just think they’re risky; she firmly believes that everyone who has received even a single dose is walking around with a ticking time bomb inside of them and is headed for certain death.
“Everybody who has an mRNA injection will die within 3 to 5 years, even if they have had only one injection,” she said. Naturally, these comments, which she has been making since the vaccines first rolled out, were enough to get her labeled a “conspiracy theorist” and removed from social media platforms.
Another expert who thinks the writing is on the wall is Belgian virologist Dr. Geert Vanden Bossche, who has been warning that those who were fully vaccinated will start to see their immunity collapse, which could spur a global trend of turbo cancers, strokes, heart attacks and mortalities.
He said that a “massive, massive tsunami” is poised to overwhelm hospitals and take a toll on the economy. This, in turn, will spur social chaos and affect all of us.
“They will start to replace the surge of the cancers … now we have a more chronic phase.”
“It will end with a hyper-acute phase, a huge, huge wave … I’ve been studying this now for four years. I know what I’m talking about … We will have to build a completely new world,” he stated, adding that our hospitals will collapse once this gets into full swing.
“And that means the chaos in all kinds of layers of society — financial, economic, social, you name it — will be complete.”
All of this is bad news for insurance companies and pretty much every industry that needs living, breathing workers, but there are a couple of industries that might actually benefit from all this.
In a post that has now disappeared, Richard Sauder of “Richard’s Substack” noted: “It appears that casket and coffin manufacturers, funeral homes, morticians, morgues, graveyards, cemeteries, backhoe operators and grave diggers, crematoriums and the like will have plenty of work – if they can avoid dying themselves!”
“Other industries and the great bulk of the work force will take it on the chin.”
Although he felt he shouldn’t name names, he implied that one famous insurance company is “in very serious trouble” and is “swirling around the corporate failure drain due to the burgeoning death rate.” And if a major company is being affected this much, it’s hard to imagine how it will affect smaller insurers.
“Too many people are dying,” he said. “The normal actuarial tables no longer apply.”

6168,fake,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-05-15,"America should take notes…
On Tuesday, the Peruvian government officially categorized both transgender and intersex people as “mentally ill.”
The decree, signed by President Dina Boluarte, notes that “transsexualism, dual-role transvestism, gender identity disorder in childhood, other gender identity disorders and fetishistic transvestism” are now all recorded as mental illnesses in Peru, as Daily Mail reported.
The Peruvian government insisted that this will help make “psychological treatment” more freely available to those struggling with these identity and ideology disorders. Now in Peru, people who experience confusion when it comes to their body and identity can receive free health services for said confusion. The shift “categorically reaffirms respect for the dignity of the person and their free actions within the framework of human rights, providing health services for their benefit.”
The move, as Daily Mail indicated, came out just days before the 34th anniversary of when the World Health Organization (WHO) removed “homosexuality” from the list of International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Additionally, the word “transexuality” was removed from the list in 2019.
But to Peru, those identity terms are now considered mental health illnesses.
A report from Yahoo News included a quote from Percy Mayta-Tristán, a medical researcher at Lima’s Scientific University of the South.
“You can’t ignore the context that this is happening in a super-conservative society, where the LGBT community has no rights and where labeling them as mentally ill opens the door to conversion therapy,” he said.
Critics noted that this new policy would open the door to conversion therapy. But that begs the question, if you’re converting from a delusion, isn’t that good?
In response to the news, users on X seemed to be supportive of the move.
“I never thought I would see the day Peru was more advanced then the US,” a user wrote on X, while another wrote, “truth hurts.”
A different user noted that Peru is “making public what most people are thinking” and said “Good for Peru” Similarly, others said things like “they’re right” and “well done Peru.”
I wonder when, if ever, the United States will do the same."

TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Dozens of Georgians stood in tearful silence in a central square near parliament last week to mourn Kesaria Abramidze, a transgender actor and model who was stabbed to death the previous day in her apartment.
Alongside flowers and candles, some carried banners that read, “Hate kills.”
Some in the conservative South Caucasus nation see a direct line between violent attacks, such as the one on the 37-year-old Abramidze, and a sweeping measure that severely restricted LGBTQ+ rights which was given final approval by parliament a day before the slaying. Activists fear the measure could increase hate crimes.
The bill, introduced by the ruling Georgian Dream party, includes bans on same-sex marriages, adoptions by same-sex couples and public endorsement and depictions of LGBTQ+ relationships and people in the media. It also bans gender-affirming care and changing gender designations in official documents.
The events were a chilling reminder of the vulnerability of LGBTQ+ people in the country of 3.7 million where the Orthodox Church wields significant influence.
“We have been saying all along, all these months, that laws like this are going to cause violence and are going to increase the number of people that are physically attacked,” Tamar Jakeli, the head of Tbilisi Pride, told The Associated Press at the vigil.
“We are quite desperate, honestly,” Jakeli added. “We don’t know how we can survive in this country under this law, under this government.”
Concerns about Russian influence
Because the measure echoes similar laws in Russia, some Georgians fear they are being drawn further into Moscow’s orbit after more than three decades of independence following the collapse of the USSR.
Authorities in both countries believe the laws protect “traditional family values” from what they call dangerous foreign influence.
Georgian Dream introduced the anti-LGBTQ+ bill shortly after parliament adopted a law in June that requires media and nongovernmental organizations to register with authorities if they get more than 20% of their funding from abroad. This is similar to a Russian measure that the Kremlin uses against its critics and other dissenters.
For years, Moscow has sought to bring Georgia back under its influence, fighting a brief war in 2008 over a breakaway province. The decade-long rule of Georgian Dream -– a party created by shadowy billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in Russia -– has raised concerns it is acting in concert with the Kremlin.
Many ordinary Georgians supported Ukraine as Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion in 2022. But Georgia’s government refused to impose sanctions on Moscow, barred Kremlin critics from entering the country, and accused the West of trying to drag Tbilisi into the conflict.
Georgia’s “foreign influence” law ignited mass protests, with critics saying it threatened democracy and jeopardized Georgia’s bid to join the European Union.
Georgian Dream pressed ahead anyway, approving the anti-LGBTQ+ bill. The measure still could be vetoed by President Salome Zourabichvili, long at odds with the party, but it has enough seats to override her the same way it did with the foreign influence law.
The EU’s criticism and Georgia’s response
After the foreign influence law passed, the EU halted Georgia’s effort to join the bloc that began in 2022 and froze some financial support. The U.S. also imposed sanctions on government officials and parliament members.
The anti-LGBTQ+ measure further deepened that rift. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said it “will undermine the fundamental rights of the people, increasing discrimination and stigmatization.”
Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze replied that such criticism “will not benefit the image of the European Union within Georgian society.”
“In our perception, Europe represents transparency, traditional, Christian values. For centuries, Georgians have strived toward Europe because we were united by shared Christian traditions and culture,” Kobakhidze said, arguing the measure protects families and minors.
It is seen as a populist step to win conservatives’ support in the Oct. 26 parliamentary election in which Georgian Dream seeks to maintain its dominance.
“They are just using the same methods and means and tools Russia is using -– to somehow … take people’s attention (away) from the real problems and create a new enemy somewhere within the society, and then defeat that enemy that doesn’t really exist,” said Giorgi Davituri of the Institute for Development of Freedom of Information in an AP interview.
A setback for the vulnerable LGBTQ+ community
The sweeping restrictions on LGBTQ+ rights and representation mirror those adopted in Russia over the last decade, packaged into one crippling blow.
Some of them, like the ban on same-sex weddings, cement existing Georgian law that defines marriage as a “voluntary union between a man and a woman.” Others, like the ban on gender-affirming medical care or changing one’s gender in documents, drives an entire social group, such as trans people, to the fringes.
“Everybody is really under threat, but trans people are the most vulnerable,” said Tbilisi Pride’s Jakeli, because the legislation bans “any kind of physical intervention which is needed for trans people to continue living.”
Giorgi Gogia, associate director of the Europe and Central Asia division at Human Rights Watch, told AP the legislation’s impact may be far-reaching, limiting multiple rights, including to health care, peaceful assembly and education.
It’s at odds with Georgia’s laws that ban discrimination based on gender identity, among other things, Gogia said.
More dangerously, it “perpetuates already existing negative stereotypes about LGBTQ+ people in the country and encourages hate speech, and could lead to further violent incidents,” he said.
Gogia pointed to the stabbing death of Abramidze, even though he believed it’s unlikely the developments are directly linked. A 26-year-old man was detained, and police opened an investigation on a charge of “premeditated murder committed with particular cruelty and aggravating circumstances on gender grounds.”
Abramidze was famous in Georgia as “a symbol of the freedom and fight and a very strong woman,” said Taki Mumladze, a director, actor and screenwriter.
Mumladze, who co-wrote and starred in a movie depicting a same-sex relationship and later directed a play about it, told AP the killing shocked Georgians, whatever side of the issue they were on.
Georgia was “very, very homophobic” at one point, she said, recalling anti-gay demonstrations two years ago on the day her movie premiered.
Such protests are common in the country. Last year, hundreds of opponents of gay rights stormed an LGBTQ+ festival in Tbilisi, forcing its cancellation, and tens of thousands marched in the capital this year to promote “traditional family values.”
But Mumladze said attitudes had begun to change in recent years, thanks to NGOs educating society and providing support for the LGBTQ+ community. She says her own conservative, religious parents saw her movie and play, and really liked both.
“So I felt very good. And now with this law … even my art will be forbidden,” she said. “It’s crazy that the government is trying to stop this progress.”
She and Jakeli are pinning their hopes on the upcoming election.
“We are mobilizing for the elections,” Jakeli said. “We are urging everybody to go and vote, go and vote for Georgia’s European future, which also includes human rights for all, including us.”
Added Mumladze: “I hope with the elections we will change this because if not, we will lose this country for a long, long time.”

5752,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-06-23,"Ukrainian officials announced the Stalker 5.0 drone boat during the Black Sea Security Forum (BSSF) held in the Ukrainian city of Odessa on June 14 to 16. It boasts a 60-horsepower speedboat engine that allows it to race at speeds of 46 miles per hour over the sea. Officials also touted the unmanned watercraft's operational range of 372 miles.
The Stalker drone boat can carry explosive payloads of up to 150 kilograms and also features a ""logistical mode."" But the drone boat isn't just for kamikaze missions as it can transport food, water, military equipment and medical supplies for remote areas.
It can also be utilized for coastal patrols and surveillance. A Starlink satellite internet terminal and high-definition cameras installed on the drone boat provide the operator with a real-time video stream.
According to Great Game India, the Stalker 5.0 drone boat signals Ukraine's strategy to challenge the dominance of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. It also pointed out that the drone boat, alongside Kyiv's rapid development of maritime drones, poses a significant threat to Russian maritime security.
Officials also told participants of the BSSF that the Kerch Bridge, which spans five meters long and 1.2 meters wide, can be targeted using this unmanned watercraft. The bridge connects the annexed Crimea region to mainland Russia, and has been a target of Ukrainian attacks.
Moreover, they also mentioned that the drone boat's logistical mode would prove very helpful to Ukrainian forces on the right bank of the Dnipro River. Resupplying Ukrainian marines with conventional boats as they try to retain the Krynky bridgehead has become more difficult, according to the Telegraph.

Ukrainian drone warfare on the Black Sea forced the Russian Navy to evacuate, but not without its finest warships being sunk in the process. The battleships were sunk by a combination of unmanned drones operated by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and the Main Directorate of Intelligence, the latter under the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense (MOU).
Great Game India cited two examples of Russian Navy warships that were sunk by Ukrainian drones. The Sergey Kotov warship, which entered service in 2022, was allegedly hit by an explosive kamikaze sea drone strike in March. It sunk close to the port town of Feodosia in Crimea.
Meanwhile, the missile ship Ivanovets was likewise sunk by Ukrainian sea drones. A video clip released by the MOU showed the ship under fire in Crimea.
But the SBU's experimental drone strike on the Kerch Bridge last July, which resulted in a massive explosion, nevertheless remains the most notable example of Ukrainian drone warfare. The security service used a Sea Baby drone equipped with up to 850 kg of explosives, approaching the bridge in the dark before smashing into it and launching flying debris into the air. Videos released by the SBU and other Ukrainian sources showed the extent of the attack, which caused a massive explosion.
But the Russians were quick to adapt following the drone attack. Russian coastal targets were surrounded by newly developed drone models, with some equipped with mobile Grad rocket launchers. The Kerch Bridge was also reinforced with atypical defenses, including layers of netting and floating booms, in the expectation that these measures might deter drone strikes in the future.

3533,fake,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-10-09,"In September, the Georgian Parliament voted 84-0 in favor of ""On Family Values and Protection of Minor,"" a bill that would protect society from the pseudo-liberal ideology and the inevitable harmful consequences of extreme LGBT ideology. The legislation would ban same-sex marriages and adoptions by same-sex couples, public displays and support of the LGBT rainbow flag and media depictions of LGBTQ+ relationships and individuals. It would also ban gender alteration procedures and prevent changes to gender designations on official documents.
The ruling Georgian Dream Party provided the necessary votes for its passage. However, the opposition party of Zourabichvili refused to sign the proceedings and returned it to the parliament on Oct. 3. (Related: Georgian MP introduces bill that seeks to ban LGBT propaganda and indoctrination efforts (most of which target youth.))
But the Georgian Dream and its allies in parliament had enough seats to override her opposition. The speaker had five days to sign and publish the law after the president refused. The law will take effect 60 days after publication, more than a month after the crucial Oct. 26 parliamentary elections.
""Today, according to the Constitution of Georgia, I am signing the law 'Protection of Family Values and Minors,' which was not signed by Salome Zurabishvili,"" Papuashvili posted on his official Facebook account on Oct. 4.
""The law, which I am signing, does not reflect current, temporary, changing ideas and ideologies, but is based on common sense, historical experience and centuries-old Christian, Georgian and European values.""
In his Facebook post, Papuashvili also criticized Zurabishvili for her refusal to sign the bill.
""Symbolic that the nominal leader of the homeless and worthless Opposition, who has become a lovable president, refuses to sign a law that protects what is most valuable to a person – family and children. This refusal clearly shows where Salome Zurabishvili stands and where are the anti-national oppositionists hiding behind her, who did not dare to openly express their opinion on this law and shamefully escaped from the hall while voting on the law,"" he wrote.
The speaker also claimed that the legislation reflects common sense and historical experience, despite anticipated criticism from the international community.
""I understand that signing this law will cause criticism from some foreign partners, but we Georgians have never been afraid of others' evaluations when it was our belief, common sense and loyalty to our country and when we saw that civilization currents were cutting the wrong trench. This has gotten us through millennia. This is how we preserve our identity. At the same time, in the same foreign country, we see the spirit of millions of people agreeing with this law,"" he said.
Similarly, Papuashvili stated in September that the collaboration between Georgia and the EU should not involve ""blindly"" following directives. Instead, he advocated for a ""two-way path"" characterized by ""mutual learning, mutual respect and mutual acceptance.""
""Georgia is one of the first cradles of European civilization. We are co-creators of the fact that agriculture, viticulture and the Christian faith were woven into the European identity,"" he said. ""Even today, our rapprochement with the European Union should not be a matter of blindly following instructions, but should be a two-way path – a path of mutual learning, mutual respect, mutual acceptance, [and] not merger and losing [identity].""

5818,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-06-25,"The 2024 wildfire season has already begun in Europe as the season starts earlier and lasts longer.
Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of the world’s most extreme wildfires, a new study shows.
Analysing 21 years of NASA satellite data, researchers found that severe burns more than doubled in frequency between 2003 and 2023. The intensity of these fires also increased 2.3-fold, with the six most extreme years happening from 2017 onwards.
In Europe, Portugal is among the countries worst affected in recent years.
Alongside the Amazon, Australia, Canada, Chile, Indonesia, Siberia and the western US, according to the study published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.
These ‘energetically extreme’ wildfires - measured by the energy released in a day - often destroy ecosystems, impact the health and livelihoods of local people, and cause billions of euros of damage. They also emit vast quantities of smoke and greenhouse gases, which in turn worsen global warming - one of the key drivers of wildfires.
Temperate conifer forests face rising wildfire risk
The researchers found that extreme wildfires were disproportionately concentrated in key habitats around the world.
In particular, the frequency of extreme events has increased by more than 11 times in temperate conifer forests, such as those found in the western US, in the last two decades. In boreal forests and taiga - found in North America and Russia - they have risen by more than seven times.
Low moisture in the twigs, leaves, grasses and other forest debris that fuels wildfires has sparked an “exponential increase” in the area burned in recent decades.
This is a result of human-caused climate change, and drove more than half of the increase in forest fire extent in the western US between 1979 and 2015, according to the study.
Europe’s wildfires are ramping up as summer sets in
Greece is bracing for a long wildfire season after unprecedented heat sparked an early start to blazes this month.
A fire in mid-June closed traffic along a main highway in Athens, requiring 70 firefighters and 13 planes and helicopters to keep it under control in strong winds.
The country doubled its firefighter capacity in May in anticipation of a record season.
The EU has also boosted efforts to reduce wildfire damage in Europe following a devastating summer in 2023. A team of 556 firefighters from 12 countries will be strategically placed across key locations, including in high risk areas like France, Greece, Portugal and Spain.
Why are wildfires so dangerous?
Besides their immediate threat to life, wildfires release fine particulate matter (PM2.5) that can cause and exacerbate lasting health conditions like lung and heart disease.
This can lead to premature death, sometimes months after the actual fire. This was tragically illustrated this week after Hawaii authorities announced the death of a 68-year-old woman from injuries and health issues almost a year after she was caught up in the deadliest US wildfire in over a century last August.
With climate change driving up temperatures and creating drier conditions, fire seasons are starting earlier and finishing later.
In turn, fires release planet-warming gases into the atmosphere, creating a dangerous feedback loop."
2493,real,INSTITUTIONAL_AND_MEDIA_DISTRUST_PUBLIC_INSTITUTIONS,2024-05-17,"EU bans 4 more Russian media outlets from broadcasting in the bloc, citing disinformation
BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union on Friday banned four more Russian media outlets from broadcasting in the 27-nation bloc for what it calls the spread of propaganda about the invasion of Ukraine and disinformation as the EU heads into parliamentary elections in three weeks.
The latest batch of broadcasters consists of Voice of Europe, RIA Novosti, Izvestia and Rossiyskaya Gazeta, which the EU claims are all under control of the Kremlin. It said in a statement that the four are in particular targeting “European political parties, especially during election periods.”
Belgium already last month opened an investigation into suspected Russian interference in June’s Europe-wide elections, saying its country’s intelligence service has confirmed the existence of a network trying to undermine support for Ukraine.
The Czech government has imposed sanctions on a number of people after a pro-Russian influence operation was uncovered there. They are alleged to have approached members of the European Parliament and offered them money to promote Russian propaganda.

It is one of many vaccine centres in 42 districts designated a priority across the vast central African nation of some 28 million people.
The jab will be offered free of charge, according to the government, and systematically to all children under six months old at the same time as other obligatory or recommended vaccinations.
The WHO, the UN children's agency UNICEF and the Gavi vaccine alliance said in November that the move was ""a historic step towards broader vaccination against one of the deadliest diseases for African children"".
Saving lives
More than 300,000 doses of RTS,S -- the first malaria vaccine recommended by the UN's WHO -- arrived in Yaounde in late November.
It took two months to organise Monday's launch.
Since 2019, more than two million children have been jabbed in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi in a pilot phase.
The drive resulted in substantial reductions in severe malaria illness and hospitalisations.
Cameroon is the first large-scale and systematic programme in the world, according to the WHO, the coordinator of the campaign which is largely financed by Gavi.
""In Cameroon, 30 percent of consultations are linked to malaria,"" Aurelia Nguyen, chief programme officer of the Gavi vaccine alliance, told AFP.
""Having a preventative tool like the vaccine will free up the health system and result in fewer hospitalisations and deaths.""
Burkina Faso, Liberia, Niger and Sierra Leone are set to follow with large-scale vaccination programmes.
Willis Akhwale, special adviser at End Malaria Council Kenya, said the rollout was a relief but not a ""silver bullet"".
""The efficacy, much as it is saving lives, is not 100 percent, but even at 40 percent it's saving lives and especially at the age bracket of two years old when you tend to get severe malaria,"" he told AFP.

2465,fake,INSTITUTIONAL_AND_MEDIA_DISTRUST_PUBLIC_INSTITUTIONS,2024-03-14,"The world’s first regulations for the AI Act and the rapidly evolving AI technology were adopted by members of the European Parliament yesterday the 13th of March. The regulation,which was agreed by member states following negotiations in December 2023, was finally endorsed by MEPs with 523 votes in favour, 46 against and 49 abstentions (Source). EU policymakers have lauded the approval of the Act, but critics have warned that the legislation represents a giveaway to corporate interests, with one EU policy analyst stating that the digital policies are being used as a “testbed for oppressive surveillance
representing a blatant attack on everyone’s fundamental rights” as most of us would now have expected anyway.
A “Risk Based Approach”
The regulations which are expected to take effect in May or June after some final formalities with various provisions entering into force over the next few years “applies a “risk-based approach” to AI products and services.” the Associated Press reported on Wednesday, they wrote: “The vast majority of AI systems are expected to be low risk, such as content recommendation systems or spam filters. Companies can choose to follow voluntary requirements and codes of conduct. High-risk uses of AI, such as in medical devices or critical infrastructure like water or electrical networks, face tougher requirements like using high-quality data and providing clear information to users.”
Some AI uses are banned because they’re deemed to pose an unacceptable risk, like social scoring systems that govern how people behave, some types of predictive policing, and emotion recognition systems in school and workplaces. Other banned uses include police scanning faces in public using AI-powered remote “biometric identification” systems, except for serious crimes like kidnapping or terrorism.
While some had praised the act for it’s “positive common sense guidelines and protections”, the Artificial Intelligence Act, has garnered many other critics.
Failure From a Human Rights Perspective
“It can’t be denied that this is a historic moment both in the EU and globally: a law to govern artificial intelligence has been agreed on by the EU, It is the first of its kind in the world. It’s a long-awaited, hard-fought-over and lengthy piece of legislation.” wrote Laura Lazaro Cabrera, counsel and director of Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT) Europe’s Equity and Data Program, on Wednesday,
“But for CDT Europe, it is a mixed bag when it comes to protecting human rights – one of its key aims, after all.” she argued and that the law “will become the benchmark for AI regulation globally in what has become a race against the clock as lawmakers grapple with a fast-moving development of a technology with far-reaching impacts on our basic human rights.”
The Act introduces important limitations on law enforcement’s use of AI, yet lawmakers failed to implement a total ban on the use of untargeted facial recognition by law enforcement and the CDT and other human rights advocates warned that such use would pose unacceptably high human rights risks, in particular for marginalised and at-risk communities, according to Lazaro Cabrera.
Threat to the Right to Protest
She adds “Serious risks to human rights when it comes to AI remain in the AI Act. For example, the law’s exemptions for facial recognition threaten to “swallow the rule” and allow for widespread facial scanning by law enforcement on the EU’s streets – a serious threat to, for example, the right to protest….”
“The Act also creates what could easily be an over-exploited exemption for national security. While the Act does ban use of emotion recognition technologies, that ban only applies to education and the workplace, leaving unanswered questions as to why the Act did not adopt a ban on the use of these technologies as the starting position.”
A Victory for Industry and Police
Daniel Leufer, a senior policy analyst at the Brussels office of advocacy group Access Now, called the bloc’s landmark AI legislation “a failure from a human rights perspective and a victory for industry and police.” and he warned that the legislation represents a giveaway to corporate interests and falls short in key areas,
“The new AI Act is littered with concessions to industry lobbying, exemptions for the most dangerous uses of AI by law enforcement and migration authorities, and prohibitions so full of loopholes that they don’t actually ban some of the most dangerous uses of AI.” according to Leufer.
Access Now notes in particular that the final version of the AI Act:
- Fails to properly ban some of the most dangerous uses of AI, including systems that enable biometric mass surveillance and predictive policing systems;
- Creates a glaring loophole via Article 6(3) for developers to exempt themselves from obligations for high-risk AI systems,;
- Exempts law enforcement and migration authorities from important public transparency requirements when they use high-risk AI, meaning they can continue deploying dangerous systems in secret;
- Further broadens the national security exemption beyond what is allowed for in the EU treaties, allowing governments to exempt themselves from obligations under the AI Act in order to pursue cases deemed relevant to national security;
- Creates a separate regime for people migrating, seeking refuge, and/or living undocumented, leaving with them far fewer rights than EU citizens and almost no access to remedy when these rights are violated.
EU is “Prioritising the Interests of Industry and Law Enforcement”says Amnesty International.
Amnesty International’s advocacy adviser on artificial intelligence, Mher Hakobyan said “Even though adopting the world’s first rules on the development and deployment of AI technologies is a milestone, it is disappointing that the E.U. and its 27 member states chose to prioritise the interest of industry and law enforcement agencies over protecting people and their human rights,”
Along with also expressing concerns about how the law will impact migrants, refugees, and asylum-seekers, Hakobyan highlighted that “it does not ban the reckless use and export of draconian AI technologies.”
“Poses Significant Risk to Persons With Disabilities…”
“Artificial intelligence can pose significant risks to persons with disabilities and other marginalised groups if it is not properly regulated. The AI Act addresses human rights, but not as comprehensively as we hoped for– we now call on the European Union to close this gap with future initiatives.”
Yannis Vardakastanis, president of the European Disability Forum, said in a statement that “the AI Act addresses human rights, but not as comprehensively as we hoped for—we now call on the European Union to close this gap with future initiatives.”
Protect Not Surveil
Access Now and Amnesty are part of the ProtectNotSurveil coalition, who released a joint statement warning that the AI Act “sets a dangerous precedent,” particularly with its exemptions for law enforcement, migration officials, and national security.
Other members of the coalition include EuroMed Rights, European Digital Rights, and Statewatch, whose executive director, Chris Jones, said in a statement “It has severe shortcomings from the point of view of fundamental rights and should not be treated as a golden standard for rights-based AI regulation.”
Legislation Should Prioritise People and their Rights
Campaigners hope policymakers worldwide now take lessons from this legislative process and for the campaigners the legislation should respect the people and prioritise their Human Rights.
Amnesty’s Hakobyan emphasized that “countries outside of the E.U. should learn from the bloc’s failure to adequately regulate AI technologies and must not succumb to pressures by the technology industry and law enforcement authorities whilst developing regulation. States should instead put in place robust and binding AI legislation which prioritises people and their rights.”
Lazaro Cabrera stressed that “there’s so much at stake in the implementation of the AI Act and so, as the dust settles, we all face the difficult task of unpacking a complex, lengthy, and unprecedented law. Close coordination with experts and civil society will be crucial to ensure that the act’s interpretation and application mean that it is effective and consistent with the act’s own articulated goals: protecting human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.”
European Center for Not-for-Profit Law’s Karolina Iwańska responded similarly: “Let’s be clear: It has severe shortcomings from the point of view of fundamental rights and should not be treated as a golden standard for rights-based AI regulation. Having said that, we will work on the strongest possible implementation.”
Access Now state that “Despite the AI Act’s profound shortcomings, Access Now will work with civil society partners to push for the strongest possible implementation of the AI Act and the few rights-protecting tools it includes, while continuing to monitor and call out AI-facilitated abuses.”

""I say to my staff and to all other people that the money you're chasing, for which reason you don't want to take that break? If you do exit today, it's not going to be paid to you in the cemetery in any case,"" she says.
Her warning is backed by worrying statistics about the state of people's mental health across Africa.
Figures from the World Health Organization (WHO) suggest that its Africa region has one of the world's highest suicide rates. In 2019, this was measured at 11.2 per 100,000 population, compared to the global average of 9 per 100,000.
The WHO African region male suicide rate is the highest of all WHO regions at 18 per 100,000 population — compared to the global average of 12.4 per 100,000.
Some 77% of suicides occurred in low- and middle-income countries, with suicide rates in Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Mozambique, Central African Republic, Botswana, Eritrea, Cameroon, and Ivory Coast particularly high.
Beyond the statistics, workplace mental health is largely overlooked, according to Patience Osekre, a psychotherapist in Accra, Ghana.
""For employees, their productivity is affected and it affects their well-being and impact on other aspects of the work,"" she told DW.
The WHO's World Mental Health Day 2024 — which focused on prioritizing mental health in the workplace — highlighted how poor working conditions and job-related stress can worsen existing mental health conditions.
The WHO emphasized the need for global action to protect and promote mental health in the workplace, ensuring that people with mental health conditions are treated fairly and do not face discrimination, stigma, or violations of their human dignity.
Workforce rarely operating at optimum level
Globally, an estimated 12 billion working daysare lost every year to depression and anxiety, at a cost of $1 trillion per year in lost productivity, according to the WHO.
""Global uncertainty, and insecurity is a huge thing, burnout and has become a common issue in the workplace,"" Osekre said. ""We're talking about your sense of judgment, your decision making, your choices, your lifestyle, all this obviously affect the way you function the way.""
Osekre added that since employees spend so much of their time in the work environment, their mental health there needs to be prioritized.
""We need to also be emotionally literate, understand how we are feeling and even having the vocabulary to be able to express how we're feeling,"" Osekre said.
She noted that line managers and supervisors can become ""fixated"" on increasing workloads on their best employees in the hopes of improving productivity.
""These are people who want to do their best for the organization because it matters to their self-pride,"" Koduwu said. ""And so they just keep going. We've had some of the finest talents exit this world and it's all because they couldn't take the break.""
Avenues for treatment lacking
Koduwu and Osekre agree that it would be helpful for businesses to look out for their employees, even in highly competitive job markets where each salary is highly prized.
""As HR, we need to plan the workforce properly,"" Koduwu said. ""We've created a culture where people feel obliged to take on more just to prove themselves. We're trained not to complain. We're trained just to say it's OK, give it to God, you're going to get better. ""
This includes allowing overworked employees to take time off to improve their mental health without the threat of losing their job. This, according to Osekre, will lead to better output from workers.
""The employee resumes with energy that would beat your mind, because this person has been able to sort out whatever challenges they were going through within that period,"" she told DW.

3456,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-05-14,"FBI, Homeland Security warn of possible threats to LGBTQ events, including Pride Month activities
WASHINGTON (AP) — Foreign terrorist organizations or their supporters might target LGBTQ-related events and venues as part of June’s Pride Month, federal agencies warned in a recent public announcement.
The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security issued the announcement May 10 to raise awareness of “foreign terrorist organizations (FTOS) or their supporters potential targeting of LGBTQIA+-related events and venues.”
“Foreign terrorist organizations or supporters may seek to exploit increased gatherings associated with the upcoming June 2024 Pride Month,” the agencies wrote.
The announcement did not specify any locations or indicate the agencies were tracking any specific threats. According to the release, foreign terrorist groups and supporters have in the past promoted anti-LGBTQ rhetoric and targeted related events.
The release noted that June 12 marks the eighth anniversary of the attack on the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida. That was the deadliest attack on the LGBTQ community in U.S. history, leaving 49 people dead and 53 people wounded as “Latin Night” was being celebrated at the club. Gunman Omar Mateen was killed by SWAT team members after a three-hour standoff. He had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State.
In June of last year, three alleged sympathizers of the Islamic State group were arrested in Vienna for attempting to attack a Pride event there, the release noted.
The release also noted possible signs to watch out for that might indicate a potential problem, such as violent threats made online or in the mail. Potential attackers might also try to take photos of security-related equipment or access points at events; attempt to get into restricted areas or impersonate law enforcement personnel; or chat up staff at various venues to get information like what types of events they have upcoming and what the crowd sizes might be.
Pride Month, held in June, is a particularly important time in the LGBTQ+ rights movement. After starting June 28, 1970, as New York City’s first Pride march, it has evolved into a nationwide event in which cities and towns across America hold marches both to call attention to specific issues such as same-sex marriage and to celebrate."
3864,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-09-17,"This preventive drug could be a 'game changer' in ending the HIV epidemic
Can we eliminate the HIV epidemic?
It’s a question that dates back to the start of the epidemic in the 1980s. With 1.3 million new infections a year, the epidemic continues … and the world is not on track to meet the ambitious U.N. goal of ending HIV/AIDS by 2030.
But now there’s rising optimism among leading infectious disease experts after the latest groundbreaking clinical trial results for a drug called lenacapavir which have shown it to be capable of virtually eliminating new HIV infections through sex.
PURPOSE 2, the name for the latest trial sponsored by Gilead Science, the California-based maker of lenacapavir, found the drug to be 96% effective in preventing HIV infections in the newly released results of a clinical trial of more than 3,200 cisgender men, transgender men, transgender women and gender non-binary individuals who have sex with partners assigned male at birth. The study was conducted across sites in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Peru, South Africa, Thailand and the United States.
These results follow equally dramatic findings from a previous lenacapavir trial called PURPOSE 1 which followed 5,300 cisgender women in South Africa and Uganda. In news which headlined July’s AIDS 2024 conference in Munich, early results indicated 100% efficacy, after Gilead Sciences revealed that not a single woman who had received the drug since the trial began in August 2021, had contracted HIV.
Ethel Weld, an assistant professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, described both sets of results as ‘a thrilling game changer for HIV prevention.’
In particular, lenacapavir which is administered via a twice-yearly injection, represents a dramatic new alternative to the current standard of care for HIV prevention: taking a pill called Truvada every day. While this type of drug, called pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), has also been shown to be 99% effective in blocking HIV infections from sex in clinical trials, this is not necessarily the case in the real world.
People don’t always take their pills. In a study in South Africa, women said they felt there was a stigma to the pill -- a sexual partner might assume they’re taking it because they already have HIV or because they have other partners. Research has also highlighted significant barriers in taking daily oral PrEP among men who have sex with men, ranging from access to the drug, inconvenience, and perceptions that it is unnecessary. One study showed oral PrEP effectiveness to be as low as 26% in certain populations -- men under age 30, for example.
Weld points out that in both the PURPOSE 1 and PURPOSE 2 trials, it was notable that the participants randomized to receive daily oral PrEP instead of lenacapavir, showed low adherence to the medication.
“The burden of taking daily medicine varies for each individual and may well be perceived as an even greater burden for healthy people who feel fine,” says Weld. “The finding that twice yearly injections have high efficacy in preventing HIV, lowers the amount that an individual has to do over the course of a lifetime to protect themselves. It puts lenacapavir much closer to the domain of other preventive paradigms such as vaccination.”
A potential 'game-changer'
Advocacy groups have also expressed great enthusiasm. “Lenacapavir would be “a real game-changer,” particularly for people facing stigma and discrimination in low- and middle-income countries,” read a statement by People’s Medicines Alliance -- a global coalition of more than 100 organizations that span 33 countries and that advocate for making medications more accessible.
Cécile Tremblay, a HIV researcher at the University of Montréal, highlighted the drug’s potential to tackle the epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa where the disease burden is greatest. Despite accounting for 10% of the world’s population, sub-Saharan Africans comprise two-thirds of people living with HIV -- 25.7 million out of 38.4 million. Every week, about 4,000 teen girls and young women in Africa are newly infected with HIV.
“Not only is lenacapavir extremely efficacious but the efficacy has been shown in a population of women in sub-Saharan Africa where the epidemic is the greatest, and oral PrEP has not performed as well due to stigma and discrimination,” says Tremblay.
Next steps
Lenacapavir is not a new drug. It’s been approved by the FDA in the United States for multi-drug resistant HIV treatment since 2022. But PURPOSE 1 and PURPOSE 2 are the first clinical trials to test it for HIV prevention.
According to Gilead Sciences, the data from the two trials will now be used to support a series of global regulatory filings which will begin by the end of 2024, with the aim of launching lenacapavir onto the market at some point in 2025.
Yet any eventual approval and widespread use would come with challenges. According to an analysis presented at the 24th International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2022), PrEP medications would need to cost less than $54 a year per patient for South Africa, for example, to be able to afford them. Lenacapavir’s cost as HIV treatment in the United States in 2023 was $42,250 per new patient per year. Oral PrEP options, on the other hand, can cost less than $4 a month.
Given the drug’s potential, Tremblay says that it is critical for access to be as widespread as possible. “The infrastructure needs to be in place to reach at-risk populations and make sure they can access it,” she says. “If everyone at risk could receive this prophylaxis, within a few years it could alter the course of the epidemic. When you substantially decrease the transmission rate, then the epidemic can wane down.”"

Analysts say Macron has taken the risky gamble of dissolving the national parliament in a bid to keep the far-right National Rally (RN) out of power when his second term ends in 2027.
""I am confident in the capacity of the French people to make the right choice for themselves and for future generations,"" Macron wrote on X on Monday.
Des élections législatives se tiendront le 30 juin et le 7 juillet.— Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) June 10, 2024
J’ai confiance en la capacité du peuple français à faire le choix le plus juste pour lui-même et pour les générations futures.
Ma seule ambition est d'être utile à notre pays que j'aime tant.
His announcement of elections for a new National Assembly on June 30, with a second round on July 7, has sparked widespread alarm, even from within the ranks of his party.
""By playing with fire, the head of state could end up by burning himself and dragging the entire country into the fire,"" Le Monde wrote in an editorial.
Despite the storm of criticism, Macron appeared unfazed on Monday as he visited the southwestern French village of Oradour-sur-Glane, site of a massacre by Nazi soldiers during World War II, together with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.
Steinmeier said: ""Let us never forget the damage done in Europe by nationalism and hate.""
A far-right premier?
Meanwhile, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, a Socialist, described the prospect of elections just weeks before the start of the Paris Olympics as ""extremely unsettling"".
But International Olympic Committee chief Thomas Bach played down any direct impact on the event.
Uncertainty around the election also sapped market confidence, with Paris's CAC 40 index closing 1.35 percent lower and the interest rate on French government debt gaining 10 basis points, to 3.22 percent.
In a televised address late Sunday, Macron warned of the danger of ""the rise of nationalists and demagogues"" for France and its place in Europe.
He noted that, including the RN, far-right parties in France had managed to take almost 40 percent of the EU Parliament vote.
Macron is hoping to win back the majority he lost in France's lower house in 2022 legislative elections after winning a second term.
But some fear the anti-immigration RN could instead win, forcing Macron to work in an uncomfortable coalition with a far-right prime minister.
RN co-leader Marine Le Pen said the party's fellow leader and her protege, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, would be its contender for prime minister.
Le Pen, who was runner-up in the last two presidential elections, is largely expected to tilt for the top job again in 2027.
However, it will not be plain sailing for the RN as the party still provokes widespread hostility.
Demonstrators took to the streets of Paris, Marseille, Rennes, Lyon and several other large cities on Monday evening to show their opposition to the far right.
Five labour unions also called for mass protests this weekend, warning that ""our republic and our democracy are in danger"" if the far right wins again at the end of the month.
'Admiration for Putin'
The RN came in first in the French EU parliament voting with more than 31 percent, a score more than double that of Macron's list with 14 percent.
The Socialists and hard-left France Unbowed trailed behind with 13 and nine percent each.
The Socialists and three other left-wing parties -- France Unbowed, the Communists and the Ecologists -- announced late Monday that they would unite for the legislative elections as part of a ""popular front... to fight the far-right's racist project"".
On the far right, Marion Marechal, deputy head of the Reconquest party founded by pundit Eric Zemmour and seen as even further to the right of the RN, was meeting Marine Le Pen -- who is her aunt -- and Bardella at the RN headquarters.
Bardella said he had also ""stretched out his hand"" to the mainstream conservative Republicans party and had spoken with senior members.
Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group, said Macron appeared to believe he could defy the polls by confronting France with a choice between the pro-European status quo and a far right that has ""a history of admiration for -- and funding by -- Vladimir Putin"".
The RN appears to be going into the snap parliament voting from a position of force, garnering 33-34 percent of voter intentions according to separate polls by Harris Interactive-Toluna and Opinionway published Monday -- more than 15 points above its score in the 2022 legislative election.
That would place them well ahead of any united left-wing grouping (22 percent) and Macron's centrist camp (19 percent), according to the Harris Interactive-Toluna poll.

2796,fake,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-01-09,"The climate fanatics at The Washington Post treated an old oxymoronic article claiming that man-made global warming causing more Alaska blizzards as front-page news.
The Post took its Dec. 16, 2023, eco-propaganda headlined, “As Alaska’s climate gets wetter, snowstorms put the homeless in peril,” and plastered it onto the front page of the Jan. 8 print edition of the newspaper. Yes, you read that right. The newspaper effectively just broke old news. Apparently, regurgitating weeks-old agitprop was more important to the newspaper than the recent disturbing news that Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin hid his hospitalization for days without DOD officials or President Joe Biden knowing about it. Instead, The Post pushed the controversy to page A3 of The Post’s print edition. Talk about NOT getting one’s priorities straight.
The Alaska piece doom-mongered over the “recent onslaught of extreme precipitation,” which so-called climate scientists reportedly “predict will worsen as the atmosphere warms.” Strikingly, the leftist media writ large can’t get their stories straight and are trying to have their cake and eat it too. Reuters, for example, published another story around the same time as The Post’s article claiming “global warming” led to no snow in Canada. Huh? So either global warming either causes too much snow or no snow at all. Which one is it? Even The New York Times recently published an op-ed by contributing Opinion writer Elizabeth Spiers predicting “The End of Snow” because of climate change.
As JunkScience.com founder Steve Milloy told MRC Business, any problem, natural phenomenon or societal ill can somehow be blamed on climate change if climate activists butcher common sense hard enough. “The global warming narrative has been set up so that all problems – whether environmental, social and/or geopolitical – can be blamed on fossil fuel use. This is not science. Just politics,” Milloy rebuked. “So global warming is now about fretting cold weather and snow in Alaska?”
Two-faced, say-anything global warming propaganda:— Steve Milloy (@JunkScience) December 23, 2023
1. Global warming caused snow in Alaska. https://t.co/WMYoCV5vFD
2. Global warming caused no snow in Canada. https://t.co/aWSt378z7Q
Reality: Emissions have no effect on weather or climate. pic.twitter.com/FNdJ64ICRm
This appears to be the case for The Post, which infused an anti-human screed into its oxymoronic reporting: “Over the past 70 years, Anchorage has warmed 4.2 degrees Fahrenheit, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration temperature data taken from the airport, driven by humans burning fossil fuels.”
Climate Depot Marc Morano also ripped The Post for publishing what he described as “parody.” “Too little snow? Global warming. Too much snow? Global warming. There's no way to falsify the global warming hypothesis,” Morano told MRC Business. In his view, “It's very hard to keep track of these contradictory claims. Global warming was supposed to mean 'the end of snow,’ but now all of a sudden global warming somehow means the homeless suffer from record snow."" Morano pointed the MRC to a ridiculous 2000 Independent article claiming that “Snowfalls are now just a thing of the past” due to global warming as an example of climate change-obsessed media constantly moving goalposts.
Of course, nowhere did The Post mention the existence of the current El Niño phenomenon as an explanation for Alaska’s current weather conditions. As the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported on Aug. 16, 2023, “El Niño may result in less of the 40- to 50- below zero cold spells known all too well for people living in the [Alaska] Interior.” In essence, “That means snow could become heavier, putting strain on the roofs of houses.”
The term “El Niño” doesn’t appear once in The Post’s 1,903-word piece, even as it bemoaned the “[t]he heavy, wet snow” that “fell like a thick blanket on the homeless encampment near Davis Park in a patch of woods off Mountain View Drive.” But the “heavy, wet snow” was already predicted earlier as a probable side effect of El Niño. The newspaper, in effect, exploited the plight of the affected homeless population to bang out climate change propaganda about humans burning fossil fuels.
The Post managed to describe the effects of El Niño without mentioning it directly. “The storm had originated in a part of the Pacific Ocean south of the Aleutian Islands where surface temperatures have been anomalously warm for this time of year. With warmer temperatures, more moisture is available for storms.” The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration itself predicted this would happen in October 2023 as a result of El Niño: “From December through February, NOAA predicts wetter-than-average conditions for northern Alaska.” But the phenomenon wasn’t even worth a footnote in The Post’s long-form climate babble.
The Post seems to be operating by the principle “Never let a good crisis go to waste” to push its ridiculous eco-agitprop.
Conservatives are under attack. Contact The Washington Post at 202-334-6000 and tell it to stop regurgitating old eco-agitprop as front page news."
5314,real,ANTI_MIGRATION_AND_XENOPHOBIA,2024-10-07,"The number of migrants crossing into the U.S. illegally at the southern border reached the lowest point of President Biden's administration in September, three months into his crackdown on asylum claims, according to internal Department of Homeland Security statistics obtained by CBS News.
In September, U.S. Border Patrol agents recorded nearly 54,000 apprehensions of migrants who crossed into the country between legal entry points along the border with Mexico, the government figures show. It's a smaller figure than the previous Biden-era low in July, when Border Patrol processed roughly 56,000 migrants who crossed the border without authorization.
Border Patrol's tally of migrant apprehensions in September is the lowest number recorded by the agency since August 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic and the travel restrictions countries enacted in response to it led to a sharp decrease in migration to the U.S. southern border. It's also a 78% drop from a record high in December, when illegal border crossings soared to 250,000.
U.S. immigration officials processed another 48,000 migrants in September at legal border entry points, known as ports of entry, according to the internal federal data. Most of them secured appointments to enter the U.S. via a phone app the Biden administration has transformed into the main gateway into the American asylum system.
September's numbers show migration to the U.S.-Mexico border has plateaued following a precipitous drop at the start of the summer, when President Biden invoked sweeping presidential powers to disqualify most of those entering the country illegally from asylum. In July, August and September, Border Patrol agents at the southern border recorded between 54,000 and 58,000 migrant apprehensions each month.
Designed to be temporary, Mr. Biden's move to sharply restrict asylum is likely to remain in place indefinitely after his administration made the policy's deactivation threshold harder to meet last week. Vice President Kamala Harris has also vowed to continue the strict measure if elected president and make it even more difficult to lift.
The Biden administration's support for drastic limits on asylum reflect a broader rightward shift on border policy by Democrats that would have been unthinkable in 2020, when the party faced pressure to reverse the Trump administration's hardline immigration rules. It's a shift that has occurred amid a marked increase in support for tough immigration measures among the American public.
The dramatic reduction in illegal border crossings this year, however, has given Democrats a much-needed political win on immigration ahead of the presidential election next month. Former President Donald Trump, who is pledging to carry out mass deportations if voters return him to the White House, has sought to make immigration a defining issue of the 2024 race for the president.
With September's tally, fiscal year 2024 saw the lowest level in unlawful border crossings under the Biden administration. Border Patrol recorded over 1.5 million migrant apprehensions in fiscal year 2024, compared to a record high of 2.2 million in fiscal year 2022.
While the Mexican government's efforts to interdict those trekking north have also played a major role in the lower number of migrant arrivals along the U.S. border this year, American officials have credited Mr. Biden's stringent asylum rules in June for the current four-year low in illegal immigration levels.
During its first three years in office, the Biden administration struggled to respond to an unprecedented migrant influx that was, in great part, fueled by arrivals from far-flung countries, including nations like Venezuela where the U.S. cannot deport migrants on a regular basis due to frosty diplomatic relations. In many cases, migrants were released into the U.S. with notices to appear in immigration court simply because the government did not have the resources and personnel to vet their asylum claims at the border.
But since Mr. Biden's partial ban on asylum claims took effect, there has been an 80% drop in migrant releases, a senior Customs and Border Protection official told CBS News, requesting anonymity to speak candidly about migration trends. The U.S. government has long viewed migrant releases as a ""pull"" factor that fuels migration to the southern border, alongside economic conditions and other ""push"" factors in migrants' home countries.
More than 70% of migrant adults and families apprehended by Border Patrol have been deported from the U.S. since Mr. Biden's asylum crackdown began, up from 25% in May, according to DHS data. Since the policy took effect, the U.S. has carried out over 121,000 returns and deportations of migrants.
The asylum restrictions do not apply to unaccompanied children or those with acute medical conditions. It also exempts more than 1,000 migrants who enter the U.S. at legal border entry points each day under the phone app-powered appointment system. The Biden administration has paired that process and other legal migration channels, including a program that allows migrants from four countries to fly to the U.S. if they have American sponsors, with its asylum restrictions to deter unlawful crossings through a carrots-and-sticks strategy.
While it has arguably been responsible for ending, at least temporarily, large-scale illegal crossings and chaotic images at the U.S.-Mexico border, the Biden administration's asylum crackdown has been derided as an election gimmick by Republican lawmakers and a draconian policy by migrant advocates, who are challenging the policy in court.
In a conference hosted by the Migration Policy Institute last week, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas challenged those critical of the asylum restrictions to find an ""alternative proposal,"" calling the situation at the border before the policy change ""unworkable.""
""We have to understand the fact that the American public does want, does expect and does demand the delivery of order,"" Mayorkas said, adding later, ""And I would respectfully submit that, at least in particular times over the past three years, we haven't had order."""
3689,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-07-09,"New report critiques UK transgender youth care research study
The UK's NHS Cass Review has been cited in restrictive trans care policies.
Editors note: This story previously stated the new report as a Yale study. The study was performed in part by Yale researchers and is not affiliated with the institution.
A new report released by researchers from the Yale Law School, Yale School of Medicine, Oregon Health & Science University, Northwestern University and others criticizes the often-cited Cass Review on gender-affirming care for transgender youth, commissioned by the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom.
The review, released in April, was performed by Dr. Hillary Cass, a former president of the Royal College of Pediatrics and Child Health, amid a rise in referrals to NHS' gender services. Her review – which calls for more research, more support, and more caution around gender-affirming care – has been cited in the NHS decision to restrict the prescribing of puberty-pausing medications, also known as puberty blockers, to children and young people under 18 years old in the U.K.
In the U.S., gender-affirming care remains a hot-button issue in the political and medical arenas. At least 25 states have enacted restrictions on care for transgender youth since 2022, according to the Human Rights Campaign.
The Cass review was cited in recent, successful legislative efforts in Indiana to uphold a 2023 law that prohibited physicians from providing ""gender transition procedures"" to anyone younger than 18 years old, with certain medical exceptions.
The new report – which states it was authored by a team of researchers and clinicians that has ""86 years of experience working with 4,800 transgender youth,"" and ""has published 278 peer-reviewed studies, 168 of which are related to gender-affirming care"" – takes issue with several aspects of the Cass Review in their critique, saying that it ""obscures key findings, misrepresents its own data, and is rife with misapplications of the scientific method."" It also accuses the Review of speculating about data on transgender patients, and criticizes certain statements made in the Review about concern over gender care referrals, early medical intervention, and more.
Yet despite being cited in the NHS decision to restrict prescribing puberty blockers to minors, the report notes that the Cass Review does not recommend a ban on trans youth care. It also notes that it consistently makes recommendations that are in line with international gender-affirming medical care guidelines by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) and the Endocrine Society, a professional medical organization that is ""dedicated to providing the field of endocrinology with timely, evidence-based recommendations for clinical care and practice,"" according to its website.
In response to an ABC News request for comment, the team that authored the Cass Review said in a statement that the research that ""underpins"" the Review's findings ""looked at 237 papers from 18 countries, providing information on a total of 113,269 children and adolescents,"" and was subject to peer review.
""In making her recommendations, Dr. Cass had to rely on the currently available evidence and think about how the NHS can respond safely, effectively, and compassionately,"" the Review team told ABC News.
The statement continued, ""The body of research on gender care for children and young people was strikingly poor compared to other areas of child and adolescent healthcare where life changing interventions are given, meaning there is not a reliable evidence base upon which to make clinical decisions, or for children and their families to make informed choices.""
Spike in gender service referrals
The Cass Review repeatedly claims that the increase of referrals for gender-affirming care in the U.K. was ""exponential,"" and that social acceptance of transgender identities is unlikely to be the sole explanation for the rise.
""While it certainly seems to be the case that there is much greater acceptance of trans identities, particularly among younger generations, which may account for some of the increase in numbers, the exponential change in referrals over a particularly short five-year timeframe is very much faster than would be expected for normal evolution of acceptance of a minority group,"" Cass states.
In the new report, researchers counter that the increase in referrals to the U.K.'s Gender Identity Service is not exponential, and points to Cass's own data on referrals, which they say actually shows the number of referrals plateaued, and then decreased starting in 2017. A graph included in the Cass Review that shows a spike from 2021 to 2022 in child and adolescent referrals for gender dysphoria is accompanied by a note that states there is ""a strong possibility that there was double counting"" of referrals during the time period.
""While there certainly is an increase in referrals, describing this increase as 'exponential' is a serious error that fuels concern that the Review is too often more interested in subjective polemics than in scientific accuracy,"" the Yale report says.
Research quality on gender-affirming care
The Cass Review also criticized the evidence supporting the need for gender-affirming care. It concluded that ""while a considerable amount of research has been published in this field, systematic evidence reviews demonstrated the poor quality of the published studies, meaning there is not a reliable evidence base upon which to make clinical decisions, or for children and their families to make informed choices.""
The collective of experts counter in their report that the Cass Review's ""recommendations are informed by a flawed concept of evidence."" It says the Review ""fails to recognize the nuances of evidence quality measures""; that it ""does not follow established standards for evaluating evidence and evidence quality""; that it ""casually discusses evidence quality and does not define it, contravening standard practice in scientific evaluations of medical research""; and that it ""fails to contextualize the evidence for gender-affirming care with the evidence base for other areas of pediatric medicine.""
""If high-quality evidence were a prerequisite for medical care, we would all be worse off,"" the Yale report further states. ""Moderate, low, and very low-quality evidence,"" as defined by what the report says is ""one of the most widely accepted frameworks for determining evidence quality,"" and ""informs necessary, high-value care at every stage of life.""
The Cass Review team states in an online FAQ that ""the approach to the assessment of study quality was the same as would be applied to other areas of clinical practice – the bar was not set higher for this Review.""
A subsequent clarification in the FAQ further states: ""The same level of rigor should be expected when looking at the best treatment approaches for this population as for any other population so as not to perpetuate the disadvantaged position this group have been placed in when looking for information on treatment options.""
Early intervention concerns
The new report also takes issue with what it calls ""unfounded speculation"" in the Cass Review that ""social transition and puberty-pausing medications may cause harm by putting youth onto a medical path."" It further notes instances in which they assert the Cass Review ""expresses concern that early supportive interventions, such as social transition and puberty-pausing medications, lock young people into irreversible care.""
For example, while stating that for some young patients, the ""best outcome"" will be gender transitioning, the Review also argues that ""those who had socially transitioned at an earlier age and/or prior to being seen in clinic were more likely to proceed to a medical pathway,"" and that ""the vast majority of people started on puberty blockers proceed from puberty blockers to masculinizing/feminizing hormones"" – an ""altered trajectory, culminating in medical intervention which will have life-long implications.""
The Cass Review also cautions that young people who transition before they experience life as the gender with which they do not identify ""may have no frame of reference to cause them to regret or detransition, but at the same time they may have had a different outcome without medical intervention and would not have needed to take life-long hormones.""
""It is completely unscientific and inappropriate to expect a young person, regardless of their gender identity, to 'try out' life as a gender they do not identify with – as the Review supposes transgender youth should,"" the Yale report states. It further says that ""The Review's own data show that most referred patients are never subsequently referred to pediatric endocrinology and even fewer receive medical interventions.""
The report argues that continuing care isn't necessarily cause for alarm or concern, and that ""The Review does not consider the most likely explanation for why most youth who receive early, supportive interventions continue onto gender-affirming hormone therapy: that they are indeed transgender.""
""It is not social transition and puberty-pausing medications that drive a persistent transgender identity,"" the Yale report asserts. ""It is a transgender identity that drives social transition and subsequent medical interventions.""
Detransitioning and regret
The Cass Review asserts that ""the percentage of people treated with hormones who subsequently detransition remains unknown due to the lack of long-term follow-up studies, although there is suggestion that numbers are increasing.""
However, in the Review's audit of 3,306 patients who were discharged from the U.K. Gender Identity Service (GIDS), fewer than 10 patients transitioned back to their birth-registered gender – which the collective of researchers note is ""a 'detransition' date of 0.3%.""
The new report also states that it is ""exceedingly rare that an individual would later determine that they are not transgender"" after receiving clinical transgender care and support. ""A person who regrets receiving care may continue to identify as transgender; another who stops medications may not experience regret, and one who stops identifying as transgender may not regret receiving medical care,"" the report says.
A report in JAMA Pediatrics noted by the new report found that 1% of youth who received gender-affirming medications in the study re-identified with their assigned sex at birth.
In another study noted in the report, this one in the LGBT Health journal, 82.5% of those surveyed ""reported familial pressure, social pressure, employment difficulty, inability to access care, and financial reasons"" as the reason they presented themselves as their sex assigned at birth."
5990,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-03-29,"As Catalonia's water restrictions hit farmers the hardest, the tourism industry’s efforts to save itself could cause friction.
Standing in a field of apple trees in Catalonia, fruit and cereal farmer Ramón Falguera looks worried.
Last year, fruit harvests dropped by around a third and wheat by half due to a lack of rain and restrictions on water use in this area of northeast Spain.
The water canal used for irrigating the farmland, which stems from rivers born in the Pyrenees mountains, only opened for a month last spring for the first time since it was built 160 years ago.
The drought is thought to be the worst in 200 years, hitting large swathes of the region following more than three years of low rainfall and record temperatures due to climate change.
With no end in sight, farmers like Falguera are concerned that the water they rely on for irrigation will be cut off again.
How are farmers impacted by Spain’s water restrictions?
In early February, when reservoir levels in parts of the region dropped to below 16 per cent, the government declared a state of emergency in many areas of Catalonia.
Pere Aragonès, head of the regional government, announced restrictions across several different sectors. The amount of water that the agricultural sector - the biggest consumer of water - could use to irrigate crops was cut by up to 80 per cent.
For Falguera, a lack of rainfall and local water restrictions will likely mean two irrigations this year instead of the usual eight.
The situation was already critical for irrigation farmers in parts of Catalonia, according to David Saurí, geographer at the Universitat Autónoma de Barcelona and an expert in water management.
In some parts of the region it is the third year many farmers are unable to sufficiently irrigate their crops. This has had knock on effects for entire communities. Saurí calls it “a catastrophe.”
In March, Aragonés relaxed some of the measures originally imposed on the agriculture and cattle industries following pressure from these sectors.
‘Bad guys’ and ‘good guys’ of water use
While the agricultural industry is only responsible for 3 per cent of the region’s economy, many argue it should be seen as an essential industry. Instead, farmers in many parts of the region “feel badly treated” due to the lack of water, says Saurí, “while other economic sectors don’t have these problems.”
This includes the tourism industry. Though the sector is prohibited from filling swimming pools with freshwater in hotels and campsites in many areas, Aragonès rejected calls to enforce further restrictions on the sector, such as prohibiting cruise ships from docking in Barcelona’s harbour.
On 20 March, 40 activists reportedly cut off water to the Barcelona Tourism office, calling for more extreme restrictions on the sector.
According to Saurí, the average tourist in Barcelona is estimated to consume at least 60 per cent more water compared to the typical resident. But he is quick to acknowledge that tourism is not a monolith.
“Tourism is not what we would call the ‘bad guy’ of the movie … but there are lots of ‘bad guys’ and lots of ‘good guys.’ Not all tourism is the same,” says Saurí, explaining that people consume relatively little water in campsites compared to those staying in high-end hotels.
He added that in agriculture and cattle farming there are also big interests and businesses.
Tourism sector bets on desalination
The tourism industry has already been implementing water-saving methods for several years to reduce their bills, according to Saurí. These include more efficient showers and toilets.
But in one of Catalonia’s coastal tourist destinations, Lloret de Mar, the local hospitality association is now going a step further.
Due to the current restrictions, Lloret’s hotels have bought a mobile desalination machine for a reported €1.5 million to serve around 200 hotels.
“Once we’ve removed the salt [from the seawater] we’ll fill the swimming pools of the hotels,” says Enric Dotras, president of the association. Currently, the machine can generate 50 cubic metres of water per hour, but he adds that this will be increased in the future if needed. He claims that it will generate sufficient amounts of water.
“We are a tourist destination … where normally tourists enjoy the installations [in the hotels],” he says. “We have to keep this in mind if we want to maintain these businesses, and the indirect and direct jobs that come with them.”
Why are desalination plants controversial?
Tourism represents more than 20 per cent of Catalonia’s local economy.
In January alone, one million tourists stayed in hotels in Catalonia, and over 22,000 people were working in hotels. This normally rises dramatically in the summer months, raising concerns about the increased strain on water resources.
According to Saurí, if it doesn’t rain this summer, tourism in the region will suffer. But he cautions that the private use of a desalination plant by the tourism industry could cause frustration from other sectors that do not have the economic ability to pay for a plant.
“[Farmers] are told not to irrigate because there’s a drought, and they are seeing a campsite or a hotel nearby … that has a full swimming pool,” he says.
Greenpeace has also raised alarm about the environmental impact of desalination plants.
A recent Accenture report found that the plants increase energy use up to 23 times more than conventional water sources. It noted the substantial risks to marine life caused by the disposal of brine, the residue left after desalination.
“It can kill all the marine flora,” says Saurí, adding that it has to be managed really well.
What are the alternatives for Spanish water?
Despite these environmental risks, many in the agricultural industry also see desalination as one of the few ways to provide enough water to ensure industries can stay afloat.
The Catalan government last year announced it would invest almost €500 million from EU funds in desalination plants, yet it will take years to see any positive effect.
Many believe that water systems across the region should also be updated. According to the region’s water management agency, the Agència Catalana de l'Aigua, in 2022 Catalonia lost a quarter of its water due to leaks.
Pol Dunyó Ruhí, an organic smallholder farmer in the Barcelona province, says that water reuse and other alternatives should be launched to improve water management.
“I think the restrictions are absurd, and really unequal,” he says, but he adds that some farmers are using wasteful irrigation techniques when they could use more efficient methods.
“I don’t know if it’s because the farmers refuse, or because there is no support for installations of this kind … but it’s nonsense,” he says.
He also notes that restrictions should be applied with an ecological approach, highlighting how farmers cultivating vast fields of corn - a high water use crop produced to feed industrial chickens and pigs - are not treated any differently to those that use water more prudently.
For Falguera, more modern irrigation systems are also an essential way to lessen water consumption. This includes drip irrigation: delivering water directly to plants via a network of tubes or pipes.
“With modernised irrigation systems, we would be able to manage really well with the water that we have this year,” he says. Four irrigations would be sufficient for a fruit tree watered using a modernised irrigation system, he adds. “Water wouldn’t get wasted.”
Saurí notes that it's important to ensure farmers don’t have to stop cultivating. “If it doesn’t rain this summer, I honestly don’t know what will happen,” he says."
6434,real,GENDER_BASED_DISINFORMATION,2024-11-14,"Patients are stockpiling birth control over fears Trump could limit access to contraception
Trump walked back comments on restricting contraceptives on the campaign trail.
Women are stocking up on birth control and asking for long-term contraception methods following President Donald Trump being elected to a second term last week, doctors say.
Searches for ""birth control"" and ""Plan B"" doubled between Nov. 2 and the two days after the election, with a notable spike the day after the election, Google Search data shows.
Doctors told ABC News that patients are worried that access to birth control and contraception might be limited after Trump takes office due to efforts made during his first term and comments made on the campaign trail.
Dr. Brittany Cline, an OB-GYN at Northwestern Medicine, in Chicago, said she has seen an increase in the number of appointments being made for contraceptive or birth control counseling as well as appointments for long-acting contraceptives being either inserted or replaced or exchanged.
""We have, in clinic, seen many patients coming in for their [intrauterine device] replacements, even this week,"" she told ABC News. ""On Monday, I used all of our intrauterine devices that the clinic had, and I think that this is going to continue over the next few months and even years down the line, as people try to take some control over their bodies.""
Cline said she also received a message from a patient this week requesting four years of her birth control prescription be sent to a pharmacy.
'That's something that I have not, you know, seen before. Usually, we supply, you know, 12 months, one year at a time,"" she said. ""We do know that as many medications, there is a shelf life, and so it would not be safe for me to prescribe four years' worth of contraception to a patient because of the shelf life.""
Dr. Leslie Kantor, professor and chair of the Department of Urban Global Public Health at the Rutgers School of Public Health, in New Jersey, told ABC News that she has heard anecdotal reports of more traffic to websites that have information about birth control.
She said patients may be worried because of the federal contraceptive coverage guarantee. Under a provision of the Affordable Care Act, most private insurance plans must cover the full cost of most contraceptives, such as birth control, without making patients pay out-of-pocket costs.
If the incoming Trump administration allows employers and schools to use religious and moral exemptions to prevent coverage of contraceptives, as the White House did during Trump's first term, this may lead to out-of-pocket costs that make contraceptives unaffordable to some, experts previously told ABC News.
The experts say patients may be concerned due to comments Trump made on the campaign trail suggesting he's open to restricting contraceptives.
During an interview with Pittsburgh TV station KDKA-TV, Trump was asked if he supports any restrictions on a person's right to contraceptives.
""Well, we're looking at that and we're going to have a policy on that very shortly,"" Trump responded. ""And I think it's something you'll find interesting and it's another issue that's very interesting.""
When asked to clarify if he was suggesting he was open to supporting some restrictions on contraceptives, ""like the morning-after pill,"" Trump dodged, saying. ""Things really do have a lot to do with the states -- and some states are going to have different policy than others.""
Some states have also taken it upon themselves to provide contraception access. In Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer launched Take Control of Your Birth Control, a program to provide Michigan families access to free contraception including over-the-counter oral birth control pills, emergency contraception, condoms and family planning.
Both Cline and Kantor recommended that patients speak to their health care providers about the best birth control method for them as well as what options are available for them down the road.
""The advice that I would give to people right now is this is a great time to figure out the best birth control method for you, and you can do that in a variety of ways,"" Kantor said. ""It's a terrific time to find an ongoing method of birth control that will work. …There's no reason, however, to panic. Access to birth control is not going away tomorrow, and in fact, it's not going away on the day that Trump becomes president.""

2433,real,INSTITUTIONAL_AND_MEDIA_DISTRUST_PUBLIC_INSTITUTIONS,2024-06-06,"In a possible harbinger of strong electoral gains for the hard right in the Europe Union, the exit poll indicated that Wilders’ Party for Freedom had made the biggest gains — winning seven seats, up from just one in the last parliament.
The poll of some 20,000 voters published by national broadcaster NOS predicted the center-left alliance would win eight of 31 European Parliament seats up for grabs in the Netherlands.
Wilders was jubilant.
“The biggest winner,” he said on X, formerly Twitter. “And super tense because in Sunday’s final result we can still become the biggest.”
Read more2024 European Election Projections and Results
Having sent shockwaves around Europe six months ago by becoming the biggest party in the Dutch national parliament, Wilders now wants to build on that popularity and set the tone for much of the bloc, with calls to claw power back to national capitals and away from the EU so that member states have more autonomy on issues such as migration.
Final results for the entire EU will be announced in Brussels after polls close Sunday night. The Netherlands is electing 31 of the 720 members of the European Parliament to five-year terms.
Paradoxically, like many hard-right parties across the bloc, Wilders wants to get more power in the European Parliament, so he can weaken the EU institutions from within.
“You also need to have a strong presence in the European Parliament and make sure that, if necessary, we will be able to change the European guidelines in order to be in charge of our own immigration policy and asylum policy,” Wilders said after voting in The Hague.
That is why he was immediately calling for a broad alliance of hard right parties to break up the traditional coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, pro-business Liberals and Greens.
“Making a larger group in the European Parliament,” Wilders said, ”that gives us power to change all those European regulations in order to be more in charge of it ourselves — here in the national parliaments.”
Wilders, Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and French opposition leader Marine Le Pen stand in stark contrast to much of the left and many center parties, which call for a more united European approach on anything from climate change measures to defense, arguing individual nations only have a weak voice on the global stage.
“It is important that the European Union is a good and strong partner,” said Gerard Kroon, a 66-year-old who works for the Hague municipality and voted in city hall for pro-Europe party Volt. “We have to get things done all together. Not only in Europe but in the Netherlands too.”
Populist parties rising
Since the last EU election in 2019, populist, far-right and extremist parties now lead governments in three EU nations, are part of governing coalitions in several others, and appear to have surging public support across the continent.
The Dutch center-right Christian Democratic Appeal party reported that its website was “temporarily less accessible” because of a distributed denial of service attack Thursday.
“On election day, we consider this an attack on free, democratic elections,” the party posted on X.
National broadcaster NOS reported that the site of Wilders’ party and the far right Forum for Democracy also were briefly down.
The EU elections are the world’s second-biggest exercise in democracy behind the election in India, and the stakes are high.
Almost 400 million voters will be electing 720 members of the European Parliament from beyond the Arctic circle to the edges of Africa and Asia. The results will have an impact on issues ranging from global climate policies and defense to migration and geopolitical relations with China and the United States.
There was some early voting in some countries, but the Netherlands is the only EU country to start its single-day vote so early, followed by Ireland and the Czech Republic on Friday and the rest of the EU nations over the weekend. Europe-wide results will be announced Sunday night after all member states have completed voting.
Since the last European elections in 2019, war has broken out on the fringe of the bloc following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a country that desperately wants to join the EU.
Dissatisfaction with the EU
A founding member, the Netherlands was long unwavering in its support of EU policies. Research from the Clingendael think tank, though, suggests dissatisfaction with the EU among Dutch people, and that while most believe that the Netherlands should remain in the bloc, many also believe it should be more self-sufficient.
While many voters are predicted to lurch to the right, the Christian Democrat-dominated European People’s Party, led by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, is currently the EU legislature’s biggest bloc and is bound to be the coalition kingmaker when the dust settles on the election results.
In the Netherlands, Wilders’ PVV could build on its domestic success and surge, possibly overtaking the combined Labor Party and Green Left. Labor topped the Dutch EU Parliament election in 2019 with 19% of the vote for six seats while the Greens took 11% and three seats. Wilders’ party at the time only managed 3.5% and no seats.
Wilders and one of his likely coalition partners, the Farmer Citizen Movement, are popular among farmers in the Netherlands who have staged regular protests to call for an easing of EU legislation they say is crippling their livelihoods.
Wilders has in the past called for the Netherlands to leave the EU as Britain did, but his party’s manifesto for the election starting Thursday makes no mention of a so-called Nexit. Instead, it urges voters to back the PVV so it can change the EU from within, similar to plans of many other hard right parties across the bloc.
The number of members elected in each country depends on the size of the population, ranging from six for Malta, Luxembourg and Cyprus to 96 for Germany. In 2019, Europeans elected 751 lawmakers. Following the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU in 2020, the number of MEPs fell to 705. Some of the 73 seats previously held by British MEPs were redistributed to other member states.
The lawmakers, known as Members of the European Parliament, or MEPs, can vote on a wide range of legislation covering banking rules, climate, agriculture, fisheries, security and justice. They also vote on the EU budget, which is crucial to the implementation of European policies, including, for instance, the aid delivered to Ukraine.
After the election, MEPs will elect their president at the first plenary session, from July 16-19. Then, most likely in September, they will nominate the president of the European Commission, following a proposal made by the member states. In 2019, von der Leyen narrowly won a vote to become the first woman to head the institution. She is seeking a second term.

3463,fake,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-04-03,"In the latest obvious attack on God, believers, and the biblical worldview, the Biden Democrats used a high-profile opportunity to offend Christians. Days before Easter, they banned religious (read “Christian”) images at the White House and also declared March 31 (Resurrection Sunday) the “Transgender Day of Visibility.”
Make no mistake: this is the new religion of the Left. Vice President Kamala Harris passionately proclaimed, …“we celebrate transgender and nonbinary Americans,” and said, “We won’t stop fighting for you.”
Well, they did put a bunny rabbit (which has nothing to do with Jesus) in the White House logo.
As criticism erupted and Christian leaders called out the agenda-driven Democrats for ignoring our most important holy day, the White House said it was just a bunch of fake news or misinformation. They claimed believers, conservatives, and family-oriented Americans were making a big deal of this and taking it out of context.
Using the old blame-shifting tactic, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre responded defiantly to those who took offense to the celebration of trans ideology on a day Christians celebrate the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. She stated:
“It is actually unsurprising that politicians are seeking to divide and weaken our country with cruel, hateful, and dishonest rhetoric; …It is untrue what we heard over the weekend”
Note the very thing the left does, they accuse others of doing.
Now it is a fact that since 2009, President Obama’s first year in office, Democrat socialists have observed International Transgender Day of Visibility on March 31. Many suggest it should be on April 1 but that’s for another conversation.
President Joe Biden has released a proclamation every year he has been in office and this year is the first year it fell on Easter. Does anyone think they didn’t see this coming?
Jean-Pierre offered to explain things for the uneducated masses of America, adding;
“for folks who understand the calendar and how it works, Easter falls on different Sundays, right, every year. And this year it happened to coincide with Transgender Visibility Day.”
So, the problem was simply that one inconvenient Christian holy day – whose meaning goes back thousands of years in history – got in the way of their post-modern celebration. But one confusing thing she said referring to Biden was:
“And as a Christian who celebrates Easter with family, President Biden stands for bringing people together and upholding the dignity and freedoms of every American.”
Newsflash! Biden, a Christian? He doesn’t divide people but brings them together? He stand for “upholding dignity and freedoms of every American,” even Bible-believing Christ-followers? Evidence proves otherwise, and we know them by their rotten fruit.
To try and portray trans-identifying individuals as oppressed or victims, Marxist leftists often highlight stats pointing to their emotional and mental suffering. But they blame God, Christians, America, biology, and Republicans for skyrocketing depression or suicide rates. They say it’s all due to “bullying and discrimination.”
Tragically, they are doing these confused and deceived people a disservice.
I agree with Benny Johnson who said on Twitter X that Biden’s actions were a slap in the face to Christians. “I have your back,” the White House proclamation reads, directed to the transgender community, which, by the way, is a mere fraction of a percentage of U.S. citizens.
But let’s talk about the censoring of religious symbols for a moment. Would it not be accurate to draw parallels to what the Nazis did by removing crosses, Bibles, and Christian symbols? They had to be replaced with something, right? And they were.
The Washington Stand’s Ben Johnson explains:
The Biden administration’s revolution began where all revolutions begin: with children. The 2024 “Celebrating National Guard Families” art contest, which is part of the White House Easter Egg Roll, asks children of servicemembers to submit designs for Easter eggs — but not any that highlight the actual content of Easter. The contest’s flyer instructs children they “must not include any questionable content, religious symbols, overtly religious themes, or partisan political statements.”
The agenda to eradicate biblical Christianity from American culture has been many decades in the making and very effective. Antonio Gramsci would be proud.
For the record, eleven proclamations went out from the White House the Friday before Easter, most of which were for the month of April. This further proves my point.
According to Not The Bee, ten of the holidays Democrats feel more important than the holiest day on the Christian calendar include:
- Arab American Heritage Month
- Second Chance Month
- Month of the Military Child
- Care Workers Recognition Month
- National Child Abuse Prevention Month
- National Public Health Week
- National Cancer Prevention and Early Detection Month
- National Donate Life Month
- National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, and
- Cesar Chavez Day
It’s not that these are bad. The point is this exemplifies bias by omission. The Biden administration can go out of its way to recognize a socialist like Chavez, but the “devout Catholic” president can’t throw a sideways mention to Jesus or Easter?
They purposely ignored Resurrection Sunday in 2023 and 2022 as well.
It is insulting we keep hearing the left demand more exposure of all things LGBTQ when this religious cult is oversaturating the nation. It began with the idea ‘gay is okay,’ then Pride Month, of course. And then it was about getting married. That’s all they wanted, right?
Wrong. Today they access young children using drag queens, big tech, Hollywood, the media, and government schools to groom, I mean, recruit countless children, the real victims, into this abhorrent ideology. Queer all year more accurately describes this effort to fill the entire country with the marketing of evil.
Franklin Graham didn’t hold back as he confronted the Biden Democrats for disrespecting God and hundreds of millions of religious Americans. He stated:
On the most significant day of the Christian calendar, when the Church around the world celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ who died and shed His blood for the sins of mankind, the Biden administration uses this opportunity to flaunt sin, to glorify sin, and to celebrate sin. The Bible says, “…they proclaim their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to them!” (Isaiah 3:9). Judgment is coming. Instead of celebrating sin, we need to confess our sins, repent of our sins, and ask for God’s forgiveness.
Unless they repent and turn to Jesus, judgment is coming for those who mock God, push the lie that you can be born in the wrong body, and call it “healthcare” to murder babies in the womb or permanently mutilate a person’s body with trans surgeries.
And that’s one of the biggest reasons to resist this demonic agenda. It is a blatant attack on the truth that every human being was created in the very image of God. Someone should write a book about these mounting attacks. (see Assault on the Image of God)
As Lila Rose, founder of Live Action said, this evil is “destroying a whole generation of kids.” Christians and and concerned citizens must speak out while we still can, loud and clear against this wickedness."
2461,real,INSTITUTIONAL_AND_MEDIA_DISTRUST_PUBLIC_INSTITUTIONS,2024-05-02,"Russian state media is posting more on TikTok ahead of the U.S. presidential election, study says
Russian state-affiliated accounts have boosted their use of TikTok and are getting more engagement on the short-form video platform ahead of the U.S. presidential election, according to a study published Thursday by the nonprofit Brookings Institution.
The report states that Russia is increasingly leveraging TikTok to disseminate Kremlin messages in both English and Spanish, with state-linked accounts posting far more frequently on the platform than they did two years ago.
Such accounts are also active on other social media platforms and have a larger presence on Telegram and X than on TikTok. However, the report says user engagement — such as likes, views and shares — on their posts has been much higher on TikTok than on either Telegram or X.
“The use of TikTok highlights a growing, but still not fully realized, avenue for Russia’s state-backed information apparatus to reach new, young audiences,” reads the report, which drew data from 70 different state-affiliated accounts and was authored by Valerie Wirtschafter, a Brookings fellow in foreign policy and its artificial intelligence initiative.
The study notes that most posts do not focus on U.S. politics but other issues, like the war in Ukraine and NATO. However, those that do tend to feature more divisive topics like U.S. policy on Israel and Russia, and questions around President Joe Biden’s age, the Brookings report says.
A TikTok spokesperson said the company has removed covert influence operations in the past and eliminated accounts, including 13 networks operating from Russia.
The spokesperson said TikTok also labels state-controlled media accounts and will expand that policy in the coming weeks “to further address accounts that attempt to reach communities outside their home country on current global events and affairs.”
The Brookings report comes after Biden last month signed legislation forcing TikTok’s parent company — China-based ByteDance — to sell the platform or face a ban in the U.S. The potential ban is expected to face legal challenges."
5904,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-10-31,"Latest reports show the EU is bucking a global trend for continuously rising emissions, but still not on track to meet its own climate action targets.
The EU’s climate commissioner has seized on a sharp fall in emissions across the bloc as evidence that climate action is not incompatible with economic growth, as he prepares for the major UN climate summit in Azerbaijan next month.
“As we head off soon to COP29, we once again demonstrate to our international partners that it is possible to take climate action and invest in growing our economy at the same time,” Wopke Hoekstra said as the European Commission published the 2024 edition of its annual EU Climate Action Progress Report.
The headline figure was an 8.3% drop in greenhouse gas emissions, a fall not seen since the anomaly of 2020, when covid pandemic lockdowns combined with mild weather to reduce carbon output by 9.8%, followed by a rapid rebound.
While emissions in Europe are now 37% below the baseline year of 1990, the union is still a long way from its 2030 target of net reduction of at least 55%.
The drop, based on preliminary data from national governments, brings the EU’s annual carbon footprint measured in CO2 equivalent to just 6% of a global total of 53 billion tonnes a year – a record figure that represents a 1.9% increase on 2022 worldwide.
“Sadly, the report also shows that our work must continue, at home and abroad, as we are seeing the harm that climate change is causing our citizens,” added Hoekstra, who will head the EU’s negotiating team in the Azeri capital Baku, where the COP29 opens on 11 November.
The fall in emissions is distributed highly unevenly across sectors. The power stations and factories that must pay for each tonne of CO2 they emit under EU emissions trading scheme have seen CO2 equivalent output fall by over 47% since it came into effect in 2005.
Emissions linked to buildings, agriculture, domestic transport, small industry and waste fell by a relatively modest 2% in 2023. The biggest increase was in aviation, with emissions up 9.5% year on year.
Releasing its ‘Trends and Projections’ report in parallel today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) put Europe’s shrinking carbon footprint down mainly to a significant decline in the burning of coal, combined with continuing deployment of renewable energy sources like wind and solar and an overall drop in energy demand.
The EEA balanced Hoekstra’s bullish tone with a warning about an apparent lack of commitment among EU governments to push emissions down further, in line with longer-term targets.
Existing climate action measures would result in only a 43% reduction by 2030, and even additional projections submitted by 22 member states point to only a 49% reduction overall, and that is based on “planned but not yet launched measures”.
Leena Ylä-Mononen, EEA executive director, said “comprehensive action across all sectors” would be needed to over the next quarter century to meet the EU’s ultimate – and legally binding – goal of reaching zet-zero emissions.
“As our recent European climate risk assessment revealed, the impact of climate change is accelerating,” Ylä-Mononen said. “This leaves us no choice but to strengthen our resilience to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”"

The following 33 population control quotes reveal that the elite truly believe the human race is a plague upon the earth and that a great culling is necessary:
1. UK Television Presenter Sir David Attenborough: “We are a plague on the Earth. It’s coming home to roost over the next 50 years or so. It’s not just climate change; it’s sheer space, places to grow food for this enormous horde. Either we limit our population growth or the natural world will do it for us, and the natural world is doing it for us right now”
2. Paul Ehrlich, a former science adviser to president George W. Bush and the author of “The Population Bomb”: “To our minds, the fundamental cure, reducing the scale of the human enterprise (including the size of the population) to keep its aggregate consumption within the carrying capacity of Earth is obvious but too much neglected or denied.”
3. Paul Ehrlich again, this time on the size of families: “Nobody, in my view, has the right to have 12 children or even three unless the second pregnancy is twins”
4. Dave Foreman, the co-founder of Earth First: “We humans have become a disease, the Humanpox.
5. CNN Founder Ted Turner: “A total world population of 250-300 million people, a 95% decline from present levels, would be ideal.”
He was quoted saying: “We’re too many people; that’s why we have global warming.”
Unfortunately for him and other fervent depopulationists, both the overpopulation myth and the man-made global warming hoax, have been repeatedly debunked.
6. Japan’s Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso about medical patients with serious illnesses: “You cannot sleep well when you think it’s all paid by the government. This won’t be solved unless you let them hurry up and die.”
7. David Rockefeller: “The negative impact of population growth on all of our planetary ecosystems is becoming appallingly evident.”
8. Environmental activist Roger Martin: “On a finite planet, the optimum population providing the best quality of life for all, is clearly much smaller than the maximum, permitting bare survival. The more we are, the less for each; fewer people mean better lives.”
9. HBO personality Bill Maher: “I’m pro-choice, I’m for assisted suicide, I’m for regular suicide, I’m for whatever gets the freeway moving – that’s what I’m for. It’s too crowded, the planet is too crowded and we need to promote death.”
10. MIT professor Penny Chisholm: “The real trick is, in terms of trying to level off at someplace lower than that 9 billion, is to get the birthrates in the developing countries to drop as fast as we can. And that will determine the level at which humans will level off on earth.”
11. Julia Whitty, a columnist for Mother Jones: “The only known solution to ecological overshoot is to decelerate our population growth faster than it’s decelerating now and eventually reverse it — at the same time we slow and eventually reverse the rate at which we consume the planet’s resources.
Success in these twin endeavors will crack our most pressing global issues: climate change, food scarcity, water supplies, immigration, health care, biodiversity loss, even war. On one front, we’ve already made unprecedented strides, reducing global fertility from an average 4.92 children per woman in 1950 to 2.56 today — an accomplishment of trial and sometimes brutally coercive error, but also a result of one woman at a time making her individual choices. The speed of this childbearing revolution, swimming hard against biological programming, rates as perhaps our greatest collective feat to date.”
12. Colorado State University Professor Philip Cafaro in a paper entitled “Climate Ethics and Population Policy”: “Ending human population growth is almost certainly a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for preventing catastrophic global climate change. Indeed, significantly reducing current human numbers may be necessary in order to do so.“
13. Professor of Biology at the University of Texas at Austin Eric R. Pianka: “I do not bear any ill will toward people. However, I am convinced that the world, including all humanity, WOULD clearly be much better off without so many of us.”
14. Detroit News Columnist Nolan Finley: “Since the national attention is on birth control, here’s my idea: If we want to fight poverty, reduce violent crime and bring down our embarrassing drop-out rate, we should swap contraceptives for fluoride in Michigan’s drinking water.
We’ve got a baby problem in Michigan. Too many babies are born to immature parents who don’t have the skills to raise them, too many are delivered by poor women who can’t afford them, and too many are fathered by sorry layabouts who spread their seed like dandelions and then wander away from the consequences.”
15. John Guillebaud, professor of family planning at University College London: “The effect on the planet of having one child less is an order of magnitude greater than all these other things we might do, such as switching off lights. An extra child is the equivalent of a lot of flights across the planet.”
16. Democrat strategist Steven Rattner: “WE need death panels. Well, maybe not death panels, exactly, but unless we start allocating health care resources more prudently — rationing, by its proper name — the exploding cost of Medicare will swamp the federal budget.”
17. Matthew Yglesias, a business and economics correspondent for Slate, in an article entitled “The Case for Death Panels, in One Chart”:
“But not only is this health care spending on the elderly the key issue in the federal budget, our disproportionate allocation of health care dollars to old people surely accounts for the remarkable lack of apparent cost effectiveness of the American health care system. When the patient is already over 80, the simple fact of the matter is that no amount of treatment is going to work miracles in terms of life expectancy or quality of life.”
18. Planned Parenthood Founder Margaret Sanger: “All of our problems are the result of overbreeding among the working class”
19. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: “Frankly I had thought that at the time Roe was decided, there was concern about population growth and particularly growth in populations that we don’t want to have too many of.”
20. Planned Parenthood Founder Margaret Sanger: “The most merciful thing that the large family does to one of its infant members is to kill it.”
21. Salon columnist Mary Elizabeth Williams in an article entitled “So What If Abortion Ends Life?”: “All life is not equal. That’s a difficult thing for liberals like me to talk about, lest we wind up looking like death-panel-loving, kill-your-grandma-and-your-precious-baby storm troopers. Yet a fetus can be a human life without having the same rights as the woman in whose body it resides.”
22. Alberto Giubilini of Monash University in Melbourne, Australia and Francesca Minerva of the University of Melbourne in a paper published in the Journal of Medical Ethics:
“[W]hen circumstances occur after birth such that they would have justified abortion, what we call after-birth abortion should be permissible. … [W]e propose to call this practice ‘after-birth abortion’, rather than ‘infanticide,’ to emphasize that the moral status of the individual killed is comparable with that of a fetus … rather than to that of a child.
“Therefore, we claim that killing a newborn could be ethically permissible in all the circumstances where abortion would be. Such circumstances include cases where the newborn has the potential to have an (at least) acceptable life, but the well-being of the family is at risk.”
23. Nina Fedoroff, a key adviser to Hillary Clinton: “We need to continue to decrease the growth rate of the global population; the planet can’t support many more people.”
24. Barack Obama’s primary science adviser, John P. Holdren: “A program of sterilizing women after their second or third child, despite the relatively greater difficulty of the operation than vasectomy, might be easier to implement than trying to sterilize men.
The development of a long-term sterilizing capsule that could be implanted under the skin and removed when pregnancy is desired opens additional possibilities for coercive fertility control. The capsule could be implanted at puberty and might be removable, with official permission, for a limited number of births.”
25. David Brower, the first Executive Director of the Sierra Club: “Childbearing [should be] a punishable crime against society, unless the parents hold a government license … All potential parents [should be] required to use contraceptive chemicals, the government issuing antidotes to citizens chosen for childbearing.”
26. Thomas Ferguson, former official in the U.S. State Department Office of Population Affairs: “There is a single theme behind all our work–we must reduce population levels. Either governments do it our way, through nice clean methods, or they will get the kinds of mess that we have in El Salvador, or in Iran or in Beirut. Population is a political problem. Once population is out of control, it requires authoritarian government, even fascism, to reduce it…”
27. Mikhail Gorbachev: “We must speak more clearly about sexuality, contraception, about abortion, about values that control population, because the ecological crisis, in short, is the population crisis. Cut the population by 90% and there aren’t enough people left to do a great deal of ecological damage.”
28. Jacques Costeau: “In order to stabilize world population, we must eliminate 350,000 people per day. It is a horrible thing to say, but it is just as bad not to say it.”
29. Finnish environmentalist Pentti Linkola: “If there were a button I could press, I would sacrifice myself without hesitating if it meant millions of people would die”
30. Prince Phillip, husband of Queen Elizabeth II and co-founder of the World Wildlife Fund: “In the event that I am reincarnated, I would like to return as a deadly virus, in order to contribute something to solve overpopulation.”
31. Henry Kissinger, a top architect of the New World Order, is believed by many to be one of the biggest war criminals alive. He has worked hard to put his depopulation plans into action.
He was also quoted saying:
“Depopulation should be the highest priority of foreign policy towards the third world, because the US economy will require large and increasing amounts of minerals from abroad, especially from less developed countries”.
32. English primatologist Jane Goodall, a WEF agenda contributor, told her fellow globalists that they could “save the planet” from “global warming” if the Earth’s population was 90 percent smaller than it is today.
33. Bill Gates is possibly the most dangerous and obsessed depopulationist in the world today. The Microsoft founder’s father was head of Planned Parenthood and has influenced his views on population control from an early age.
In a TEDx lecture, he explains that one way to lower the CO2 levels (which, by the way, are not a problem AT ALL, since the total CO2 level) by decreasing the human population:
“The world today has 6.8 billion people. That’s heading up to about nine billion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care & reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.”"

WASHINGTON (AP) — Another six Republican states are piling on to challenge the Biden administration’s newly expanded campus sexual assault rules, saying they overstep the president’s authority and undermine the Title IX anti-discrimination law.
A federal lawsuit, led by Tennessee and West Virginia, on Tuesday asks a judge to halt and overturn the new policy. The suit is joined by Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana and Virginia. It follows other legal challenges filed by Monday by nine other states including Alabama, Louisiana and Texas.
The lawsuits are the first to challenge the administration’s new Title IX rules, which expand protections to LGBTQ+ students and add new safeguards for victims of sexual assault. The policy was finalized in April and takes effect in August.
Central to the dispute is a new provision expanding Title IX to LGBTQ+ students. The 1972 law forbids discrimination based on sex in education. Under the new rules, Title IX will also protect against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
The states involved say it amounts to an illegal rewriting of the landmark legislation.
They argue it will clash with their own laws, including those restricting which bathrooms and locker rooms transgender students can use, banning them from using facilities that align with their new gender identity.
“The U.S. Department of Education has no authority to let boys into girls’ locker rooms,” Tennessee Attorney General Skrmetti said in a statement. “In the decades since its adoption, Title IX has been universally understood to protect the privacy and safety of women in private spaces like locker rooms and bathrooms.”
The administration’s new rules broadly protect against discrimination based on sex, but they don’t offer guidance around transgender athletes. The Education Department has promised a separate rule on that issue later.
Yet in their suits, Republican states argue that the latest update could be interpreted to apply to athletics.
“Men who identify as women will, among other things, have the right to compete within programs and activities that Congress made available to women so they can fairly and fully pursue academic and athletic excellence — turning Title IX’s protections on their head,” says the suit led by Tennessee and West Virginia.
As a legal basis for the new rules, the Education Department cited a 2020 Supreme Court case protecting gay, lesbian and transgender people from discrimination in employment.
The new suit challenges that justification, saying the Supreme Court declined to address scenarios implicated by Title IX, “such as a school that does not allow a transgender student to use the restroom or participate in sports associated with the student’s gender identity.”
Among other things, the suits also take exception to the policy changes dictating how schools and colleges must handle complaints of sexual assault.
The administration’s new rules were proposed nearly two years ago, with a public comment period that drew 240,000 responses, a record for the Education Department.
The policy rolls back many of the changes implemented during the Trump administration, which added more protections for students accused of sexual misconduct.

The fight to allow same-sex marriage and gay clergy has defined much of the last half-century for major mainline Protestant denominations in the U.S., mirroring in many ways the broader fight for LGBTQ+ inclusion in civic life.
Within these theologically moderate-to-progressive Protestant groups, the decades of wrestling over whether to reaffirm or overturn longstanding anti-LGBTQ+ church policies sowed deep divisions throughout the denominations. It’s caused hurt feelings, broken relationships, disciplinary church trials and schisms.
The United Methodist Church, which stripped out its bans and related social teachings over the past two weeks, is the last of the major mainline church bodies to go through this process.
This timeline highlights key milestones and flashpoints within the UMC, Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), Episcopal Church, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, United Church of Christ, as well as in civic life.

3641,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-08-19,"- There is no evidence to suggest that gay or bisexual men are biologically more susceptible to mpox.
- Rather, health experts warn that the virus is spreading within that community due largely to human habits, and the World Health Organization has previously said men who have sex with other men are a vulnerable population.
- Mpox is a virus that can be spread through respiratory droplets and skin-to-skin contact, and thus sexual activities in general.
In mid-August 2024, the director-general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, declared mpox a ""public health emergency of international concern"" because of a growing number of cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other African nations.
As the virus — which was formerly known as monkeypox — spread, some social media users began sharing posts that misstated scientific facts about the disease to exaggerate its danger. One such user posted (archived) headlines about the spread of the disease between men and about cases in children in an attempt to imply a connection between homosexuality and pedophilia.
That post dredged up a claim shared widely 2022, when the virus spread outside of its endemic African range to areas it isn't normally reported in — including the United States and parts of Europe. Social media posts (archived) implied then that the properties of mpox allow the virus to spread faster among men who have sex with men, or that gay and bisexual men are more susceptible to infection:
This was not true. As far as medical health experts are concerned, there is nothing about the mpox virus that targets gay or bisexual men over others. Neither does AIDS, for that matter. Transmission within such communities is largely due to human behavior — not how the virus itself behaves within infected people's immune systems.
In 2022, it was true that mpox spread faster within some communities of men who have sex with other men, giving public health officials reason to issue public warnings to the LGBTQ+ community. Put another way, men who have sex with other men were found to be more susceptible to the virus compared to other people, simply because of who was infected and where, not because of biological properties of the virus. Transmission can simply be explained by human behavior. (More on that below.)
A leading adviser to the WHO told The Associated Press in 2022 that the ""unprecedented outbreak"" that year likely began through sexual transmission during two raves in Spain and Belgium.
""We know monkeypox can spread when there is close contact with the lesions of someone who is infected, and it looks like sexual contact has now amplified that transmission,"" Dr. David Heymann said.
As we have previously reported, mpox is a DNA virus related to smallpox in the poxvirus group. (DNA viruses are those that have genomes that can be replicated by the host, meaning that they use the host to make copies of themselves to further spread through the body during the course of infection.) Mpox infections are rare, but they can lead to serious complications that begin with flulike symptoms and progress to a widespread rash on the face and body.
Though not easily transmitted between people (the virus mainly spreads from infected animals to humans), human-to-human transmission occurs through the swapping of bodily fluids and touch — including sexual activities if contact is made with the lesions of an infected person — as well as shared personal items, such as contaminated clothing and bedding. Health experts recommend avoiding contact with anyone who is exhibiting symptoms, and for symptomatic individuals to isolate at home and talk to a health worker.
""Stigmatizing people because of a disease is never ok. Anyone can get or pass on monkeypox, regardless of their sexuality,"" the WHO said.
With regard to the 2022 outbreak, the WHO issued a public health advisory for men who have sex with other men.
""Some cases have been identified through sexual health clinics in communities of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. It is important to note that the risk of monkeypox is not limited to men who have sex with men. Anyone who has close contact with someone who is infectious is at risk,"" the global health agency said.
Although a sizable amount of mpox cases in 2022 were confirmed in men who have sex with men, there is no evidence to suggest that gay or bisexual men are biologically more susceptible to the virus. Rather, health experts warn that the virus is spreading within that community due largely to human habits. Regardless of a person's sexuality, they can become infected with mpox through sexual contact — or any physical contact, for that matter — with an infected person either via respiratory droplets or by touching skin lesions and bodily fluids."
2491,real,INSTITUTIONAL_AND_MEDIA_DISTRUST_PUBLIC_INSTITUTIONS,2024-05-26,"Fighting for votes in 'the world's biggest data mine'
They are the apps every Indian has on their phone - the one where you order your taxi, your food, find your next date. Innocuous, everyday, unremarkable to billions around the world.
In India, these are also potentially the apps telling politicians everything they could possibly want to know about you - whether you want them to or not.
A person's religion, mother tongue, ""the way you draft a message to your friend on social media"" have all become points of data politicians are keen to get their hands on, according to political strategist Rutwik Joshi, who is working with at least a dozen unnamed lawmakers on their re-election campaigns this election.
And India’s combination of high smartphone take-up and lax regulations allowing private companies to sell data mean that most political parties have gathered ""the data to do everything"" - even down to knowing “what you are eating today"", he claims.
The question is, why do they care?
Put simply, says Mr Joshi, this level of information can predict the vote - ""and these predictions usually never go wrong"".
But perhaps the bigger question is: why should you care?
Microtargeting - described by Privacy International as the use of personal data “to target you with information and adverts to an unprecedented degree of personalisation” - is not new when it comes to elections.
But it was in the wake of former US President Donald Trump’s 2016 win that it really hit the headlines.
Back then, political consultancy Cambridge Analytica was credited with helping him to victory using data sold by Facebook to profile people and send them pro-Trump content. The firm denied these allegations but suspended its CEO, Alexander Nix.
In 2022, Meta agreed to pay $725m (£600m) to settle a class action lawsuit over a data breach linked to Cambridge Analytica.
It left people questioning whether the adverts they had seen had swayed their votes. Countries around the world were concerned enough about the impact on democracy that they swung into action.
In India, a Cambridge Analytica affiliate said the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the opposition Congress party were its clients - which both denied.
The country's then IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad also warned of action against the company and Facebook if it misused data of Indian citizens.
But there has since been little to stop micro-targeting of voters, data and security researcher Srinivas Kodali says.
""Every other election commission - like in the UK and Singapore - they all tried to understand the role of data and micro targeting in elections, they created certain forms of checks and balances, which is what normally an election commission should be doing, but we are not seeing that happen in India,"" he says.
In India, the problem is compounded because it's ""a data society that was planned and built by the government without any safeguards"", Mr Kodali says.
Indeed, there are some 650m smartphones users in the country - all boasting apps which could potentially share their data with a third party.
But you don't necessarily need a smartphone to be vulnerable: one of the biggest holders of personal data is the government itself – and even it has been selling personal information to private companies.
“The government built large databases of citizens, shared it with the private sector,” Mr Kodali says.
This has all left citizens vulnerable to increased surveillance with little control over what information remains private, warns Prateek Waghre, executive director at the digital rights organisation Internet Freedom Foundation.
Meanwhile, a data protection law passed by the government last year is yet to be implemented, experts say. The lack of rules is an issue, says Mr Kodali.
""It's like the wild, wild west - except on the internet.""
And the result of all of this available data? As Mr Joshi puts it, India entered the election year as ""the biggest possible data mine in the world right now"".
The thing is, no one is doing anything illegal, says Mr Joshi.
"" I am not asking [the app], 'Give me mobile numbers of how many users you have and all the contact numbers of those users as well'. But I can ask, 'Are people eating veg or non-veg in your area?'"" he explains.
And the apps are able to hand over that data – because the user gave them permission.
""For example, there are 10 different Indian apps in your mobile phone - you have given access to your contacts, to your gallery, to your mic, to your speakers, to your location, including the live location,"" Mr Joshi, whose company, Neeti I, has been using data to understand voter behaviour patterns in particular constituencies, says.
And it is this data – along with data collected by party workers - which is then used to help decide who the candidate should be, where the candidate's wife should go to do a puja or aarti (offer prayers), what kind of speeches they should give - even what to wear.
But does this level of targeting really work to change people’s mind? That remains unclear.
But campaigners say on a basic level, it is a violation of people’s privacy. Extrapolating it further, having this level of detail could be used against people in the future.
""Just the fact that it is happening is problematic."" says Pratik Waghre, executive director at the digital rights organisation Internet Freedom Foundation.
""What we've seen is that there often doesn't seem to be a clear distinction between how data is being handled when someone is beneficiary of a government scheme and how that information is then being used by that particular political party which happens to be in power in a particular state or at a national level to then use that to micro target people with campaign messages.""
The law also allows the government and government bodies to exempt themselves from vast sections on its discretion. It also has the powers to process, use or share this personal data with third parties.
Mr Waghre fears future administrations could take it a step further.
""It can also be: ‘Let's collectively see who's supporting us and only give them the benefits’.”
The use of such data also comes against the backdrop of India's larger misinformation problem, Mr Kodali says. And when combined with the amount of data on offer, it is a real problem.
""When you talk about artificial intelligence, targeted advertisements, micro targeting of voters - a lot of this falls under the idea of computational propaganda,"" he explains. ""Questions of this were raised heavily during the 2016 Trump election, where this election is considered as something that was influenced by foreign actors.""
Mr Kodali says use of data and technology in election campaigns must be regulated just like money and ad spending currently is in order to keep elections fair.
“If you have one or few set of political parties or groups with access to these technologies gaming elections, they may be free but they will stop looking fair,” he warns.

Citing the Nairobi Declaration and projects already underway on the continent as evidence of Africa's commitment to clean energy, he highlighted the transformative power of renewable energy to drive industrialization, economic growth, and sustainable development.
""From Cairo to Cape Town, renewable energy can revolutionize lives,"" he said, noting its potential to deliver affordable electricity, improve health outcomes, and lower costs for millions.
The benefits of renewables extend far beyond energy access, as they offer Africa a chance to spearhead a global clean energy revolution and secure economic prosperity for future generations, Guterres stressed.
Update NDCs
The Secretary-General called on all countries to update their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by next year, aligning their policies with global energy transition goals and limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. He underscored the role of these commitments in attracting investment to align national energy strategies with climate action and development priorities.
Guterres emphasized that the G20 nations, as the biggest emitters, must take the lead in phasing out fossil fuels. Nevertheless, he urged all countries to seize the opportunity for progress.
Overcoming financial barriers
Despite having 60% of the world's best solar resources, Africa accounts for only 1% of installed solar capacity, with 600 million people still lacking electricity access.
Guterres called for a fundamental overhaul of the international financial system, urging developed nations to meet their climate finance commitments. He advocated for a new global financial framework that includes innovative funding mechanisms, such as levies on shipping, aviation, and fossil fuel extraction, as well as reforms to multilateral development banks to increase concessional lending.
These reforms, the Secretary-General said, are critical to bridging the investment gap and driving Africa's clean energy revolution.
Critical minerals
Africa's rich deposits of critical minerals essential for renewable energy technologies were another focal point of the address. Guterres bemoaned the exploitation of these resources, which has left African countries at the bottom of global value chains.
To address this, he called for a shift toward sustainable and equitable resource management, ensuring that African countries reap the benefits of their mineral wealth. He highlighted the United Nations Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals as a tool to embed justice, fairness, and human rights across the critical minerals value chain.
Addressing climate injustice
Guterres also spoke about the disproportionate impact of the climate crisis on Africa, which contributes minimally to global emissions but suffers severe consequences. He called for developed nations to double adaptation financing to $40 billion annually by 2025 and to provide substantial contributions to the newly established Loss and Damage Fund.
""Africa belongs at the forefront of the renewables revolution,"" Guterres said. ""Together, we can harness its green momentum to power a prosperous, sustainable future."""
3480,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-09-17,"TBILISI, Georgia — Georgian lawmakers on Tuesday approved the third and final reading of a law on “family values and the protection of minors” that would impose sweeping curbs on LGBTQ rights.
The bill would provide a legal basis for authorities to outlaw Pride events and public displays of the LGBT rainbow flag, and to impose censorship of films and books.
Leaders of the governing Georgian Dream party say it is needed to safeguard traditional moral standards in Georgia, whose deeply conservative Orthodox Church is highly influential.
Activists say the measure is aimed at boosting conservative support for the government ahead of a parliamentary election on Oct. 26 in Georgia, a country that has ambitions to join the European Union but which Western governments fear is now tilting back towards Russia.
Tamara Jakeli, director of campaign group Tbilisi Pride, said the bill, which also restates an existing ban on same-sex marriage and bans gender reassignment surgery, would likely force her organization to close its doors.
“This law is the most terrible thing to happen to the LGBT community in Georgia,” Jakeli, 28, told Reuters. “We will most likely have to shut down. There is no way for us to continue functioning.”
Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili, a critic of Georgian Dream whose powers are mostly ceremonial, has indicated that she will block the bill. But Georgian Dream and its allies have enough seats in parliament to override her veto.
LGBT rights are a fraught topic in Georgia, where polls show broad disapproval of same-sex relationships, and the constitution bans same-sex marriage. Participants in Tbilisi’s annual Pride marches have come under physical attack by anti-LGBT protesters in recent years.
The issue has become more prominent ahead of October’s election, where Georgian Dream is seeking a fourth term in office and is campaigning heavily against LGBT rights.
The ruling party, whose top candidate for the election is billionaire ex-prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, has deepened ties with neighboring Russia as relations with Western countries have soured.
Earlier this year, it passed a law on “foreign agents” that the European and U.S. critics said is authoritarian and Russian-inspired. Its passage sparked some of the largest protests Georgia has seen since independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
Opinion polls show the party, which in 2014 passed a law banning anti-LGBT discrimination before later pivoting to more conservative positions, remains Georgia’s most popular, though it has lost ground since 2020, when it won a narrow majority in parliament.
In one ruling party advert aired on Georgian television, Pride director Jakeli’s face is shown alongside the words: “No to moral degradation.”
Jakeli said that the bill could only be stopped if Georgian Dream were to lose power in October, though she noted that the country’s opposition parties are not overtly supportive of LGBT rights.
“The only way we can survive in this country and have any progress on LGBT rights is for us to go in great numbers to the elections and vote for change,” she said."
3563,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-09-19,"Trans woman killed in Georgia day after anti-LGBT law passed
One of Georgia's most well-known transgender women has been killed in her home, a day after the country's parliament passed a major anti-LGBT bill.
Local officials say Kesaria Abramidze, 37, was stabbed to death in her flat in the capital, Tbilisi, on Wednesday.
The interior ministry said it was investigating a ""premeditated murder committed with particular cruelty and aggravating circumstances on gender grounds"".
A 26-year-old man has been arrested in the case that has shocked the small South Caucasian nation. Georgian media reported he was known to the victim.
Rights groups have linked the killing to the new anti-LGBT law, arguing the government's promotion of it had fuelled transphobic hate crime.
Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili, who opposed the new law, said the ""horrendous murder"" raised urgent questions about hate crimes and discrimination.
The legislation from Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze's government severely restricts rights for LGBT people.
It introduces a ban on same-sex marriage, gender-affirming surgeries, child adoption by non-heterosexuals and the promotion of same-sex relationships in schools.
The bill sailed through parliament on Tuesday in an 84-0 vote, despite criticism from rights groups.
The ruling party said the ""Protection of Family Values and Minors"" bill was designed to protect a majority of Georgians seeking protection from ""LGBT propaganda"".
But local LGBT rights campaigners said the government had used homophobic and transphobic language and ideas in promoting the bill.
Several activists directly linked what they said was the government's harmful rhetoric to the killing of Ms Abramidze.
One of the first openly trans public figures in the country, she had represented Georgia in international trans pageants and had more than 500,000 followers on social media.
""Political homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia have become central to the government’s official discourse and ideology,"" said local human rights group the Social Justice Center.
""Kesaria Abramidze's killing cannot be viewed separately from this overall grave context,"" it added.
Progressive politicians outside the country have also linked the killing to the government's legislative agenda.
""Those who sow hatred will reap violence. Kesaria Abramidze was killed just one day after the Georgian parliament passed the anti-LGBTI law,” wrote German lawmaker Michael Roth, the social democratic chair of the country's foreign affairs committee.
European Union figures had already condemned the legislation when it passed earlier this week, saying it further jeopardised the country's stated aim of joining the EU.
Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign policy chief, said the law was ""further derailing the country from its EU path"". He called on the Georgian government to withdraw the law.
The legislation undermines the ""fundamental rights of the people"" and increases discrimination and stigmatisation, he added.
The British embassy has also expressed ""serious concerns"".
Rights groups have characterised the Georgian legislation as being similar to Russian laws which severely restrict LGBT rights.
The Washington-based think tank Freedom House said the bill was ""pulled directly from the Kremlin's authoritarian playbook""."
2236,real,ANTI_MIGRATION_AND_XENOPHOBIA,2024-01-17,"The European court of human rights has ruled that Greece violated a Syrian refugee’s right to life when coastguards fired more than a dozen rounds at the people smugglers’ boat he was on nearly a decade ago.
The Strasbourg-based court ordered Greece to pay €80,000 (about £68,000) in damages to the wife and two children of Belal Tello, who was shot in the head as Greek coastguards attempted to halt the boat he was travelling in. Tello died in 2015, after months in hospital.
In a ruling published on Tuesday, the court said the coastguards “had not exercised the necessary vigilance in minimising any risk to life”.
It linked their actions to Greece’s failure to put in place regulations on the use of potentially lethal force during coastguard operations. “The coastguards had thus used excessive force in the context of unclear regulations on the use of firearms,” the court said.
The ruling traces back to September 2014, when coastguards ordered a motorboat near the eastern Aegean island of Pserimos to stop. The vessel, which was carrying 14 people across the narrow strip of sea between Turkey and Greece’s Aegean islands, instead began launching into what the court described as “dangerous manoeuvres”, colliding with the coastguard patrol boat on “two or three occasions”.
The coastguard fired seven warning shots and 13 shots at the outboard motor, the court said, citing a report drawn up on the day of the incident. The court described the practice of firing at the engine of a moving vessel as “extremely dangerous” given the precision needed. “In consequence, the 13 gunshots necessarily posed a risk to the motorboat’s passengers,” it noted.
Two Syrians on the boat were seriously injured; one had been struck in the shoulder and the other, Tello, was shot in the head. A court in Greece later convicted two Turkish nationals on charges of people smuggling in relation to the incident.
Tello remained in a Greek hospital for six months. He was later moved to Sweden, where his wife and children were living, where he continued to receive treatment. He died in December 2015.
An investigation by Greek authorities included “numerous shortcomings … which had rendered the investigation inadequate”, the court said.
As such, Greece had failed to show that the use of force had been “absolutely necessary”, it said. The ruling described the level of force used as “clearly disproportionate”.
The court’s decision was welcomed by Refugee Support Aegean, one of the groups that helped to file the legal challenge. The case “demonstrates yet again well-documented, systemic deficiencies in the planning and implementation of coastguard operations and in the investigation of human rights violations at sea”, it said."

In March last year, Douglas Brodie, famous for his emails to the Members of the Scottish Parliament (“MSPs”) downed tools “barring a future bad turn of public events for the much worse.”
As it turned out, a year later he has been given the opportunity to contact his MSP.
What has prompted Brodies latest email is an invitation to attend a ‘Let’s Talk Energy Summit’. Brodie has declined to attend this “depressing event” but took the opportunity to tell Sir Edward Mountain, MSP for the Highlands and Islands, why the net zero policies are disastrous.
“We should scrap net zero, including its suspiciously anti-humanity evolution into a war on farming,” Brodie said.
“Pursuing astronomically-expensive net zero is certain to lead to stunted economic growth, impoverishment and deindustrialisation. Net zero-provoked industrial tragedies … together with ongoing degradations to and malinvestments in our energy infrastructure are reducing the UK to being an insecure basket case.”

The following is an email from Douglas Brodie to Mr. Innes Munro, Constituency Assistant to Sir Edward Mountain MSP, Sir Edward Mountain MSP, Douglas Ross MSP/MP, Reform UK
My Net Zero climate change broadside
Thank you for your invitation to apply for a place at Sir Edward Mountain’s forthcoming ‘Let’s Talk Energy Summit’:
… the chance to share your views on Energy in the Highlands and discuss these with a diverse panel of industry professionals from the hydrogen sector, representatives relative to pylons and substations, boiler efficiency and household energy specialists, and Edward Mountain MSP.
I will pass on going to this depressing event. On the plus side, it has given me the pretext and motivation to write this anti-net zero broadside which I hope will be conveyed far and wide. The title mimics my net zero climate change rant of 18 long months ago.
I have given my views on the futility of the UK’s misguided net zero energy policies to Sir Edward (Conservative MSP head of the Holyrood Net Zero Committee) many times previously, e.g. HERE, HERE and HERE. He always chose to fob me off rather than give any written answer to my points.
The gist of my prior emails is that the man-made global warming hypothesis is a decades-old hoax and that it is pointless for the UK to self-harm by striving to reduce CO2 emissions, never mind trying to eliminate them completely and especially not unilaterally when the non-Western world is not paying a blind bit of notice to the West’s “climate change” ideology, bar humouring lip service.
My response to contrived alarmist pleading such as “2023 was the hottest in 125,000 years” consists of two words which will be alien to many people, two words which give smoking gun proof that the campaign against alleged man-made global warming (aka “climate change”) is a deceitful conspiracy: Hunga Tonga. All the world can now see that meteorological authorities (e.g. the UK Met Office), the corporate media and social media, politicians, COP28 activists and non-governmental organisations have conspired to suppress all news and views going against the man-made global warming narrative regarding the climatic impact of the 2022 Hunga Tonga undersea volcanic eruption which spewed massive quantities of water vapour, the most powerful greenhouse gas, high into the stratosphere to cause a huge spike in global temperature.
They obviously did this in order to continue their puerile pretence that every rise in global temperatures is due to man-made CO2 emissions, no matter the true cause. Between the periodic transient spikes of natural El Nino warming in the years prior to the unprecedented Hunga Tonga spike, global temperatures have been hovering close to where they were some 25 years ago despite all the dire predictions – a meteorologically stable situation (discounting the non-CO2 effects) which net zero proponents fraudulently describe as a “climate emergency.”
A search for “Hunga Tonga” on green billionaire-bribed BBC News yields zilch of relevance. They especially want to suppress Hunga Tonga because it confirmed that water vapour is a much more potent global warming agent than CO2. The fatal flaw in the Mickey Mouse scaremongering put out by these globalist conspirators is that it is so easily seen through. According to the UN IPCC’s disputed climate modelling, CO2-forced global warming is supposed to happen at a slow but steady rate of about 0.2°C per decade, not as a sudden jump of 0.9°C in 10 months as happened in 2023, with a minor assist from a relatively weak, now waning El Nino.
My colleague Jaime Jessop has documented this Hunga Tonga chicanery in her ‘Hunga Games’ and follow-up posts, as has the indefatigable Paul Homewood. Once the Hunga Tonga atmospheric water vapour dissipates, I predict that the global temperature spike will subside into continued flatlining (bar natural ENSO events) followed by a resumption of the global cooling trend which apparently started in 2016, mapping neatly onto the studiously-ignored regular AMO cycle which caused the global cooling scare of the 1960s-70s.
As to the futile “solutions” to the non-problem of “climate change,” technologies like wind power, green hydrogen and carbon capture and storage are hopelessly impractical, ruinously expensive and unsustainable. These pointless malinvestments are being exploited by grifters to make an opportunist profit on the back of false establishment propaganda and never-justified subsidies which have to be paid for by long-suffering, hard-pressed tax-payers, businesses and households.
Sir Edward should instead be seeking to reduce our ever-soaring energy costs and avoid the grid blackouts which are looming because of his disastrous net zero policies. The UK came close to minor blackouts last cold, dark, windless December as documented in THIS post by Jaime Jessop. Far more important are the major blackouts which are guaranteed in the future by our suicidal reliance on weather-dependent renewables and the running down of our essential fossil fuel and nuclear electricity generation capabilities.
The recent T4 electricity supply auction for 2027-28 revealed an almost total failure to secure any new-build CGCT or other large-scale generation, unsurprising given the insane Con/Lab/Lib/SNP Uniparty plans to shut down all fossil fuel electricity generation. These Uniparty politicians are criminally irresponsible in having no credible electricity supply backup plan for when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine, other than severe rationing (smart meters to the fore). Their “crimes against thermodynamics” net zero plans are eviscerated in THIS post by energy analyst David Turver, and THIS.
Even the climate change fanatics of the bought-and-paid-for Daily Telegraph are backtracking, with Jeremy Warner admitting that unilateral net zero is pointless and Matthew Lynn saying that (non-paywalled copy) “net zero … is crushing the life out of the economy”. The days of net zero are surely numbered, as exemplified by the catalogue of failures in THIS net zero samizdat and THIS.
Instead of the mis-labelled “green” technologies being pushed by Sir Edward and his colleagues, we should be encouraging domestic fracking and the full exploitation of North Sea oil and gas resources, vigorously developing nuclear power and removing all the net zero constraints on fossil fuel energy use, including clean coal. In short, we should scrap net zero (new petition), as pledged by the Reform Party, including its suspiciously anti-humanity evolution into a war on farming.
Pursuing astronomically-expensive net zero is certain to lead to stunted economic growth, impoverishment and deindustrialisation. Net zero-provoked industrial tragedies such as the pending shutdown of the Port Talbot blast furnaces and the Grangemouth oil refinery together with ongoing degradations to and malinvestments in our energy infrastructure are reducing the UK to being an insecure basket case, all for the fatuous purpose of offshoring our CO2 emissions.
For years I thought that our politicians were too non-technical to understand these engineering issues. I now believe that impoverishment and deindustrialisation has been their deliberate plan all along, or at least the plan they are following like subservient puppets (or unthinking muppets) at the bidding of their psychopathic globalist overlords who believe that “the real enemy, then, is humanity itself” (Club of Rome). I have never seen any credible rebuttal of this opinion (they would say conspiracy theory), which coincides suspiciously with the hardships and malfeasances inflicted on the people by the deep state’s globally-coordinated, Uniparty-complicit, unlawful, malign, destructive, easily seen through, no worse than flu covid-19 “plandemic”.
Maybe the reason why an unusually high number of MPs have already announced they are standing down at the next general election (95 to date) is because many have belatedly realised they are being used as pawns in globalist conspiracies to commit crimes against humanity. It’s high time for someone in authority to stand up and come clean. Sadly, that is unlikely to happen because they are in too deep, HERE taunted in parliament on crimes against humanity.
For years the incumbent UK Uniparty political class (Con/Lab/Lib/SNP) has shown deep hostility to the electorate they are supposed to serve. It doesn’t matter which party is in power as they all back the same self-harming, never-endorsed globalist policies like UN IPCC net zero, UN Agenda 2030, WHO-controlled “pandemic” preparedness and IOM-facilitated immigration. It is no longer so-called right versus left that should matter to the electorate, it should be freedom versus 1984-style totalitarianism.
In THIS 3-minute video, Neil Oliver senses that the long-simmering anger of the people against being abused on multiple fronts is coming to the boil and that our unrepentant oppressors are belatedly getting nervous of the storm which could be coming. He continues in the same vein in his latest monologue, ripping into WEF Davos placeman Rishi Sunak and lambasting our useless Uniparty politicians and their globalist controllers. The best hope for the future may be that people stop voting for the lying, treasonous Uniparty, before they try to lock us into their ulterior goal of tyrannical one-world governance.

Millions of people die as a direct result of bacterial infections — especially when the bacteria have developed a resistance to the antibiotics we use to treat them. It's this drug resistance that makes them particularly deadly.
And the latest data is not encouraging. The emergence of several drug-resistant bacteria species is proving a serious problem for health systems around the world, especially for low-and-middle income countries.
It's estimated that bacterial antimicrobial resistance was directly responsible for 1.27 million global deaths in 2019, and could be associated with as many as 4.95 million deaths, according to the the World Health Organization (WHO).
Priority drug-resistant bacteria which can cause serious illness include mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that causes tuberculosis, and high-burden resistant pathogens such as Salmonella, Shigella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus.
Difference between antibiotic resistance and antimicrobial resistance
In this article, we'll focus on antibiotic resistance. But more broadly, you may have heard the term antimicrobial resistance (AMR).
AMR refers to all kinds of microbes — tiny living things, or organisms — including bacteria but also parasites, viruses and fungi, which have adapted to resist common medical treatments.
Put simply: the drugs don't work as well as they used to, and we're struggling to find new ones to treat illnesses. Even common ones like urinary tract infections (UTIs) can turn fatal when left untreated.
How the World Health Organization ranks bacteria as dangerous
The WHO monitors and ranks bacteria according to various data:
- Mortality rates
- Incidence (number of infections)
- Non-fatal health burden
- Trend of resistance
- Transmissibility
- Preventability
- Treatability
- Pipeline (new drugs in development)
The bacteria get a score for each metric and then get ranked. The 2024 list features two dozen priority pathogens. Here are the top eight.
Top 8 bacterial pathogens
1. Klebsiella pneumoniae
Klebsiella is a type of bacteria found in the intestines and human feces. Klebsiella pneumoniae can cause pneumonia, bloodstream infections, wound or surgical site infections and meningitis if it gets into the nervous system.
Klebsiella pneumoniae can become a so-called ""superbug"" in hospitals, spreading fast and becoming resistant to most available drug treatments.
It is specifically resistant to carbapenem, an ""antibiotic of last resort"" — it's used when all other treatments for multidrug-resistant pathogens have failed. Klebsiella pneumoniae is also resistant to a third-generation antibiotic called cephalosporin.
2. Escherichia coli (E. coli)
As with klebsiella bacteria, Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria are usually found in the intestines of human and non-human animals. They are also found in the environment, food and water.
Most kinds of E. coli are harmless, but some can cause illnesses, including diarrhea, urinary tract infections, pneumonia and sepsis. E.Coli concentrations in Paris' Seine River came under scrutiny during the 2024 Summer Olympics in France.
E. coli is resistant to third-generation cephalosporin — a commonly prescribed antibiotic, which is also used to treat sexually transmitted infections, such as gonorrhea. E. coli is also resistant to carbapenem.
3. Acinetobacter baumannii
Back in 2012, researchers described Acinetobacter baumannii as an ""emerging opportunistic bacterial pathogen"" associated with hospital-acquired infections (HAIs).
Long-term hospital patients with a compromised immune system, or those in hospital for more than 90 days, were identified as having a high risk of contracting an infection. Acinetobacter baumannii is carbapenem-resistant.
4. Mycobacterium tuberculosis
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) causes tuberculosis, a potentially fatal, bacterial infection of the lungs.
TB killed 1.25 million people, including 161,000 people with HIV, in 2023.
The WHO said ""TB has probably returned to being the world's leading cause of death from a single infectious agent, following three years in which it was replaced by coronavirus disease (COVID-19).""
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is resistant to rifampicin — an antibiotic used to treat mycobacterial infections, like TB and leprosy, or M. leprae.
5. Salmonella Typhi
Salmonella Typhi causes typhoid fever, a life-threatening illness. It mostly affects people living in regions with poor sanitation and unsafe water and food sources — such as parts of Asia, Africa and Latin America.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there are about 9 million cases of typhoid worldwide every year. Salmonella Typhi is resistant to flouroquinolone — a broad-spectrum antibiotic, with a range of side effects, which have led the European Medicines Agency to restrict its use.
6. Shigella species
There are four species of Shigella: Shigella sonnei, Shigella flexneri, Shigella boydii, Shigella dysenteriae. Shigella bacteria cause diarrhea, stomach pain and fever.
They spread via contaminated food and water, but also during sexual activity with a sick person. They are fluoroquinolone-resistant.
Shigella species that are resistant to almost all antimicrobial classes are increasing in prevalence and becoming globally dominant. The greatest burden of disease is in low- and middle-income countries with poor sanitation.
7. Enterococcus faecium
Enterococcus faecium lives in the gut flora, also known as microbiome. It can lead to serious illness for people with diabetes or a chronic kidney condition.
Enterococcus, can cause infections such as UTIs and infections of the nervous system, if it enters parts of the body outside the gut.
Enterococcus are resistant to vancomycin — an antibiotic, which is also used to treat infections caused by staphylococci bacteria, which is also drug-resistant.
8. Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Pseudomonas aeruginosa leads to infections in the blood, lungs, urinary tract and other parts of the body, often after surgery in hospitals. Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria are multidrug-resistant (MDR), including the common antibiotic, carbapenems.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections carry specific risks in immunocompromised patients. Despite being moved from ""critical"" to ""high"" priority, it remains a significant concern due to its drug resistance profile.

Transhumanism: Capital-Driven Colonisation of the Living
Jennifer Bilek is a contemporary artist [1] and journalist who has led the way in challenging the transhumanist agenda being promoted by the global system.
Typically for an organic radical thinker, she finds no place for herself in the usual “political” categories used to restrict our understanding.
As she explains on her 11th Hour blog: “I have been on the left side of politics all my life, until now, where I find myself in a political wilderness, with no political home”. [2]
She recounts in a May 2024 interview that she grew her “sea legs” as a journalist during the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement in New York. [3]
Bilek wrote in 2018: “As an environmental activist who was de-platformed from a speaking venue by transactivists, in 2013 I developed curiosity about the power of this group to force this development”. [4]
She said that a year later, when Time magazine announced a transgender tipping point on its cover, she had already begun to examine the money behind the transgender industry.
Her conclusion, after years of detailed research, is that “transgender” is not a type of person but a conglomerate of political and corporate pressure, grooming the next generation for industrial body dissociation.
Synthetic sex identities manifested by elites in the medical-technology industry are conditioning the public to accept radical changes to human biology and our perceptions of ourselves as a species.
We are witnessing “a political coup of mammoth proportion” [5] staged by “an organised technological, religious cult with eugenicist underpinnings” [6] which is very closely linked to the biotech industry. [7]
The sudden and ubiquitous presence of the trans industry in our society is a major red flag, observes Bilek.
“When governments, across the Western world, international corporations, the largest international law firms, banks, religious organisations, educational institutions, right down to children’s grade schools, all adopt the same narrative, that contradicts what we know about something so fundamental to our biological reality, as our sexual reproduction, and our position within the natural world, you have to realise that something is very wrong”. [8]
The pursuit of profit inevitably plays a key role in the manufacture of this corporate-backed pseudo-movement, with gender ideology initiated by wealthy, influential individuals, families and banks. [9]
She notes in an article introducing her 2024 book of collected essays, ‘Transsexual Transgender Transhuman’: “The surrogacy and technological reproduction markets are already generating billions of dollars in steadily growing revenues. Collectively, they are projected to reach into the hundreds of billions by 2032”. [10]
Bilek’s work has involved identifying and exposing a number of the extremely rich families and individuals behind the gender industry.
She remarks that no one is more important than Martine Rothblatt, [11] a transsexual, transhumanist lawyer and entrepreneur, who authored the first “gender bill” in the USA and “writes and speaks often about ‘transgenderism’ fertilising the ground for transhumanism.” [12]
In August 2022 she exposed the dubious activities of the Pritzkers, one of the wealthiest families in America, namely “their plight to engineer the normalisation of synthetic sex identities through funding of our medical, legal, cultural, military, educational, and other institutions.” [13]
Bilek reveals: “Yale University has been privy to a windfall of Pritzker cash and, subsequently, the creation of a growing programme in manufacturing synthetic sex.
“The psychiatric community has been bought off by huge cash dumps from billionaires invested in the techno-medical and biotech industries, driving a religious cult through the media and all our institutions.”
A key element in this cult is the way in which the “left” has been fooled into cheerleading its tyrannical advance, thanks to “corporate marketing of the ideology as progressive.” [14]
This is particularly true of the current incarnation of the LGBTQ+ network, which is “working closely with the techno-medical complex, big banks, international law firms, pharma giants, and corporate power to solidify the idea that humans are not a sexually dimorphic species.” [15]
“LGB signals human rights. The supporting characters, T+, work to obscure the industry and technology behind the façade of human rights.” [16]
“Most people don’t realise how big, Big Pharma is, and that it is a global system. It is estimated by some to be bigger than the military. Big Pharma and Big Tech are operating this agenda and using the LGB human rights movement as both a cover and the site at which technology is usurping reproduction and human sexuality.” [17]
This “progressive” positioning of the industry has meant that attacks on Bilek have not come directly from the business interests she criticises, but from their proxies on the pro-trans left.
For instance, a 2023 smear piece on a left-wing French website absurdly claimed that Bilek’s opposition to the gender industry meant she had joined the “extreme right.” [18]
And the UK’s Freedom News, once an anarchist publication, announced that she was “a source of growing anti-semitic conspiracy theories.” [19]
Her decade of investigative journalism was dismissed as “a complexly developed conspiracy theory of a secret plan by Jewish billionaires to use ‘transgenderism’ as a plot to bring about a transhumanist immortality project and enslave humanity through technocapital.”
It turns out that this article was originally produced by an organisation linked to Big Pharma’s Wellcome Foundation; impact capitalism; Jewish “philanthropy” and Vanguard, a pillar of the Rothschilds’ global financial empire. [20]
Bilek has written of “the most extreme form of gaslighting I have ever seen perpetrated against the human population,” [21] and when asked in an interview why she thought there was such an effort to disallow and censor views like hers, she replied: “Profit and power. It really is that simple.” [22]
Bilek has been a source of inspiration for fellow orgrad [Organic Radicals] thinker Silvia Guerini [23] and she, in return, has praised her Italian allies’ activism against the bio-tech industry. [24]
Like Guerini, and indeed Alexis Escudero, Bilek has warned of the alarming prospect of a future world without mothers.
“We are currently still a sexually dimorphic species but with research into ectogenesis, creating embryos in a dish, and large and small gametes from skin cells, there may come a time when we don’t ever need to copulate to reproduce and women will no longer gestate the species.” [25]
“The whole thrust of this agenda is really to move human reproduction to the tech sector.” [26]
“Reproductive sex is being deconstructed for the market: eggs, cervixes, hormones, breasts, wombs, etc. It is why women are being reduced to terms like chest feeders, birthing bodies, cervix havers, etc.” [27]
And, again alongside Guerini, she is concerned about the use of children to push through this assault on the natural life processes.
She writes: “Children are being groomed for this future. They are being indoctrinated in schools to the idea they can choose their sex and to see themselves as compartmentalised mix-and-match parts, vs whole biological systems attached to and sustained by the natural world.
“They are being taught about reproductive technologies and surrogacy in grade school, that some families are created via technology.
“They are being taught that they can transcend their human bodies and that sexuality is a smorgasbord of acts, having nothing to do with reproduction or intimate bonding, and they are being sexually traumatised into a state of dissociation.” [28]
The aim is “to create malleability in the next generation”, says Bilek, [29] and to “unmoor humanity from the biosphere and acclimate us to a more intimate connection with technology.” [30]
This is an incredibly dangerous process, she points out: “Once we open the door to accepting vast changes to human biology, that undermine the very definition of what it means to be human as a sexually dimorphic species, we have opened up a Pandora’s box for melding humans with technology and AI.” [31]
“We have reached the 11th hour. We need to decide if we will let go of our humanity in exchange for an elusive, illusive idea of a techno-utopia where we won’t die and we can cure, have and be everything we desire with technology – or, will we cleave to what is left of our humanity as technophilic elites invested in pharma, tech, AI, gene splicing, organ transplants, and genetic modifications that take us well beyond the realm of human, fight to extract it from us through the process of capital-driven colonization.” [32]
We face the real danger of being separated from the natural living world in favour of a “roboticised, virtual existence”. [33] This is “an issue of reality versus anti-reality.” [34]
The transhumanist mission to merge human beings with technology will lead to us being “changed forever” if we do not wake up fast, she says. [35]
“Transhumanism is the single most important thing to resist if we are to stop the deconstruction of our species.”
More than that, a big change of direction is needed for humankind, insists Bilek: “We must divest from tech and reinvest in the natural world, or we are just forestalling our inevitable destruction.” [36]

A narrative is being pushed that going onto a plant-based diet is not only best for the planet but better for our own wellbeing. While the narrative has helped to enrich vegan food companies, it is harming people’s health.
Accumulating studies are suggesting that the metabolic benefits of going vegan are accompanied by a plethora of health risks stemming from the diet’s inherent restrictions which involves avoiding all animal products. Concerns range from a heightened risk of diseases relating to the skeletal and nervous systems, to conditions such as haemorrhagic stroke.
The best approach to a healthy diet is to combine the main benefits of a vegan diet (i.e. the high intake of fruits and vegetables) with a certain amount of protein through meat, fish and eggs.
Let’s not lose touch…Your Government and Big Tech are actively trying to censor the information reported by The Exposé to serve their own needs. Subscribe now to make sure you receive the latest uncensored news in your inbox…
The dangers of veganism
The following was written by David Cox and originally published by The Telegraph on 8 September 2024.
The vegan diet is often described in the context of its benefits for weight loss and heart health. Cult documentaries such as Netflix’s The Game Changers have helped push a narrative that going plant-based is not only best for the planet, but better for our own wellbeing.
There are currently an estimated 2.5 million vegans in the UK, a figure which has nearly doubled in the past 12 months alone. This has helped to greatly enrich vegan food companies, with the UK market for meat substitutes worth more than £800 million, making it the second largest in Europe, behind Germany.
Yet at the same time, accumulating studies are suggesting that the metabolic benefits of going vegan are accompanied by a plethora of health risks stemming from the diet’s inherent restrictions which involves avoiding all animal products including meat, fish, seafood, eggs, dairy, and honey. The emerging concerns range from a heightened risk of diseases relating to the skeletal and nervous systems, to conditions such as haemorrhagic stroke.
“We’re basically not designed to be vegans,” says Dr Geoff Mullan, a functional medicine practitioner. “There’s some big macronutrients and micronutrients missing if you’re just eating a vegan diet. You can get plenty of proteins on a vegan diet, but there is a concern that you’re not getting enough of the right type of protein. Plant-based proteins are not the same as animal-based proteins or dairy, and our body doesn’t process them in the same way.”
Even some of the diet’s biggest celebrity advocates have ultimately returned to an omnivorous life after tiring of the restrictive nature of being vegan, combined with some worrying health concerns. Miley Cyrus told Joe Rogan’s podcast: “I was vegan for a very long time, and I’ve had to introduce fish and omegas into my life because my brain wasn’t functioning properly. Now I’m so much sharper than I was and I think that I was, at one point, pretty malnutritioned.
Anne Hathaway also described that she “just didn’t feel good or healthy” while on a vegan diet and recalled that after eating a piece of salmon after several years as a vegan, “my brain felt like a computer rebooting”.
So why can going vegan lead to health concerns and what do nutritional scientists think?
The health risks
While dietary protein can be sourced from plants, plant proteins are not only 50-70 per cent less digestible than animal proteins, but according to the World Health Organisation, animal proteins are regarded as complete protein, meaning they have higher biological value.
One recent study examined the adequacy of a vegan diet in terms of macronutrients through surveying the nutritional intake of vegans across Europe, finding that vegans consumed the least total protein.
Clare Collins, a professor of nutrition and dietetics at the University of Newcastle in New South Wales, Australia, says that problems can arise when people end up starting a vegan or even a vegetarian diet as something of a fad, and thus fail to ensure that what they’re eating meets all their nutrient requirements.
“I think the main danger is whether you’re truly committed to that, or whether it’s just this week I’m a vegan, I’m going to do that for a few months,” she says.
One of the most well-known risks is vitamin B12 deficiency, something which has been linked to neurological problems and blood disorders. Vitamin B12 is found in foods such as meat, poultry and eggs. Other studies have suggested that inadequate vitamin B12 consumption may even raise the risk of cancers, with some epidemiologists finding that postmenopausal female patients with low vitamin B12 levels have a heightened risk of breast cancer. Reduced vitamin B12 levels have also been linked to risk of developing cancerous growths in the cervix and gastrointestinal tract.
While vitamin B12 supplementation is known as being imperative for vegans, Dr Mullan says that most of the vegans he sees in his practice tend to have lower than optimal vitamin B12 and iron levels as well as being deficient in another crucial nutrient, omega-3. Omega-3s are vital for brain health and function as they are concentrated in particularly high levels in brain cells.
“We do quite a lot of blood testing and when I see a blood panel I can always tell that it’s a vegan straight away because the lipid [blood fat] profiles are normally really good, but vitamin B12 and iron levels are always in their boots,” says Dr Mullan. “And their omega-3s are always really bad.”
Dr Mullan explains this is because omega-3s exist in two forms. We typically get so-called long-chain omega-3s such as EPA and DHA from eating fatty fish or omega-3 enriched eggs. However, the omega-3s found in plant-only sources such as chia and flax seeds are shorter-chain omega-3s, which we struggle to process as effectively.
“At best, only somewhere between 5 and 10 per cent of short-chain omega-3s can get converted to a form we can actually use,” says Dr Mullan.
It’s bad for your bones
While consuming calcium-rich vegetables such as kale and broccoli can protect bones, two of the biggest population studies that have monitored vegans over time – one which followed Seventh Day Adventists in the United States and Canada, and the EPIC-Oxford study which tracked the health of around 65,000 meat-eaters, vegetarians and vegans across the UK – have indicated that many vegans don’t actually meet their calcium requirements. As a result, the risk of hip fracture, leg fractures and general bone fractures, has been found to be higher in vegans compared with meat eaters.
Much of this is thought to be because calcium is less easily absorbed from plant foods compared to dairy products, while various studies have also shown that vegans consume insufficient vitamin D which exacerbates calcium shortages.
“Long-term observational studies of vegans find adverse effects on bone density that is probably caused by very low calcium and marginally adequate protein intakes,” says Thomas Sanders, an honorary professor of nutritional sciences at King’s College London. “Although vegan diets may have favourable effects on health in middle-age such as a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes, this is not the case in older vegans who seem more likely to suffer from muscle loss, low bone density and neurological disorders which have a significant impact on the quality of life.”
Greater stroke risk
One particularly alarming finding from the EPIC-Oxford study was that vegetarians and vegans had a 20 per cent greater risk of stroke compared with meat eaters.
This finding has been corroborated by several studies in Japan, suggesting that individuals with a very low intake of animal products have an increased risk of stroke and that key animal-derived nutrients such as vitamin B12, essential amino acids and long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have a protective effect against stroke.
Pregnancy complications
Earlier this year a small study conducted by researchers in Denmark suggested that vegan mothers may have a poorer prenatal nutritional status, which can lead to worse outcomes for the foetus and baby.
In particular, the mothers were found to be at a greater risk of preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication that causes dangerously high blood pressure levels, while their babies had a lower birth weight compared to those of omnivores.
Dr Duane Mellor, a registered dietitian, points out that while the study was small and only monitored 18 vegans, the challenges of ensuring that a vegan diet is nutritionally complete can have health consequences. “There can be risks of lower intakes of iron, iodine and vitamins B12 and D which can affect the health of both the mother, along with the development of the baby,” says Dr Mellor.
Depression and mental health
A general concern with restrictive diets is that they can lead to disordered eating habits, and be reflective of a condition called orthorexia nervosa, which is defined as a fixation on health-conscious eating behaviour. This involves obsessive food decisions, self-imposed anxiety, self-punishment, and ritual activities surrounding food preparations. Research has found that both vegetarians and vegans, particularly women, are more prone to orthorexia nervosa.
Some vegans who have subsequently switched back to an omnivorous diet have complained of low energy levels while following a vegan diet. Like Cyrus, her partner at the time, Liam Hemsworth described feeling “low and lethargic” while on the diet.
One scientific review from researchers at King’s College London and the University of Nicosia in Cyprus found 11 studies which suggested that vegetarian or vegan diets are linked to higher rates of depression, potentially due to deficiencies in omega-3 and vitamin B12. Reduced concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids in the brain can cause significant changes in brain function, including changes in neuron size, learning and memory, while both omega-3 and vitamin B12 are involved in the transmission of key brain chemicals.
“There’s also iodine which is essential for making thyroid hormones, which are essential for energy and mental health,” says Dr Mullan. “Iodine is one of the most common deficiencies in vegans because it’s very difficult to get it from plant sources, unless you’re eating lots of seaweed.”
The risks for kids
Generation Z are particularly at the forefront of the shift to a plant-based diet. Back in 2021, 8 per cent of British children were identifying as vegan and 13 per cent as vegetarian, and now some surveys have suggested that more than half of Gen Zers may be choosing to follow a meat-free diet by 2025.
However, there are particular concerns about the consequences of a lack of animal protein in children, such as inhibited growth, lower bone mineral content and density, and poorer developmental outcomes. A review from scientists at UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health found that nearly a third of vegetarian and vegan children do not take vitamin B12 supplements, resulting in deficiencies combined with lower iron stores, greater risk of vitamin D deficiency and inadequate iodine intake.
The issues with vegan meats
Another issue with the shift towards plant-based diets is that many shop-bought plant-based meat or dairy alternatives are ultra-processed foods. Richard Hoffman, a researcher at the University of Hertfordshire, says that rather than being made with ingredients such as lentils, plant-based meats tend to be manufactured with highly refined chemicals, combined with ingredients such as emulsifiers and stabilisers.
“Plant-based meats really should be called fake meats, because they’re designed to mimic meat without actually containing anything resembling meat,” he says. “All these companies are doing their best to get the product to be indistinguishable from meat, but to do that, they have to use all these highly refined ingredients.”
You don’t need to go full carnivore
Ultimately, Dr Mullan says that the best approach is to combine the main benefits of a vegan diet (ie the high intake of fruits and vegetables) with a certain amount of protein through meat, fish and eggs.
“I always say, the majority of your diet should be like a vegan diet with that higher vegetable intake, but adding in eggs, fish and occasionally red meat,” he says.

3408,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-08-21,"Florida quietly removes LGBTQ+ travel info from state website
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Key West, Fort Lauderdale, Wilton Manors and St. Petersburg are among several Florida cities that have long been top U.S. destinations for LGBTQ+ tourists. So it came as a surprise this week when travelers learned that Florida’s tourism marketing agency quietly removed the “LGBTQ Travel” section from its website sometime in the past few months.
Business owners who cater to Florida’s LGBTQ+ tourists said Wednesday that it marked the latest attempt by officials in the state to erase the LGBTQ+ community. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis previously championed a bill to forbid classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity, and supported a ban on gender-affirming care for minors, as well as a law meant to keep children out of drag shows.
“It’s just disgusting to see this,” said Keith Blackburn, who heads the Greater Fort Lauderdale LGBT Chamber of Commerce. “They seem to want to erase us.”
The change to Visit Florida’s website was first reported by NBC News, which noted a search query still pulls up some listings for LGBTQ+-friendly places despite the elimination of the section.
John Lai, who chairs Visit Florida’s board, didn’t respond to an email seeking comment Tuesday. Dana Young, Visit Florida’s CEO and president, didn’t respond to a voicemail message Wednesday, and neither did the agency’s public relations director.
Visit Florida is a public-private partnership between the state of Florida and the state’s tourism industry. The state contributes about $50 million each year to the quasi-public agency from two tourism and economic development funds.
Florida is one of the most popular states in the U.S. for tourists, and tourism is one of its biggest industries. Nearly 141 million tourists visited Florida in 2023, with out-of-state visitors contributing more than $102 billion to Florida’s economy.
Before the change, the LGBTQ+ section on Visit Florida’s website had read, “There’s a sense of freedom to Florida’s beaches, the warm weather and the myriad activities — a draw for people of all orientations, but especially appealing to a gay community looking for a sense of belonging and acceptance.”
Blackburn said the change and other anti-LGBTQ+ policies out of Tallahassee make it more difficult for him to promote South Florida tourism since he encounters prospective travelers or travel promoters who say they don’t want to do business in the state.
Last year, for instance, several civil rights groups issued a travel advisory for Florida, saying that policies championed by DeSantis and Florida lawmakers are “openly hostile toward African Americans, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals.”
But visitors should also understand that many Florida cities are extremely inclusive, with gay elected officials and LGBTQ+-owned businesses, and they don’t reflect the policies coming from state government, Blackburn added.
“It’s difficult when these kinds of stories come out, and the state does these things, and we hear people calling for a boycott,” Blackburn said. “On one level, it’s embarrassing to have to explain why people should come to South Florida and our destination when the state is doing these things.”"

COVID-19 is caused by exposure to a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Learn more about PolitiFact’s fact-checking process and rating system.
COVID-19 is a viral infection spread through contact with an infected person. It is not caused by radiation poisoning, as one social media post claimed.
An Instagram video shows a person talking about illnesses’ root causes. The video‘s background shows a graphic that says COVID-19’s ""root cause"" is radiation poisoning.
""2020,"" the man says in the video. ""Remember that whole thing? Radiation poisoning. Loss of smell, loss of taste, loss of hair, nausea, symptoms of radio wave sickness.""
This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.)
COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV–2 coronavirus according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
It is spread through close contact with an infected person when small respiratory particles are passed between people, the World Health Organization says. The CDC says people can sometimes contract COVID-19 through droplets on contaminated surfaces that they touch.
The first four cases of COVID-19 were reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, when a local hospital identified ""pneumonia of an unknown etiology."" In January 2020, COVID-19’s complete viral genetic sequence was released to some public health organizations, the CDC Museum COVID-19 Timeline shows.
The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection issued a statement in 2020 that electromagnetic field exposure ""does not cause COVID-19, nor does it have any effect on the disease process or health outcomes of those who are infected by the new corona virus.""
In 2021, we rated False a claim that connected radiation from wireless technologies with COVID-19. That post referred to a research paper, but the paper’s authors wrote that ""none of the observations discussed here prove this linkage.""
According to the Mayo Clinic, exposure to a high dose of radiation causes radiation poisoning. It is rare and most cases occurred after nuclear industrial accidents such as the explosion of the nuclear power plant in Chernobyl, Ukraine. Radiation poisoning symptoms include nausea and vomiting, hair loss, fever, diarrhea, headache, weakness and fatigue.
The CDC lists COVID-19’s symptoms as fatigue, fever, diarrhea, headache, nausea or vomiting, new loss of taste or smell and sore throat.
Although some COVID-19 symptoms are also symptoms of radiation poisoning, they are not connected.
We rate the claim that COVID-19 is caused by radiation poisoning False.

2691,fake,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-01-31,"Leftist media outlets have really outdone themselves trying to convince Americans that the climate apocalypse is imminent.
Several legacy media outlets jumped on an opportunity to make ridiculous claims about the supposed threat of “climate disasters” using the insane “Doomsday Clock” analogy. USA Today, CNN and The Washington Post each claimed that there are “90 seconds to midnight” on the Doomsday Clock – meaning the world is reportedly the closest it has ever been to the “theoretical point of annihilation.” The outlets absurdly warned that the impending doom is in part due to climate change.
Of all of the leftist media outlets, USA Today took the cake for the most blatant pandering. The outlet published an op-ed piece pushing for absurd climate action by making climate change as important as international wars. The Jan. 23 piece, written by the president of the Bulletin of Atomic Sciences and Doomsday Clock boss Rachel Bronson, complained about oil production, claiming that “we need to move even faster” to enact extreme climate agendas.
In yet another case of extreme climate fear-mongering, CNN claimed on Jan. 23 that the clock was meant to “gauge how close humanity is to destroying the world” and “spark conversations about difficult scientific topics such as climate change,” as well as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza..CNN, like USA Today, also quoted Bronson who said that the “lack of action on climate change threatens billions of lives and livelihoods” because of “climate related disasters.”
The Washington Post followed a similar path in its own piece about the metaphorical clock. On Jan. 24, The Post lumped in an alleged “spiraling climate crisis” with the current wars in Gaza and Ukraine as “threats continuing to put human existence under pressure.”. Also like CNN, The Post peddled crazy eco-extremist talking points about climate disasters to justify the clock’s heavy consideration of climate change.
To make matters worse, the Doomsday Clock has a very biased history. The Bulletin of Atomic Sciences has included climate change as one of the risk factors considered in its doomsday estimations since 2007, according to Reuters. Bronson, along with other supporters of the Doomsday Clock climate agenda, donated much more to Democrats than to Republicans, according to research conducted by MRC Business in 2018. It’s clear what they really believe and support.

TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — A bill in Belarus that would outlaw the promotion of homosexuality and other behavior is set to land on lawmakers’ desks amid an unwavering crackdown on dissent initiated by authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko in 2020.
Prosecutor General Andrei Shved said Thursday the proposed legislation establishes administrative liability for anyone promoting “abnormal relationships, pedophilia (and) voluntary refusal to have children.” He didn’t elaborate or discuss what the potential punishments would be for breaking the law.
The bill will be submitted to the Belarusian parliament, which is under the strict control of Lukashenko.
“The activities of opponents who are trying to destroy traditional family values, and therefore morality and statehood, are generally aimed at destroying Belarus as a country,” Shved said on Belarusian television, warning that it was necessary to “prevent even discussion” of such topics.
He added that it would be necessary to carry out “broad ideological and explanatory work, including in schools.”
Homosexuality was decriminalized in Belarus in 1994, but the country does not recognize same-sex marriage. However, in the deeply conservative and predominantly Orthodox country, there are no anti-discrimination measures in place to protect the rights of the LGBTQ+ community.
Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron fist for the past three decades, is an open critic of homosexuality, and has declared publicly that “it is better to be a dictator than to be gay.”
Human rights organizations in Belarus report pressure on LGBTQ+ people from the KGB state security service, which recruits members of the community by blackmailing them with the threat of making their sexual orientation public.
Activists say LGBTQ+ people in Belarus continue to face stigma in society and note high rates of suicide among the community, in part because professional psychological care is generally unavailable.
In 2023, independent gay rights group ILGA-Europe said Belarus ranked 45th out of 49 countries in its annual survey of the freedoms of LGBTQ+ people in Europe and Central Asia, noting that “pro-government propagandists regularly call for persecution of LGBT activists.”
Since the start of an unrelenting crackdown on dissent in August 2020, after an election the opposition and the West denounced as a sham gave Lukashenko his sixth term in office, LGBTQ+ people have begun leaving Belarus en masse, seeking political asylum in the Czech Republic, France, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United States.
Belarus is a close ally of Russia, where a law against “gay propaganda” has been in place since 2013, prohibiting the promotion of “non-traditional” sexual relationships.
The Russian Supreme Court banned what the government called the LGBTQ+ “movement” in Russia in November 2023, labeling it an extremist organization. The ruling was part of a crackdown on LGBTQ+ people in the increasingly conservative country where “traditional family values” have become a cornerstone of President Vladimir Putin’s 24-year rule."

There is a lot of money to be made in pushing the myth of climate change, and when scientific facts put those potential profits in jeopardy, those with a vested interest in the lie are pushing back with lawsuits.
According to the journal Nature, 2,666 climate litigation cases had been filed around the world by the end of last year. Not surprisingly, the U.S. was leading the world in climate litigation cases with 1,745, followed by the UK with 139 and Australia and Brazil with 132 and 82, respectively. Just 8% of the recorded cases came from low and middle income countries. With both Panama and Portugal seeing their first climate litigation cases last year, 55 countries have now recorded such cases.
Some of them are related to the fact that the Paris Climate Agreement, which is considered legally binding, saw countries vow to keep their average temperatures within 1.5 degrees Celsius of their pre-Industrial levels. Setting aside the fact that it’s considered nearly impossible to measure this accurately thanks to the imprecision involved in measuring temperatures down to a tenth of a degree, especially in pre-industrial times, there are numerous other problems with the concept of climate change lawsuits.
It is also worth noting that many of the companies that are facing these ridiculous lawsuits are not fossil fuel companies, although they are often targets of the climate change crowd despite alarmists themselves still relying on fossil fuels. Instead, the targets are companies that produce a variety of goods and services ranging from tobacco and paper to media and health services.
A considerable number of these lawsuits are filed by NGOs and individuals who stand to gain from perpetuating the belief that it is possible for these companies to control the climate.
In the coming months, the International Court of Justice in The Hague is scheduled to start hearing evidence supporting two overarching questions related to climate change. One is what obligations nations have under international law to protect the climate from greenhouse gas emissions, while the second is what legal consequences would be appropriate for those whose actions, or lack of actions, lead to harm.
Meanwhile, the state of California has been pursuing some of the world’s biggest oil companies, such as Shell, Chevron and BP, as well as their subsidiaries, and demanding payment “for the costs of their impacts to the environment, human health and Californians’ livelihoods, and to help protect the state against the harms that climate change will cause in years to come.”
A famous case from last year saw a judge in Montana ruling in favor of claims by young residents that state officials infringed on their right to a healthy and clean environment via their promotion of fossil fuels.
There have also been a number of cases over so-called “climate washing,” which takes place when a business is accused of misrepresenting the progress that it has made toward reaching its environmental targets. Dozens of these cases were filed against governments and businesses in 2023, and those who file these cases are often succeeding.
According to The Guardian, of the 140 climate washing cases that were filed between 2016 and 2023 and studied in a review, 77 had been officially concluded and 54 of them had resulted in rulings in favor of the plaintiff.

DUBICZE CERKIEWNE, Poland (AP) — Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Wednesday that its forces would further fortify the border with Belarus and can use “all available means” to defend the NATO nation’s frontier, after a soldier was seriously wounded with a knife by a migrant.
Tusk said that a buffer zone some 200 meters (660 feet) wide would be set up along the border, which is also the European Union’s eastern frontier, in addition to a 190-kilometer (118-mile) long metal barrier already in place to prevent an influx of migrants crossing from Belarus. Poland says the pressure of illegal migration is organized by Belarus and Russia.
Tusk said the government will make a decision on the buffer zone next week.
Tusk, together with the defense and interior ministers, visited troops, border guards and police forces securing the border following a knife attack on a soldier early Tuesday near the village of Dubicze Cerkiewne.
Officials said the soldier remains hospitalized in serious condition.
Officials said a migrant reached across the bars of the more than 5-meter (16-foot) high metal wall separating Poland and Belarus and stabbed the soldier in the ribs. Polish security forces were not able to detain the attacker because he was on the Belarus side of the barrier, officials said.
“There is no room for negotiation. Poland’s border must be protected,” Tusk said. “Polish troops, border guards, officers have become the targets of aggression and you have every right, not to say an obligation, to use every means available to you ... when you are defending not only the border but also you own life,” Tusk said.
Tusk and Defense Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz said that additional police and military forces will be sent to the area.
The pro-EU government says the pressure and aggression of illegal migration is rising, pushed by Russia and Belarus to destabilize Europe as Moscow wages war on Ukraine. Poland’s authorities say migrants groups now mainly include young men, compared to families with women and children previously. More than 13,000 attempts at illegal crossing were registered so far this year, a rise from the same period last year.

2382,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-05-13,"How Covid-19's symptoms have changed with each new variant
With a new variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus causing a spike in cases, it is demonstrating just how much the disease has changed since the pandemic began – and what happened to ""Covid toe"".
""For almost four years, I've managed to dodge Covid-19,"" TV broadcaster Mehdi Hasan tweeted a fortnight ago. ""But it finally got me. At the end of 2023.""
Hasan added that his symptoms were thankfully mild, but he is just one of many people reporting their first ever positive test for the virus responsible for the pandemic, Sars-CoV-2, four years on from when it first began spreading around the world.
What are the symptoms of JN.1 and KP.2
The version of the Covid-19 virus behind the latest spike in infections shares many of the same symptoms as earlier variants of Sars-CoV-2 : a sore throat, fatigue, headache and a cough.
Differences in the symptoms often depend on a person's underlying health and their immune system. But some clinicians are reporting among the most common first signs of an infection by JN.1 are diarrhoea or a headache. Fewer patients are losing their sense of smell with variants closely-related to Omicron, of which JN.1 is a subvariant.
Another Omicron subvariant, KP.2 shares many genetic features with JN.1, but shows two distinctive mutations in its spike protein, leading to the nickname ""FLiRT"" as a way of describing specific amino acid changes. Although KP.2 has a higher reproductive number than JN.1, suggesting it is more transmissible, the virus itself has been found to be up to 10 times less infectious. It's symptoms are said to be similar to those experienced with other Omnicron variants.
Covid-19 cases are starting to rise again as a result of the KP.2 Covid subvariant, which was first reported on 2 January but started to become the dominant version of the virus in many countries in May 2024. By 13 May 2024, it accounted for 28% of cases in the US. It follows a rise in cases earlier in the year due to the JN.1 Covid subvariant, which appeared last September in France. This subvariant accounted for around 60% of new infections in early January, according to a data tracker from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
At the same time, data from both the CDC and the UK Health Security Agency shows that hospitalisations and deaths from Covid-19 are markedly lower compared to May 2023. Primary care physicians say they are finding it virtually impossible to distinguish Covid-19 symptoms from influenza without the help of a PCR test.
""When Covid first came, it was characterised by these very odd, vague symptoms – from brain fog, feeling exhausted, and losing taste and smell,"" says Ziad Tukmachi, a GP at Chartfield Surgery in south-west London, UK. ""Now I feel it's mutated to more similar symptoms to the flu, where it's very difficult clinically to distinguish between the two.""
While this might all suggest that the virus is evolving to become progressively less pathogenic, epidemiologists believe that the reality of the situation is more nuanced.
""The virus isn't necessarily less pathogenic,"" says Greg Towers, professor of molecular virology at University College London, UK. ""Rather, it's infecting a population that are less inclined to become sick, because they've seen Sars-CoV-2 before, and they're better at regulating [their] immune response against it.""
Now, in 2024, this is determined by a much more complex cocktail of factors, including how many times that person has already been infected by the virus, their vaccination status, and whether their vaccination-induced immunity might be on the wane.
As a result, Denis Nash, an epidemiologist at the City University of New York, US, says that people now experiencing Covid-19 for the very first time are at greater risk, especially if it has been a while since their last booster vaccine.
""There are still people who have somehow managed to remain completely Covid-näive,"" says Nash. ""If they are unvaccinated or under vaccinated, they stand to have the highest risk of severe and protracted symptoms.""
Still, Sars-CoV-2 is also constantly mutating, something which is also subtly shifting how it attempts to invade the human body. The JN.1 variant has an elevated ability to evade the immune system, for example, compared to other Omicron sub-variants. But this is also altering the way it affects the human body.
In 2023, researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University's School of Medicine reported that people now being infected with Omicron-related subvariants are just 6-7% as likely to lose their sense of smell or taste, compared to infections by the virus in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Instead, some clinicians such as David Strain, associate professor of cardiometabolic health at the University of Exeter, UK, told the BBC that his patients are more likely to present either with diarrhoea or a headache having been infected with JN.1 or the EG.5 variants.
""There has been a huge shift in viral tropism, meaning which cells get infected,"" says Towers. ""And that's governed by the sequence of the spike protein. Almost everybody in the world has been infected or vaccinated, so the virus is under huge pressure to escape those immune responses to continue to transmit, so the spike protein has evolved a lot. This leads to it infecting different cells to gain entry, which is why people aren't losing their smell or taste anymore.""
Researchers are still trying to figure out whether some more subtle, internal consequences of Sars-CoV-2 infection varies between variants of the virus or whether any differences are more driven by the waning of previous vaccine-induced protection. One of the ongoing concerns remains the virus' ability to cause damage to blood vessels and internal organs through the creation of micro clots, with the kidney – an organ which is constructed of approximately one million tiny blood vessels called capillaries – seemingly particularly vulnerable based on the patients Strain has seen.
""These are just observations but we're seeing more microvascular complications and a step change in the kidney function with the new JN.1 variant that does appear to be worse than the past couple of variants,"" says Strain. ""But it's difficult to say whether it's the variant, or the fact it's 18 months to two years now since a lot of people last received a vaccine.""
With some emerging evidence hinting that micro clots might be a cause of Long Covid – a study in August 2023 even suggested that they could contribute to the cognitive problems experienced by many Long Covid patients – researchers are now concerned that we might go on to see a further spike in chronic cases. However, it would be hard to distinguish whether this is a consequence of the new variant or declining population immunity.
""Studies from the March-summer 2020 period show that the risk of Long Covid from any case, was about 10%,"" says Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London. ""Now we have far more infections, and the risk of Long Covid looks to have fallen, not because of a milder variant but because of a degree of protection from vaccine doses. A paper in the BMJ on a national cohort in Sweden shows protection goes up with each additional dose.""
This all indicates the ongoing importance for all age groups of remaining up to date with vaccine boosters, but while politicians have long been keen to move on from Covid, Strain says it is vital to keep monitoring how different variants continue to infect us.
""Symptoms do seem to change from one variant to another,"" he says. ""We've had periods where the earliest symptom is headache, and others where it's more gastrointestinal. We all to go back to life as normal, but the reality is, Covid isn't going anywhere.""

Whatever happened to ""Covid toe""?
In the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic, reports of an unusual and baffling symptom of the disease began to emerge – patients were developing painful or intolerably itchy lesions on their feet and hands. These chilblain-like swelling and reddening of the skin became commonly known as ""Covid toe"".
Doctors and scientists were puzzled – how did a respiratory virus cause such a strange symptom in the body's extremities?
Tests on samples taken from people with Covid toe have failed to find the presence of the virus responsible for Covid-19, Sars-CoV-2, in the chilblains, suggesting the virus itself is not directly responsible. Instead, a number of hypotheses have been put forward, including that it could be the result of an excessive response by part of the immune system that produces a protein called interferon IFN-1, which helps the immune system target cells infected by viruses.
Others have suggested that it may not be something specific to Covid-19 at all, and rather just a response that occurs in people who are prone to chilblains anyway.
Another theory was that lockdown rules meant more people were just not wearing adequate footwear around their homes and too much time sitting still.
Curiously, as the virus has evolved and lockdowns have lifted, so too has the apparent occurrence of these cutaneous problems. Research by scientists at King College London, UK, who studied the reported symptoms of more than 348,000 people who logged their Covid symptoms via a mobile app, has revealed that Covid toe and related skin complaints have decreased in more recent waves of the Sars-CoV-2 virus.
They were reported by 11% of people during the wave caused by the Omicron variant, compared to 17% in the Delta variant wave, where symptoms also tended to last longer.

3586,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-09-14,"A £42m screening trial aimed at revolutionising the treatment of prostate cancer has been launched in the UK.
Thousands of men will be involved in its initial phase, which will begin in a few months. Several hundred thousand volunteers could be recruited as the programme progresses in coming years, say the trial’s organisers.
The trial, known as Transform, has been funded by Prostate Cancer UK with significant support from the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), Movember and other partners, and has been set up because the condition has remained an intractable health problem in the UK for decades. One in eight men get prostate cancer in the UK and about 12,000 die of it each year.
Yet there is no screening service available to pinpoint the disease’s early, treatable stages. Symptoms frequently do not appear until the cancer has spread and has become incurable.
“The aim of Transform is straightforward,” said Dr Matthew Hobbs, the director of research for Prostate Cancer UK. “We want to find the most effective, least harmful methods to screen the UK’s adult male population for prostate cancer and catch the disease in its early stages.”
The prostate, a gland only found in men, is the size of a walnut and makes fluid which protects the tube that carries urine and sperm out of the body. When cancers develop there, they can remain without noticeable effect. It is only when these cancerous cells spread in some cases to the rest of the body that they trigger illness.
In the UK, more than 52,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year, about 140 a day. In total, around 490,000 men are affected by the condition.
In the past, cases have been pinpointed by detecting a chemical known as prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, in a man’s blood. Those with elevated levels can then be offered biopsies in which tissue from the prostate is removed by inserting a needle through the rectum.
“The trouble is that a high level of PSA in the blood does not necessarily mean a man has prostate cancer,” said Hobbs. “In addition, cancerous cells in a prostate do not necessarily spread round the body in every case. They can remain dormant.
“This means that biopsies can sometimes be carried out unnecessarily, which is a problem because it can be painful and sometimes leads to infections and occasionally sepsis.”
As a result, the UK National Screening Committee, which advises the government on health testing programmes, has refused to give the go-ahead for a national prostate programme on the grounds that it would do more harm than good.
“That has to change,” said Prof Hashim Ahmed of Imperial College London, who is one of the lead researchers on the Transform trial. “We have to be in the position that we are with breast and cervical cancer when a woman is invited by her GP to have a mammogram or a cervical smear. By contrast, prostate cancer testing is irregular, patchy and unsystematic.”
It is the aim of Transform – one of the largest medical research trials launched in the UK in recent years and whose funding includes £16m from the government – to put this right by pinpointing better ways to screen for prostate cancer.
Newly developed techniques, such as MRI scans that can spot affected prostates instead of relying solely on PSA tests to determine who to biopsy or not, will be tested as an alternative to biopsies. In addition, new gene tests will be used to highlight those who may be at elevated risk of getting the condition because of inherited susceptibilities.
“There is no major gene that puts a man at much higher risk of prostate cancer but there are around 400 that, in combination, raise the chances of man being affected,” said Hobbs. “We can use this panel of genes to test to see if they can pinpoint those who are at high risk. This could then form part of future screening programmes.”
Another problem for those tackling the condition is the response of those most at risk of the disease. Black men are twice as likely to get prostate cancer but are far less likely to come forward for testing. In trials to establish whether a national screening programme was viable, black men were far less likely than white men to respond to requests to sign up.
“That is a very worrying statistic and we urgently need to get round this problem,” said Prof Caroline Moore, the head of urology at University College London, who is also a lead researcher on Transform. Her team is to launch a “scan-in-a-van” service at a site in west London this year, where MRI scans in a mobile centre will be offered to black men over 45 to test for possible signs of prostate cancers.
“Instead of going through GPs, we will contact them through local community groups,” she said. “Hopefully, community scanning schemes can be incorporated into prostate screening programmes in future. It will be another part of the package, we hope.”"

2872,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-06-17,"UN food chief: Poorest areas have zero harvests left
Droughts and flooding have become so common in some of the poorest places on Earth that the land can no longer sustain crops, the director of the World Food Programme’s global office has said.
Martin Frick told the BBC that some of the most deprived areas had now reached a tipping point of having “zero” harvests left, as extreme weather was pushing already degraded land beyond use.
He said that as a result, parts of Africa, the Middle East and Latin America were now dependent on humanitarian aid.
Mr Frick warned that without efforts to reverse land degradation globally, richer countries would also begin to suffer crop failures.
The Global Environment Facility estimates that 95% of the world’s land could become degraded by 2050. The UN says that 40% is already degraded.
When soil degrades, the organic matter that binds it together dies off. This means that it is less able to support plant life – reducing crop yields – and absorb carbon from the atmosphere.
Soil is the second largest carbon sink after the oceans, and is recognised by the UN as a key tool for mitigating climate change.
“There's too much carbon in the air and too little carbon in the soils,” Mr Frick said. “With every inch of soil that you're growing, you're removing enormous amounts of carbon out of the atmosphere.
“So healthy soils – carbon-rich soils – are a prerequisite to fixing climate change.”
Land degradation can be caused by modern farming techniques removing organic content from soil, but also prolonged droughts interspersed with sudden, extreme rainfall.
Scientists say many extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense as a result of climate change.
While it is hard to link climate change to specific droughts, scientists have said global warming has made certain ones, like the recent one in East Africa, more likely.
Mr Frick said that in Burundi, in East Africa, months of heavy rain and flooding had damaged 10% of its farmland, making it unusable for the upcoming harvest season.
He pointed to a UN report, released in March, which found that cereal crops in the Darfur region of Sudan were 78% below the average for the previous five years amid civil war and drought.
Meanwhile, flash floods in Afghanistan earlier this year are estimated to have destroyed 24,000 hectares of land already considered highly degraded.
Environmentalists expect that as soil degrades, failing crops will strain global food supplies and increase migration from affected areas.
“It's going to be disaster for human beings,” Praveena Sridhar, chief science officer of environmental group Save Soil, said. “It’s going to be like Mad Max.”
She added: “There will be no humanity. There will be no charity. There will be no fairness... The only thing that lets you be will be survival.”
Mr Frick said that, as a father of three, he was “not a fan of doomsday scenarios”, but admitted that “what we are seeing is most worrying”.
But he argued such an eventuality could be avoided by moving toward localised farming that seeks to reinvigorate the land.
The food agency chief said there was currently an “unhealthy dependence” on crops such as wheat, maize and rice, and the few nations that are large-scale exporters of them – creating food shortages that particularly affect the developing world when those nations’ harvests are interrupted.
He noted how the Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused grain shortages in places such as East Africa.
Mr Frick said that to tackle hunger and land degradation at the same time, the world’s poorest should be incentivised to rejuvenate degraded land through regenerative practices – including by being made eligible for funds from carbon credits schemes.
He cited a WFP project in Niger in which local women had created micro-dams in arid land to slow the movement of water, then used dung and straw to create a basin in which trees could be planted. The trees created shade from the sun, allowing the women to grow fruit and vegetables.
“Suddenly, within the space of three to five years, the place that was really a desert comes back as agricultural production land without artificial irrigation,” he said.
“They don't have to worry about inflation because they can substitute what they would need to buy otherwise in their own gardens. And a community garden in Bristol can do exactly the same thing.”
But Ms Sridar said the longer it takes to implement these sorts of regenerative farming techniques, the harder it will be to recover lost soil biodiversity – making humans increasingly vulnerable to shocks to the food supply.
At a UN conference in 2015, it was suggested that there were only 60 harvests left before soil becomes too degraded to support viable crops – though experts dispute hard estimates as the rate of degradation and the state of the soil differs across the world.
Mr Frick said: “How many harvests you have left is largely a function of... how we get our food production in tune with the realities of this planet.”"

Dr Joseph Mercola has written many articles discussing the evidence of biological harm from nonionizing electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation and radiofrequency radiation (RFR) from wireless technologies. He has continually underlined that the wireless industry is built on the premise that the only type of radiation capable of causing harm is ionizing, such as X-rays. This is not true and Dr Mercola has recently analysed new studies conducted between 2022 and 2024 that contradict the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection guidelines, and has shown that radiofrequency radiation (RFR) amd warn that even non-ionizing and non-heating radiation is a risk to health of plants, animals and humans potentially causing cancer, neurological damage, dementia and more. One recent study in particular found significant changes in the fecal microbiome and metabolome profiles in mice exposed to 5G RFR, which Dr Mercola says hints at ‘broader implications for health.’

- Research contradicts the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection guidelines, demonstrating various harmful biological effects of radiofrequency radiation (RFR) on humans and the environment, including potential cancer risk
- Studies reveal 5G’s potential to induce neurological damage and psychiatric problems, highlighting its effects on brain development, including the increased risk of conditions like dementia through mechanisms such as the impairment of neurosin
- A December 2023 study illustrates the detrimental effects of 5G RFR on rat sperm, showing decreased sperm count and quality, with melatonin offering a protective effect
- February 2024 research indicates significant changes in the fecal microbiome and metabolome profiles in mice exposed to 5G RFR, hinting at broader implications for health, including mental well-being and immune function
Over the past decade, I’ve written many articles discussing the evidence of biological harm from nonionizing electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation and radiofrequency radiation (RFR) from wireless technologies.
The video above features an interview I did with Siim Land in February 2020 for his Body Mind Empowerment podcast in which I discuss EMF — what it is, your greatest sources of exposure, how it affects your biology, and how to minimize your exposure. I also review how the telecommunications industry manipulates the truth to keep you unaware of the potential hazards.
While the wireless industry is built on the premise that the only type of radiation capable of causing harm is ionizing — X-rays being one example — researchers have for a long time warned that even non-ionizing and non-heating radiation can jeopardize your health. This includes not only human health, but also that of plants and animals.
Over time, I became so convinced of the deleterious effects of EMF, I took three years to write “EMF*D” which was published in 2020. In it, I reviewed the overwhelming evidence showing EMFs are a hidden health hazard that simply cannot be ignored any longer.
During the pandemic, we also witnessed the rollout and installation of 5G across the country, which has exponentially increased exposures, as it’s added on top of the already existing wireless infrastructure.
The short video below, published by Investigative Europe in January 2019, gives a quick overview of how 5G differs from previous wireless technology. At the time, little if any research had been done on 5G specifically, but between 2022 and 2024, 10 new studies have been published that shed more light on this fifth-generation technology.1
5G Appeals for Moratorium Ignored Despite Evidence
The first of these, published in September 2022 in the journal Reviews on Environmental Health,2 provides a good overview of the hazards 5G poses. The authors pointed out that, since September 2017, over 400 scientists and doctors have collectively submitted six appeals to the European Union, calling for a moratorium on 5G technology. All have been ignored.
The September 2021 appeal included an “extensive cover letter” in which experts argued that the EU’s reliance on guidelines by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) places public health at risk because the guidelines only consider “heating and no other health relevant biological effects from RFR.”
The letter countered the ICNIRP’s guidance with research from European and international expert groups detailing myriad adverse biological effects of RFR on humans and the environment. According to the authors:3
“Evidence to establish this position is drawn from studies showing changes to neurotransmitters and receptors, damage to cells, proteins, DNA, sperm, the immune system, and human health, including cancer.
The 2021 Appeal goes on to warn that 5G signals are likely to additionally alter the behavior of oxygen and water molecules at the quantum level, unfold proteins, damage skin, and cause harm to insects, birds, frogs, plants and animals.”
Aggregation of Signals Pose Serious Concerns
Under the subhead “Great Plans, Great Promises but False Claims,” the authors go on to highlight the government’s own findings:
“… the potential health and safety risks associated with RFR have been exposed in a recent EU-commissioned review of the currently available scientific evidence, the 2021 European Parliamentary Research Service’s EPRS/STOA Health impact of 5G report.4
The conclusions of the comprehensive review declared sufficient evidence for cancer from RFR in animals, sufficient evidence for adverse effects from RFR on the fertility of men, male rats and mice, and that RFR is probably carcinogenic to humans.
In short, the EPRS/STOA report shows that RFR is harmful for health. The report subsequently calls for measures to incentivize the reduction of RF-EMF exposures (p. 153), such as lowering the limit for allowed exposures and the preferential use of wired connections.
Similarly, the EU’s own (ITRE committee) 2019 in-depth analysis, 5G Deployment: State of Play in Europe, USA and Asia5 warned that, when added to 2G, 3G, 4G, WiFi, WIMAX, DECT, radar etc., 5G will cumulatively lead to dramatically more total radiation: not only from the use of much higher frequencies in 5G but also from the potential for the aggregation of different signals, their dynamic nature, and the complex interference effects that may result, especially in dense urban areas (p 11).
These concerns are based on the complexity of communications signals and the unknowns of their interactions. Electromagnetic signals transmitted by manmade communication devices are not regular waves; rather, they are a complex combination of ultra-high frequency carrier waves, and modulations that encode the messages using extremely-low and ultra-low frequencies.
In addition, the signals are pulsed at ultra-low frequencies (sent in short on-off bursts). This means that although the RFR carrier waves may sit in the high frequency GHz range, their modulations and pulse rates are much closer to brain-wave frequencies; e.g., the 217 Hz pulsing of a GSM phone signal.
Pulsed or modulated RFR signals have been shown to be more bio-active than simple continuous waves of the same intensity and exposure duration. This is of significant concern in relation to public health and is not limited to just the higher 5G frequencies.
Furthermore, as the report noted, the effects of these new complex beam formed signals have unpredictable propagation patterns that could result in unacceptable levels of human exposure to electromagnetic radiation (p. 6) but are yet to be mapped reliably for real situations, outside the laboratory.”
5G May Cause Neurological and Psychiatric Problems
The second study,6 published in November 2022, investigated the effects of 4.9 GHz (one of several 5G frequencies) RFR on the emotional behaviors and spatial memory in adult male mice. The exposure was found to induce “depression-like behavior” caused by “neuronal pyroptosis in the amygdala.”
Pyroptosis is a form of programmed cell death distinct from other forms of apoptosis, characterized by its inflammatory response. It involves the swelling and bursting of the cell, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and intracellular contents that can trigger an immune response in the surrounding tissue.
This process is controlled by gasdermin proteins, which form pores in the cell membrane, and is often initiated in response to infections by pathogens or other signals indicating cellular damage.
5G induces cell death in the amygdala, a region of the brain involved in emotion regulation, memory, and decision-making.
The amygdala is a region of the brain involved in emotion regulation, memory, and decision-making. So, pyroptosis in this area could be indicative of neurological damage or inflammation, potentially affecting emotional regulation, behavior, and cognitive functions.
This could be relevant in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, brain injuries, or infections that impact the central nervous system, leading to various neurological and psychiatric implications.
Four Studies Confirm 5G’s Impact on Neurology
Another four studies published in 2023 also show a variety of damage occurring in the brain:
•5G increases permeability of the blood-brain barrier7 — In the first, RFR from 5G cellphones at 3.5 GHz or 4.9 GHz for one hour per day for 35 days straight was found to increase the permeability of the BBB in the cerebral cortex of mice.
•RFR impairs neurogenesis and causes neuronal DNA damage8 — In the second, continuous RFR from cellphones at 2115 MHz for eight hours was shown to induce higher levels of lipid peroxidation, carbon-centered lipid radicals, and single-strand DNA damage, resulting in impaired neurogenesis in the hippocampal region and neuronal degeneration in the dentate gyrus region.
Translation: Cellphone radiation may cause cognitive impairment and deficits, behavioral changes and dysfunctional mood regulation, neurodegenerative disorders (due to the oxidative stress within neurons) and psychiatric conditions such as anxiety and depression.
•Electromagnetic radiation associated with anxiety9 — This study found anxiety-like behavior in male mice exposed electromagnetic radiation at 2650 MHz for four hours a day for 28 days.
•5G may promote dementia10 — Lastly, a follow-up study on previous research concluded that RFRs at 1.8 GHz to 3.5 GHz:
◦Inhibit neurosin, an enzyme that plays a role in brain health, including the breakdown of proteins that, if not properly managed, could lead to conditions like Alzheimer’s disease. This finding suggests that cellphone radiation could potentially interfere with the brain’s ability to prevent the buildup of harmful proteins.
◦Inhibit the electrical activity of neurons in vitro — Neurons communicate with each other using electrical signals and this activity is crucial for everything your brain does, from processing sensory information to controlling muscle movements. Inhibiting electrical activity means disrupting normal brain cell communication, which could potentially impact brain functions.
5G Affects Brain Development
An October 2023 study11 by Bodin et al. investigated the effects of exposure to 5G during the perinatal period — around the time of birth — on the neurodevelopment of rats. The main goal of this study was to explore how being exposed to 5G EMF around the time of birth affects the brain development of rats as they grow into juveniles and adolescents.
Both male and female rat pups exposed to 5G EMF showed delayed incisor (front teeth) eruption. This indicates that EMF exposure could potentially slow down certain aspects of physical development. The study also found notable differences in behavior based on the sex of the rats.
In adolescent female rats, there was a significant reduction (70%) in stereotyped movements, such as repetitive patterns of behavior, in the open field test. This suggests that exposure may reduce certain repetitive behaviors in females. In contrast, male rats exhibited a 50% increase in stereotyped movements, indicating that the same exposure led to an increase in repetitive behaviors.
In short, the research suggests that exposure to 5G EMF at levels below the regulatory threshold during a critical period of development (perinatal period) has the potential to cause disturbances in neurodevelopment. These effects are seen in juvenile and adolescent descendants and manifest differently in males and females.
While it’s difficult to predict what the human health implications of this might be, it’s worth noting that repetitive behaviors are often associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In such cases, these behaviors may signal underlying neurological differences and can impact an individual’s social interactions, learning, and daily functioning.
In some instances, repetitive behaviors can also be symptomatic of anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), stress-related disorders and self-harming behaviors such as skin picking or hair pulling. For some individuals, repetitive behaviors can interfere with attention and focus, affecting academic performance, workplace productivity, and the ability to complete daily tasks efficiently.
It can also affect an individual’s social interactions and relationships, and can lead to social isolation, bullying, or stigma, particularly in children and adolescents, further impacting emotional well-being and self-esteem. Repetitive behaviors, particularly those associated with anxiety or compulsive disorders, can also disrupt sleep patterns, leading to insomnia or poor sleep quality, which in turn affects overall health and well-being.
RFR Decimates Male Fertility — Melatonin Can Help Restore It
A December 2023 study,12 which explored the negative effects of long-term exposure to 2100 MHz RFR on rat sperm characteristics, brought both good and bad news.
On the downside, male rats exposed to RFR at 2100 MHz for 30 minutes a day had a significantly higher percentage of sperm with abnormal shapes. There was also a significant reduction in the total sperm count among the exposed rats.
At a more detailed level, examining the sperm structure under a microscope (the ultrastructural level), damage was observed in critical parts of the sperm, including the:
- Acrosome, a cap-like structure that helps the sperm penetrate an egg
- Axoneme, the central shaft of the sperm tail
- Mitochondrial sheath, which powers the sperm tail’s movement
- Outer dense fibers, which are part of the sperm tail
The good news is that melatonin supplementation was able to prevent these problems. Rats given 10 milligrams of melatonin per kilo of bodyweight via subcutaneous administration had increased sperm counts and the proportion of sperms with normal shapes increased. Moreover, the ultrastructural damage to sperm caused by RF exposure was fully reversed. As reported by the authors:
“The percentages of abnormal sperm morphology were significantly increased with RF exposure, while the total sperm count was significantly decreased … The number of total sperms, sperms with normal morphology increased, and ultrastructural appearance returned to normal by melatonin administration.”
Case Study of 8-Year-Old Boy
In January 2024, Hardell et al. presented a case study13 of an eight-year-old boy experiencing severe headaches and other symptoms while attending a school located near a mobile phone tower equipped with 5G base stations.
The boy’s school is situated 200 meters away from a mobile phone tower with 5G base stations, with his classroom being 285 meters away. Soon after starting school, he began experiencing headaches, which were initially sporadic, not occurring every day or every week.
By autumn 2023, the boy’s headaches intensified, occurring daily and rated as a 10 on a 10-grade scale, where 0 signifies no discomfort and 10 indicates unbearable pain. He also experienced fatigue (rated 5) and occasional dizziness (rated 7), specifically while at school. At home, he occasionally had mild headaches (rated 2) that subsided relatively quickly.
In the autumn of 2023, he started wearing an RF-protective cap and outerwear at school, both indoors and outside, after which the headaches vanished.
This paper also cites epidemiological studies and laboratory research linking RF radiation exposure to cancer through mechanisms such as oxidative stress, mRNA effects and DNA damage, and argues for classifying RF radiation as a Group 1 human carcinogen, noting that “This classification should have a major impact on prevention measures.”
5G Alters Your Microbiome
Lastly, a February 2024 study14 by Wang et al. examined the impact of 5G RFR on the fecal microbiome and metabolome profiles in mice. The results indicated that the mice exposed to RFR experienced significant alterations in their intestinal microbial compositions, characterized by a decrease in microbial diversity and shifts in the microbial community distribution.
Through metabolomics profiling, the researchers identified 258 metabolites that were significantly differentially abundant in the mice exposed to RF fields compared to controls, which suggests it can have a profound impact on metabolic processes.
The authors concluded that exposure to 4.9 GHz RFR can cause intestinal microbiota dysbiosis in mice and hypothesized that the observed imbalances in gut microbiota and metabolism might be linked to depression-like behaviors in mice seen in so many studies. The imbalance in the metabolic profile may also be associated with changes in immune regulation or inflammation.
5G Will Harm Every Living Being
In September 2019, the Minister for Communications, Hon. Paul Fletcher MP asked the Committee to complete and inquiry into the “deployment, adoption and application of 5G in Australia.”15 In response, Paul Barratt, on behalf of ElectricSense, submitted a document, available as a download from aph.org, stating, in part:
“5G is dangerous and will harm every living being. Thousands of studies link low-level wireless radio frequency radiation exposures to a long list of adverse biological effects, including:
- DNA single and double strand breaks
- oxidative damage
- disruption of cell metabolism
- increased blood brain barrier permeability
- melatonin reduction
- disruption to brain glucose metabolism
- generation of stress proteins
Let’s not also forget that in 2011 the World Health Organization (WHO) classified radio frequency radiation as a possible 2B carcinogen. More recently the $25 million National Toxicology Program concluded that radio frequency radiation of the type currently used by cell phones can cause cancer.
But where does 5G fit into all this? Given that 5G is set to utilize frequencies above and below existing frequency bands 5G sits in the middle of all this. But the tendency (it varies from country to country) is for 5G to utilize the higher frequency bands. Which brings its own particular concerns.”
Barratt goes on to list “11 reasons to be concerned about 5G radiation,” including:
Denser electrosmog
Skin diseases and pain, as “analyses of penetration depth show that more than 90% of the transmitted power is absorbed in the epidermis and dermis layer”16
Eye damage
Effects on the heart, including impacts on heart rate variability and arrhythmias
Reduced immune function
Depressed cell growth rates and alterations in cell properties and cell activity
Increased risk of antibiotic-resistant pathogens
Necrosis in plants, and the possibility that plant foods may become unsuitable for human consumption
Atmospheric effects and fossil fuel depletion
Eco system disruptions
Misleading 5G study results, as most do not pulse the waves. As noted by Barratt, “This is important because research on microwaves already tells us how pulsed waves have more profound biological effects on our body compared to non-pulsed waves. Previous studies, for instance, show how pulse rates of the frequencies led to gene toxicity and DNA strand breaks”
Protect Yourself and Your Family From Excessive EMF
There’s no doubt in my mind that RF-EMF exposure is a significant hazard that needs to be addressed if you’re concerned about your health. The rollout of 5G certainly makes remedial action more difficult, but the added hazards are all the more reason to get involved and do what we can to minimize exposure.
Here are several suggestions that will help reduce your EMF exposure and help mitigate damage from unavoidable exposures. For even more do’s and don’ts, see the infographic by the Environmental Health Trust below.
Identify major sources of EMF, such as your cellphone, cordless phones, Wi-Fi routers, Bluetooth headsets and other Bluetooth-equipped items, wireless mice, keyboards, smart thermostats, baby monitors, smart meters and the microwave in your kitchen. Ideally, address each source and determine how you can best limit their use.
Barring a life-threatening emergency, children should not use a cellphone or a wireless device of any type. Children are far more vulnerable to cellphone radiation than adults due to having thinner skull bones.
Research17 also demonstrates that infants under the age of 1 do not effectively learn language from videos, and do not transfer what they learn from the iPad to the real world, so it’s a mistake to think electronic devices provide valuable education.
Connect your desktop computer to the internet via a wired Ethernet connection and be sure to put your desktop in airplane mode. Also avoid wireless keyboards, trackballs, mice, game systems, printers and portable house phones. Opt for the wired versions.
If you must use Wi-Fi, shut it off when not in use, especially at night when you’re sleeping. Ideally, work toward hardwiring your house so you can eliminate Wi-Fi altogether. If you have a notebook without any Ethernet ports, a USB Ethernet adapter will allow you to connect to the internet with a wired connection.
Avoid using wireless chargers for your cellphone, as they too will increase EMFs throughout your home. Wireless charging is also far less energy efficient than using a dongle attached to a power plug, as it draws continuous power (and emits EMF) whether you’re using it or not.
Shut off the electricity to your bedroom at night. This typically works to reduce electrical fields from the wires in your wall unless there is an adjoining room next to your bedroom. If that is the case, you will need to use a meter to determine if you also need to turn off power in the adjacent room.
Use a battery-powered alarm clock, ideally one without any light.
If you still use a microwave oven, consider replacing it with a steam convection oven, which will heat your food as quickly and far more safely.
Avoid using “smart” appliances and thermostats that depend on wireless signaling. This would include all new “smart” TVs. They are called smart because they emit a Wi-Fi signal and, unlike your computer, you cannot shut the Wi-Fi signal off. Consider using a large computer monitor as your TV instead, as they don’t emit Wi-Fi.
Refuse a smart meter on your home as long as you can, or add a shield to an existing smart meter, some of which have been shown to reduce radiation by 98% to 99%.18
Consider moving your baby’s bed into your room instead of using a wireless baby monitor. Alternatively, use a hard-wired monitor.
Replace CFL bulbs with incandescent bulbs. Ideally remove all fluorescent lights from your house. Not only do they emit unhealthy light, but more importantly, they will actually transfer current to your body just being close to the bulbs.
Avoid carrying your cellphone on your body unless in airplane mode and never sleep with it in your bedroom unless it is in airplane mode. Even in airplane mode it can emit signals, which is why I put my phone in a Faraday bag.19
When using your cellphone, use the speaker phone and hold the phone at least 3 feet away from you. Seek to radically decrease your time on the cellphone. Instead, use VoIP software phones that you can use while connected to the internet via a wired connection.
Avoid using your cellphone and other electronic devices at least an hour (preferably several) before bed, as the blue light from the screen and EMFs both inhibit melatonin production.20,21
Research clearly shows that heavy computer and cellphone users are more prone to insomnia.22 For example, one 2008 study23 revealed that people exposed to radiation from their mobile phones for three hours before bedtime had more trouble falling asleep and staying in a deep sleep.
The effects of EMFs are reduced by calcium-channel blockers, so make sure you’re getting enough magnesium. Most people are deficient in magnesium, which will worsen the impact of EMFs. As previously noted by EMF expert Dr. Martin Pall:
“When you’re deficient in magnesium, you get excessive activity of the VGCCs. You also get excessive calcium influx through the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, caused by magnesium deficiency, which is also problematic, so it’s important to allay that deficiency.”
Pall has also published a paper24 suggesting that raising your level of Nrf2 may help ameliorate EMF damage. One simple way to activate Nrf2 is to consume Nrf2-boosting food compounds. Examples include sulforaphane-containing cruciferous vegetables, foods high in phenolic antioxidants, carotenoids (especially lycopene), sulfur compounds from allum vegetables, isothiocyanates from the cabbage group, and terpenoid-rich foods.
Molecular hydrogen has been shown to target free radicals produced in response to radiation, such as peroxynitrites. Studies have shown molecular hydrogen can mitigate about 80% of this damage.25,26,27,28,29
Molecular hydrogen will also activate Nrf2, a biological hormetic that upregulates superoxide dismutase, catalase and all the other beneficial intercellular antioxidants. This in turn lowers inflammation, improves your mitochondrial function and stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis.

Summit Carbon Solutions is back at it in Iowa trying to steal private farmland for use in its massive “carbon capture” scam.
The Iowa Utility Board (IUB) reportedly approved a proposal by Summit to build a carbon dioxide (CO2) pipeline that stretches across five Midwestern states: Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. The pipeline is slated to cover 2,500 miles – the portion in Iowa is supposed to be 680 miles long – and connect with 57 ethanol plants, a spokeswoman from the company revealed.
The IUB decision will allow Summit to use eminent domain to steal 859 land parcels from private landowners, the vast majority of whom are opposed to the “green” project, which aims to bury CO2 underground so it cannot “pollute” the environment.
“After weighing numerous factors for and against Summit Carbon’s petition, the Board found that the service to be provided by Summit Carbon will promote the public convenience and necessity,” UIB said in its decision.
(Related: Don’t be fooled, conservatives – many Republican politicians are selling out farmers to these “green” energy scams.)
There are conditions attached to the approval that include forcing Summit to submit revised exhibits for IUB review. Summit will also have to:
1) Obtain and maintain at least a $100 million insurance policy
2) Adhere to specific construction methods
3) Ensure compensation for landowners and tenants for any construction-related damages
4) Receive approval from the other four states involved in the project

“The momentum will continue as we prepare to file our South Dakota permit application in early July,” said Summit CEO Lee Blank. “We look forward to engaging with the state throughout this process and are confident in a successful outcome.”
Those opposed to the project, including hordes of private landowners, say Summit’s CO2 pipeline will only benefit the company while providing no benefits to the public.
“There is a deep-rooted passion for our farm ground in many farmers, and to have something like this rip it apart for something so unnecessary is unimaginable,” said Austin Hayek, a farmer from Fort Dodge, Iowa, who like many of his neighbors fears the pipeline will disrupt his ability to maintain and pass down his farming legacy to the next generation.
Like with all other green scams, carbon pipelines would not even be possible were it not for federal tax credits paid for by U.S. taxpayers. Electric vehicles (EVs), solar panels, carbon pipelines and all the rest exist because of taxpayer-funded subsidies and other benefits not afforded to other industries.
“This is far from over,” commented Jess Mazour, chapter conservation coordinator of the Sierra Club of Iowa, about the UIB approval. “We will appeal this decision and make our arguments in front of a fair decision maker.”
In May 2023, a South Dakota farmer named Jared Bossly won his case against Summit, this being a little silver lining to the whole fiasco. On X, someone wrote that threatened farmers in all of the affected states need to file their own lawsuits against Summit.
“Every farmer needs to post signs with this exact verbiage on their property,” she wrote about the following statement to be posted on farms:
“NO TRESPASSING: Trespassers will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law – No immunity for criminal trespass by government parties.”
Another pointed out just how far America is falling from grace when private companies can successfully declare eminent domain on other people’s private property.
Unless Americans take a stand against these kinds of projects, our entire country will eventually be taken over by green tyrants. Learn more at GreenTyranny.news.

2253,real,ANTI_MIGRATION_AND_XENOPHOBIA,2024-01-24,"Spain, Greece and Hungary have been rebuked by courts for failing to protect the rights of children.
It adds to a string of recent rulings that have reprimanded countries across Europe over the treatment of lone minors who are seeking asylum.
Spain’s supreme court ruled that the government’s decision to deport hundreds of Moroccan youths, after a 2021 mass border crossing into the enclave of Ceuta, was illegal.
The unaccompanied children were among thousands of people who crossed into the seven-square mile territory as Madrid and Rabat argued over the status of the Western Sahara.
Months later, around 700 youths were sent back to Morocco. The court said that the exceptional circumstances of the mass crossing did not warrant the deportations, ruling instead that the collective expulsions amounted to a breach of the country’s domestic immigration laws and the European convention on human rights.
The leftist coalition government had failed to consider the interest of the minors or verify their individual circumstances, the court noted, meaning the children were “put in serious danger of suffering physical or psychological harm”.
As the deportations loomed in 2021, the Spanish broadcaster RTVE spoke to 10 children, all of them between the ages of 13 and 16, who said they had fled state care and were now living rough amid fears of being deported.
“We would be worse off than we are here,” one child told the broadcaster, as others said authorities had not asked them about their individual circumstances or where they would go.
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, Spain’s interior minister, defended the deportations, saying that the authorities had acted “with the full conviction of complying with the legal system and guided by the principle of the best interests of the child”.
The ruling was made days after the European court of human rights (ECHR) said Hungary had violated the rights of a 16-year-old Iraqi Kurd asylum seeker after police pushed him back into the Serbian wilderness.
The boy said he had told police that he wanted to request asylum, the court noted. “The court cannot ignore that at the time of his removal the applicant was an unaccompanied minor, and therefore in a situation of extreme vulnerability,” it added, noting that the age of asylum seekers “should take precedence” over the child’s status as an irregular migrant.
The ruling was welcomed by the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, the NGO that had helped to lodge the case. “The Hungarian state treats children in need of asylum this way,” it said in a statement.
“Instead of deporting children without due process, it would be much better for everyone if Hungary were to review asylum applications under a fair asylum system. Because the Hungarian government has been causing suffering and harm for years,” it added.
A decision published by the ECHR on Tuesday also condemned Greece for failing to protect the rights of a teenage asylum seeker who was left homeless for nearly six months starting in November 2018.
In its ruling, the court noted that the asylum seeker, from Afghanistan, “had been left to fend for himself in an environment that was entirely unsuitable for minors – whether in terms of security, accommodation, hygiene or access to food and care, or in terms of the measures taken to provide for him more generally – and in unacceptably precarious circumstances, given his status as an asylum seeker and unaccompanied minor”.
At the end of 2020, at the urging of the UN, the Greek government ushered in new mechanisms aimed at better protecting unaccompanied children. “The majority of them are now staying in official shelters,” it noted in a 2021 report.
The rulings are the latest pronouncements by the courts over how European countries have treated lone child asylum seekers.
Similar decisions, however, stretch back years and involve several countries; in 2019, for example, the ECHR ruled that France had subjected an 11-year-old asylum seeker to inhuman or degrading treatment by failing to provide care for him.
He instead lived in a shantytown in Calais in what the court described as “overcrowded conditions without even the most basic sanitation”.
The environment, it added, was “completely unsuited to his status as a child and in a situation of insecurity rendered unacceptable by his young age”.
Last month a British high court order banned the UK’s Home Office from routinely placing unaccompanied child asylum seekers in hotels. Since June 2021, more than 400 children had gone missing from asylum hotels. Officials recently told a parliamentary committee that 132 of them remain missing."
5378,real,ANTI_MIGRATION_AND_XENOPHOBIA,2024-10-07,"A handful of Senate Republicans are warning that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are siphoning taxpayer funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), meant for Americans in need following natural disasters, to help migrants newly released into the United States.
“Congress has appropriated over $30 billion to FEMA for Fiscal Year 2024. Your Administration has spent over $650 million on FEMA’s border-related programs in Fiscal Year 2024. Since taking office, the Biden-Harris Administration has spent around $1.5 billion on FEMA’s border-related programs,” the Senators wrote to Biden and Harris.
The letter, from October 4, reads:
We are concerned that your Administration’s reliance on FEMA to address the ongoing border crisis, under Vice President Harris as ‘border czar,’ has diminished FEMA’s readiness for disaster relief, including hurricane response. [Emphasis added]
The letter, signed by Sens. Roger Marshall (R-KS), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Rand Paul (R-KY), James Lankford (R-OK), and Ron Johnson (R-WI), comes as Americans across six states, including North Carolina, Tennessee, and South Carolina, have been left devastated by Hurricane Helene.
WATCH: Entire House Swept Away by Floodwaters in NC After Hurricane Helene’s Remnants Strike
As a result, Biden and Harris have been blasted for using hundreds of thousands of FEMA funds to aid newly arrived migrants who crossed the southern border and were subsequently released into the U.S. interior.
The group of Senate Republicans are similarly outraged and are asking Biden and Harris to turn over details about FEMA’s southern border-related programs, including how many employees have been transferred to border missions, how much money has been reprogrammed to the border, and what the administration is doing to recover funds that have gone to ineligible migrants.
“On the first day of the Biden-Harris Administration, you took decisive action to open the border and invite the chaos we have seen over the past 3.5 years. You ended Remain in Mexico, stopped deporting illegal immigrants, and terminated border wall construction. Over 8.4 million migrants have been encountered since you took those actions to open the border,” the Senators write:
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) set multiple records for the most encounters in a single day and in a single month during your Administration. We have repeatedly asked you, your Cabinet, and officials across the Federal government what the plan is for addressing this historic border crisis. By March 2021, FEMA was already mobilized to address the surge of unaccompanied minors after your Administration exempted them from the Title 42 order. As your Administration began planning for the end of the Title 42 order, we learned that you had placed a senior FEMA official as the senior coordinating official for your response to impending surge. [Emphasis added]
Since the end of the Title 42 order, FEMA has continued to play a role in addressing the ongoing border crisis through the Emergency Food and Shelter Program (EFSP) and through the Shelter and Services Program (SSP). These programs have supported the US Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) ‘Plan for Southwest Border Security and Preparedness,’ which calls for FEMA to ‘bolster[…] the capacity of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to receive noncitizens after they have been processed by CBP and are awaiting the results of their immigration removal proceedings. And … coordination with and support for state, local, and community leaders to help mitigate increased impacts to their communities.’ Oversight from the DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) found that some illegal aliens who were ineligible for EFSP and SSP funding ended up receiving benefits funded by these programs. All told, FEMA has received $1.7 billion for its southern border response efforts. Emblematic of this Administration’s approach, one FEMA official informed my Subcommittee staff during a site visit that the Biden-Harris border crisis is like a hurricane: ‘FEMA can buy its way out of the border crisis if Congress allocates it enough money.’ [Emphasis added]
At the same time, the Senators note, the Biden-Harris administration has “regularly requested that Congress cut detention beds and funding for border enforcement measures” while at the same time requesting that a continued flow of taxpayer money go to FEMA’s border-related programs.
“Rather than ensuring FEMA is ready to respond to hurricanes and other emergencies, FEMA has been pulled into a border crisis mission,” the Senators write. “FEMA’s mission is ‘helping people before, during, and after disasters,’ not helping DHS clean up the impact of your Administration’s reckless border policies.”
“We are very concerned that FEMA’s role at the border has impacted its readiness and preparation efforts for Hurricane Helene and its response efforts,” they continue.

5614,fake,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-09-18,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on September 18 that Kyiv has ""fully prepared"" its ""victory plan"" to end the war with Russia and the most important thing now is the determination to implement it.
All points of the plan have been ""worked out,"" Zelenskiy said in his evening address.
""There is and cannot be any alternative to peace, any freezing of the war or any other manipulations that will simply move Russian aggression to another stage. We need reliable and long-term security for Ukraine, and therefore for all of Europe,"" the president said.
The Ukrainian leader said last week that he planned to discuss the plan with U.S. President Joe Biden this month. He also said he would present it to U.S. presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Zelenskiy is expected to be in the United States next week for the UN General Assembly meeting.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has dragged on for more than 30 months, and Zelenskiy's announcement came as Ukraine controls parts of Russia's Kursk region and as Moscow has pressed an advance into eastern Ukraine.
Zelenskiy added that ""there cannot be any alternative to peace, any freezing of the war or any other manipulations that will simply move the Russian aggression to another stage. We need reliable and lasting security for Ukraine, and therefore for the whole of Europe.""
Zelenskiy has said he aims to host another international peace summit outlining his vision to end the war in November, and that Russia is to be invited.
His comments came after a suspected Ukrainian strike reportedly involving more than 100 drones rocked Russia's Tver region after an arms depot was hit and set off a string of violent explosions and caused a fire 6 kilometers wide.
Emergency services launched a partial evacuation of local residents on September 18 hours after the overnight strike that appeared to target Toropets, a town about 400 kilometers west of Moscow that hosts two Russian military units and an arms depot.
The Astra Telegram channel and other social media published videos that showed massive explosions and flames erupting into the night sky near the town of Toropets, located in the west of the Tver region. Other footage posted on social media showed rows of apartment buildings in the town with windows blown out from blast waves.
Footage later posted on social media showed large plumes of smoke rising from the scene and rows of apartment buildings in Toropets with windows blown out from blast waves.
RFE/RL's Schemes project received satellite images from Planet Labs showing smoke over the territory of Toropets.
Earlier, satellite imagery from NASA showed multiple heat sources from the location and earthquake monitoring stations picked up seismic waves equal to a minor earthquake.
Tver regional Governor Igor Rudenya was quoted by the local government as saying in the afternoon that no deaths or serious injuries had been reported as a result of the incident, which he earlier said was caused when debris from a downed drone sparked a fire. He also said evacuated residents were being allowed to return home and all public services and infrastructure were operational.
""The air-defense system worked, the UAVs were shot down, and a fire occurred when they fell,"" Rudenya wrote on Telegram around 3:30 a.m. local time, without saying what was burning. Rudenya said Russian air defenses were working to repel a ""massive drone attack.""
RFE/RL's Ukraine Live Briefing gives you the latest developments on Russia's invasion, Western military aid, the plight of civilians, and territorial control maps. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.
Reports indicated that the town is home to two Russian military units, one of which has been targeted by drone strikes twice in the past six months. Russia’s state news agency RIA Novosti reported in 2018 that an arms depot was being constructed in Toropets, which has a population of around 11,000 people.
While Kyiv has not officially commented on the incident, a source in Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service on condition of anonymity that the SBU in cooperation with Ukraine's Intelligence and Special Operations Force launched the attack and ""wiped the depot off the face of the Earth."" The source said the depot stored Iskander and Tochka-U tactical missile systems, antiaircraft missiles, and artillery ammunition.
""The SBU, together with its counterparts from the Defense Forces, continues to methodically reduce the enemy's missile potential, which it uses to destroy Ukrainian cities,"" the source said.
Other reports cited Ukrainian intelligence sources saying the arms depot held significant stocks of ballistic missiles obtained by Russia from North Korea as well as glide bombs, and that an area 6 kilometers wide was engulfed in flames.
Russian state media reported early in the morning that kindergartens and schools were temporarily closed in the Zapadnodvinsk district, which borders the Toropetsk district in the Tver region, without indicating why.
Residents of the village of Tsikarevo, which is located along a lake to the east of Toropets and only 200 meters from the arms depot, were initially experiencing difficulties being evacuated and were awaiting help. RFE/RL's North Realities reported that locals had written on local chat groups that safe access was only possible by boat and that ""there was nothing left of the village.""
One local wrote that people were stranded on the water waiting for help, and described seeing minor damage to homes in neighboring villages. Another, however, said that he had become ""homeless.""
Russia's Defense Ministry has not specifically commented on the incident, saying only that 54 Ukrainian drones had targeted five western Russian regions overnight and that all of the drones had been destroyed.
The Defense Ministry, without mentioning the Tver region, said half the drones had been shot down over the Kursk region, where Russian forces have launched a counterattack to push out Ukrainian forces that entered the region and took control of large swaths of Russian territory in a surprise incursion in August.
The rest of the drones, according to the Russian Defense Ministry, were shot down over the Bryansk, Smolensk, Oryol, and Belgorod regions.
Regional authorities in the western Smolensk region bordering Belarus and in the Bryansk region bordering Ukraine also said drones had been shot down.
Kyiv has previously said its strikes against Russia are intended to hit military, energy, and transportation infrastructure that are key to Russia's ongoing attack on Ukraine.
Meanwhile in Ukraine, Russian drone and missile strikes targeted energy facilities in the northeastern city of Sumy. One person was killed in Kropyvnytskiy, the capital of the Kirovohrad region in central Ukraine."

SHENGJIN, Albania (AP) — Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni traveled to Albania on Wednesday to thank its government for its unique role in agreeing to host thousands of asylum-seekers while Italy processes their claims, and to tour migrant centers she said will be ready in August.
Meloni denied her day trip was a campaign stop on the eve of the European Parliament election in which migration is a big issue, and blasted criticism of the visit as typical opposition maneuvering.
Meloni and Albania’s Prime Minister Edi Rama in November signed a five-year deal in which Albania agreed to shelter up to 3,000 migrants rescued from international waters each month while Italy processes their asylum claims. With asylum requests expected to take around a month to process, the number of asylum-seekers sent to Albania could reach up to 36,000 in a year.
“They (Italians) are grateful to the government, they are grateful to the Albanian people for this important effort of friendship that they are making to give us a hand,” Meloni told a news conference.
Albania is not a European Union member, and the idea of sending asylum seekers outside the bloc is controversial. The deal was endorsed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as an example of “out-of-the-box thinking,” but has been widely criticized by rights groups who warn that refugee protections could be compromised.
Meloni has defended the “extremely innovative” plan as a necessary component of her crackdown on migration, aiming to deter would-be refugees from paying smugglers to make the dangerous Mediterranean crossing.
She said the deal has attracted the interest of 15 out of 27 EU members who are asking the European Commission if “the union (could) follow the Italian model in the agreement with Albania.”
“The most useful element of this project is that it can represent an extraordinary tool of deterrence for illegal migrants destined to reach Europe,” she said.
Meloni, accompanied by Interior Minister Matteo Piantendosi, kicked off her visit to the Western Balkan nation at Gjader, a former military airport 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of the capital, Tirana, where work for one of the two migrant centers has started.
Meloni next visited the port of Shengjin, 20 kilometers (12 miles) southwest of Gjader, where a reception center with housing units and offices is set in an area covering 4,000 square meters (4,800 square yards) and surrounded by a 5-meter (yard) high metal fence with barbed wire on top.
Meloni confirmed a two-month delay in the opening of the centers, saying that was due to unforeseen structural reinforcements that were necessary at one of the sites. She said that on Aug. 1 both centers would be operational and ready to host the first 1,000 migrants. A regular ferry link to Italy will begin in mid-September.
Meloni and her right-wing allies have long demanded European countries share more of the migration burden, and have held up the Albania agreement as an innovative solution to a problem that has vexed the EU for years.
Meloni, of the far-right Brothers of Italy party, has also championed her so-called Mattei Plan to fund projects in African countries along migrant routes in exchange for better controls.
At the end of the news conference Riccardo Magi, an Italian parliamentarian of the liberal +Europe party, who was part of the visiting group, tried to block Rama’s and Meloni’s convoys, physically clashing with bodyguards and saying the deal was a failure from the start and politically exploited by Meloni. Meloni stopped and exchanged words with him.
The two processing centers in Albania will cost Italy 670 million euros (about $730 million) over five years. The cost of taking 36,000 migrants to Italy is 136 million euros ($148 million), almost the same as the amount to be spent in Albania, according to Meloni.
The facilities would be fully run by Italy while it fast-tracks migrants’ asylum requests. Both centers are under Italian jurisdiction while Albanian guards will provide outside security.
Italy would welcome the migrants if they are granted international protection or organize their deportation from Albania if refused.
Those picked up within Italy’s territorial waters, or by rescue ships operated by nongovernmental organizations, would retain their right under international and EU law to apply for asylum in Italy and have their claims processed there.
Data from the Italian Interior Ministry show the number of migrants arriving in Italy is way down compared to the same period last year: As of Tuesday, 21,574 people had arrived in Italy via boat so far this year, compared to 51,628 during the same period in 2023.
Rama, of Albania’s left-wing governing Socialist Party, has said the deal is a sign of gratitude on behalf of Albanians who found refuge in Italy and “escaped hell and imagined a better life” following the collapse of communism in the 1990s Albania.
“Italy has been helpful and served Albania many many times and if we have the possibility to be helpful to Italy ... let’s exploit this opportunity,” said Rama.
Tirana has refused other countries’ requests for deals similar to that of Italy, according to Rama.
Italy’s center-left opposition has called the deal an expensive exercise in propaganda ahead of European elections and a shameful bid to turn Albania into Italy’s “Guantánamo.”
A group of 30 Albanian opposition conservative lawmakers took the case to the Constitutional Court in an unsuccessful effort to block the Italy-Albania deal on the grounds of human rights.

2304,fake,ANTI_MIGRATION_AND_XENOPHOBIA,2024-02-01,"President Biden offered a deal on the border to congressional Republicans that they could refuse. To their credit, they did.
The president, speaking from South Carolina, said he would shut down the border “right now,” if Congress passed the proposed bipartisan deal now in front of them.
The proposed deal, Biden said, would “give me as president, the emergency authority to shut down the border until it could get back under control.”
This deal offer is ridiculous on its face. The administration has refused to enforce immigration laws that have been in place for years, but now the president says he will selectively enforce a new law?
Through the first 27 days in December, border authorities “encountered more than 225,000 migrants along the US-Mexico border … marking the highest monthly total recorded since 2000, according to preliminary Homeland Security statistics,” reports CNN.
About 50,000 more arrived at official border crossings. There have been more than 96,000 ""known gotaways"" at the southern border since Oct. 1, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Who knows how many have come into the country with Fentanyl?
Perhaps the most ridiculous suggestion made during what some have rightfully called an “invasion” came from the governor of Boston, Maura Healey, who is asking people to open their homes and businesses to the migrants. This isn’t equivalent to the temporary housing offered to the 7,000 passengers and crew from airplanes forced to land in Newfoundland following the 9/ 11 terrorist attack. Who in their right mind would take in unvetted migrants?
According to the Center for Immigration Studies, there are 11.35 million people living in the U.S. who arrived without documentation. They’re still coming. Why wouldn’t they when so much free stuff awaits?
The political element behind the grand migration is not hard to discern. Democratic megadonor George Soros has made six- figure donations through his Democracy Pac II to a group called Texas Majority PAC, whose goal is to turn Texas into a Democrat-majority state. The group was formed by people associated with Beto O’Rourke, who failed in three attempts to seek various offices.
In a statement, Texas Majority PAC spokeswoman Katherine Fischer said the Soros donations are intended to help the migrants register and turn out voters “on a scale never seen before.” She couldn’t be clearer as to the PAC’s intentions and presumably the goals of other enablers of those who broke our laws to get here.
It appears Vice President Kamala Harris is in on this deal. She wants the migrants to have “a pathway to citizenship.” There is no mystery how she and other Democrats expect most of them to vote should they acquire citizenship. If some of them break more laws after becoming U.S. citizens, what then? Would they get pardoned by the current or a future Democratic president?
As Ronald Reagan said: “A nation that cannot control its borders is not a nation.” Reagan signed a bipartisan, but flawed, immigration bill. This is different and if it continues, the United States of America will be “fundamentally transformed,” which former President Barack Obama and current President Joe Biden have said is their goal.
Uncontrolled immigration has reached the top of the list of voter concerns, ahead of the economy. Voters will decide in November what kind of America they want.
When Benjamin Franklin was supposedly asked what kind of country he had given us, he is said to have replied: “A Republic, if you can keep it.” Whether that quote is true or not is not important. The sentiment is correct. We’ll soon know if we are able to keep it. President Biden – and George Soros – have made their intentions clear."
5645,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-10-14,"Foreign ministers from the European Union have approved new sanctions against seven individuals and seven entities linked to Iran after Kyiv's Western allies accused Tehran of sending ballistic missiles to Russia to aid in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The sanctions, reported in an exclusive by Radio Farda last week, target companies and individuals accused of being involved in the transfer of the weapons to Russia, including the country's flagship carrier Iran Air, as well as airlines Saha Airlines and Mahan Air.
Individuals sanctioned include the deputy defense minister of Iran, Seyed Hamzeh Ghalandari; prominent officials of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps's Quds Force (IRGC-QF); IRGC Khatam al-Anbiya Central Headquarters; and IRGC Aerospace Force Space Division, as well as the managing directors of the EU-listed companies Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industries (HESA) and Aerospace Industries Organization (AIO).
The United States, Britain, France, and Germany accused Iran of sending ballistic missiles and related technology to Russia for use against Ukraine more than a month ago, sparking consultations among European allies on the matter.
""Today’s designation includes individuals and entities responsible for the development and transfer of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), missiles, and related technology to Russia in support of its war of aggression against Ukraine, and to armed groups and entities undermining peace and security in the Middle East and the Red Sea region,"" the council said in a statement on October 14 .
Those targeted are subject to an asset freeze and travel ban to the European Union. Additionally, the provision of funds or economic resources, directly or indirectly, with those listed is prohibited.
Iran Air has direct flights to several cities in Europe, including Frankfurt, Hamburg, Cologne, Paris, and Milan.
The new EU sanctions come just a few days after Peter Stano, the EU's chief foreign policy spokesman, told RFE/RL that he was ""optimistic"" about the EU's relationship with Iran.
Stano stressed that EU relations with Iran ""have been at an all-time low for a long time"" and noted that the most recent reason is Iran's support for Russia in its illegal invasion of Ukraine by supplying drones and more recently missiles.
Domestic repression in Iran, arbitrary detention of EU citizens, and uranium enrichment are other factors that have caused the Islamic republic's relations with the EU to become ""complicated"" and ""sensitive,"" according to Stano."

The administration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris spent over $900 million in taxpayer dollars to fund the “We Can Do This” campaign that promoted the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines to the general public.
This information was made public following the completion of an investigation by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which started in April last year.
Released on Oct. 23, the report sought to explore the failure of the administration’s “We Can Do This” messaging campaign to prevent public trust in the medical establishment from continuing to decline, as highlighted by a July 2023 study in the Annals of Medicine. The study found that just 13.2 percent of children under five and 43.9 percent of youth ages 12-17 were vaccinated for (COVID-19), and that even among those who were just under 40 percent of the younger group and 55.3 percent of those 12-17 were boosted. (Related: Biden regime spent $1B pushing LIES about COVID jabs, boosters and masks, Congress finds.)
The study claimed that the main reasons for non-vaccination were due to parents who were concerned about the side effects of the vaccines (53.3 percent), a lack of trust in the current crop of COVID-19 vaccines (48.7 percent), the belief that children do not need to get vaccinated against COVID-19 (38.8 percent), lack of trust in the government (35.6 percent) and that children in the household were not members of high-risk groups (32.8 percent).
To counter this, the Biden-Harris administration conducted what the House Energy and Commerce Committee described as a “deeply flawed” campaign based on data and advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that only exacerbated mistrust in the government and COVID-19 vaccines.
Among the medical misinformation it promoted were claims that the COVID-19 vaccines effectively stopped viral transmission, exaggerations of the effectiveness of masking and exaggerations of the risk the virus posed to children, which in reality was almost nonexistent.
The campaign also relied on celebrity advertisements to promote the vaccines and full-time social media influencers to do similar promotions directly to their audiences, reportedly with little success.
The campaign also worked to “regularly synthesize findings from Google search trends and monitor social listening tools … to recommend, develop, shepherd through clearance and traffic a range of timely static and video ads” on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter (now X), Reddit and YouTube.
“While the Biden-Harris administration’s public health guidance led to prolonged closures of schools and businesses, the NIH [National Institutes of Health] was spending nearly a billion dollars of taxpayer money trying to manipulate Americans with advertisements – sometimes containing erroneous or unproven information,” wrote House Energy And Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) in a statement.
“By overpromising what the COVID-19 vaccines could do – in direct contradiction of the Food and Drug Administration‘s authorizations – and over-emphasizing the virus’ risk to children and young adults, the Biden-Harris administration caused Americans to lose trust in the public health system,” she added.
“Our investigation also uncovered the extent to which public funding went to Big Tech companies to track and monitor Americans, underscoring the need for stronger online data privacy protections.”

3671,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-10-14,"- Researchers say males and females respond differently to their breakfast choices.
- Males do better with high-carbohydrate breakfasts.
- However, females have a better metabolic response to higher-fat breakfasts.
- Differences in muscle, hormones, and nutrient needs may play a role.
- Personalized nutrition based on metabolism can aid in weight loss, energy, and health.
An October 2024 study published in Computers in Biology and Medicine suggests what males and females eat for breakfast can affect them in very different ways.
The researchers found that males do best with carb-rich breakfasts.
Females, on the other hand, had a better metabolic response to a breakfast heavy in fat.
The researchers suggested that these differences could be used to tailor people’s diets to their needs, helping to support weight loss and improve energy.
The team reached this conclusion after creating a mathematical model of metabolisms for both males and females.
The model included feeding and fasting scenarios in healthy young people.
It additionally addressed metabolic responses to both high-carbohydrate and high fat meals at the organ and whole-body levels.
Specifically, they modeled the activities of the brain, heart, skeletal muscle, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and adipose tissue (fat).
The study’s stated goal was to examine how carbohydrates and fats are metabolized throughout the body and in the various organs.
They also wanted to learn more about what might be driving the metabolic differences.
The authors said the purpose of creating a mathematical model was to use existing data to quickly test hypotheses and refine studies without having to conduct more involved human studies.
Research like this helps bridge a gap in the scientific literature, the authors wrote, explaining that more tends to be known about metabolic responses to food in males.
Examining gender differences in metabolism can help us learn more about customizing nutrition recommendations for the unique needs of females.
Catherine Gervacio, a Registered Nutritionist-Dietitian and a certified exercise nutrition coach with WOWMD, who was not a part of the study, said one reason that males and females respond differently is that males tend to have more muscle mass.
She said this means men tend to use carbohydrates for quick energy, while females tend to use more body fat.
The result is that a female’s long-term energy reserve burns fats more efficiently, according to Gervacio.
“This means men usually rely on carbs for energy, especially during activities, while women’s bodies are better at using fat, especially in times of rest or fasting,” she explained.
Hormonal differences can also play a role, per Gervacio.
“Hormones like estrogen in women promote fat storage and fat burning, particularly during fasting or when energy is needed over a longer time,” she said. “On the other hand, men’s hormones, such as testosterone, support more muscle growth, so their metabolism is more geared toward breaking down carbs for immediate energy.”
Finally, Gervacio pointed to the different energy and nutrient needs of males versus females.
“Due to different muscle-to-fat ratios and how organs use energy, men’s and women’s bodies prioritize different nutrients,” she said. “This results in women being more efficient at conserving and using fats for energy, while men’s bodies burn through carbs faster for quick bursts of energy.”
Akanksha Kulkarni, a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist at Prowise Healthcare, who was also not involved in the study, explained that differences in biological sex, hormones, age, and physical activity must all be taken into account, whether you are looking to lose weight or simply to have more energy and better health.
For example, weight loss diets for males might be higher in complex carbohydrates, while females might incorporate more healthy oils.
“Custom nutrition helps people gradually adjust and tailor their meals to provide lasting energy,” she said.
Finally, Kulkarni said that personalized nutrition, especially if it is derived from analyzing the individual metabolic profile, could improve a person’s overall health.
“Taking into account the gender aspects of the metabolism helps with controlling the degree of inflammatory response and blood sugar levels in a better way and managing excess body weight successfully in the future, which translates to better health,” she concluded.
A new study using a mathematical model has found that males and females have different metabolic responses to their breakfast choices.
Males responded more favorably to carbohydrate-rich breakfasts.
Females, however, responded better to breakfasts higher in fat.
Experts say factors such as differences in muscle mass, hormones, and nutrient needs can all play a role in a person’s metabolic responses to food.
However, personalized nutrition plans that take this into account can help people lose weight, have more energy, and have better overall health."
2488,real,INSTITUTIONAL_AND_MEDIA_DISTRUST_PUBLIC_INSTITUTIONS,2024-03-25,"Negotiations run until Thursday with nations trying to hammer out an agreement to make sure the world is better prepared to deal with the next pandemic -- or better still, stamp it out before it happens.
Shaken by Covid-19, which shredded economies, overturned societies, crippled health systems and millions killed, countries decided in December 2021 to build a framework of binding commitments to stop such trauma from ever happening again.
But as two years of talks come to the crunch, major sticking points remain.
The ninth and final negotiations round opened on March 18, with daily talks ploughing on late into the evening.
Diplomats insist they remain keen to conclude an agreement, but the various alliances still seem far apart.
World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has repeatedly warned nations that ""everyone will have to give something, or no one will get anything.""
'Critical for humanity'
European countries -- who led calls for a pandemic treaty -- want more money invested in pandemic prevention, while African nations want the knowledge and financing to make that work, plus proper access to pandemic ""counter-measures"" like vaccines and treatments.
The United States wants to ensure all countries share data and samples from emerging outbreaks quickly and transparently, while developing countries are holding out firm for guaranteed equity to stop them getting left behind.
A finalised accord on pandemic preparedness, prevention and response is aimed to be adopted at the May 27 to June 1 World Health Assembly of the WHO's 194 member states.
But there is a sense in diplomatic circles that developing nations are growing weary of Western obduracy and extra talks in April may be needed to cross the line.
Tedros said Monday that countries were ""making progress, but there are still areas of difference that need further negotiation.
""None of them are insurmountable. If countries listen to each other's concerns, I am confident they can find common ground"".
""The second major barrier is the litany of lies and conspiracy theories about the agreement,"" he added, slamming ""deliberate deception that puts at risk the health of future generations"".
No time to 'chicken out'
The main topics still in play include access to emerging pathogens, better prevention and monitoring of disease outbreaks, reliable financing and transferring technology to poorer countries.
The talks are being conducted by an Intergovernmental Negotiating Body co-chaired by Roland Driece of the Netherlands and South Africa's Precious Matsoso.
Opening the final talks round, Driece said many countries now thought reaching agreement would be ""difficult"", and the draft was ""not really what we like"".
""It's time to find compromises,"" he added.
Matsoso put it succinctly: ""You can't chicken out now.""
Success or failure in the next pandemic may heavily depend on the pharmaceutical industry coming up with the necessary vaccines, tests and treatments -- and crucially, how they are then distributed.
Thomas Cueni, director general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, said any accord would be ""meaningless"" if companies were being strongarmed.
""It only works if it's voluntary and based on mutually-agreed terms,"" he told AFP.
The IFPMA chief said there had been unprecedented voluntary tech transfer during Covid, and ""if this is created the wrong way, I'm afraid that this would put big barriers and disincentives next time round"".
'Lowest common denominator'
Non-governmental organisations have major concerns over the way the agreement text is heading.
K.M. Gopakumar, senior researcher with the Third World Network, surmised that in return for binding commitments on sharing pathogens, developing countries wanted equally-binding proposals ""to share the benefits emerging out of these pathogens: vaccines, diagnostics"".
He said there had been ""systematic sidelining of equity-related provisions in the pandemic instrument"".
He said phrases like ""parties shall promote"" mean that ""nothing is concrete"".
Rachael Crockett from the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative said there was a risk of a rushed deal that ""could leave us with the lowest common denominator"".
Ultimately, senior WHO figures have been trying to remind countries why nations wanted a treaty in the first place.
WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said the accord would be a promise to future generations.
""The outcome really matters,"" he said Thursday.
""This isn't some dusty old document that will sit on a shelf somewhere. This treaty will save lives.""

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz with President Joe Biden at a bilateral meeting during the G7 summit in June 2022. [EPA-EFE/Sean Gallup / POOL] Euractiv is part of the Trust Project >>> Languages: DeutschPrint Email Facebook X LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram With the US still failing to unblock aid for Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz stressed on Thursday (8 February) that both Brussels and Washington must do more to send a “very clear signal” to Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Ahead of his departure to Washington, Scholz re-emphasised the urgency of upholding and enhancing support for Ukraine in its defensive efforts against Russia’s war of aggression. While EU leaders last week unlocked a €50 billion long-term funding package for Kyiv, a US bipartisan deal on Ukraine aid failed to garner sufficient support from Republican senators yesterday, prolonging the blockade which continues to shackle Ukraine’s biggest donor. “Now is the moment to send a very clear signal to (…) the Russian president that he cannot count on our support waning,” Scholz told reporters in Berlin. Europe and America would “have to find a way to do more together”, he stressed, emphasising that “what has been earmarked in Europe and by the resolutions of the [US] Congress is still not enough”. He added that “what is at stake is how Europe but also the United States may stabilise their support for Ukraine”. It is a message that he will bring to a dinner with lawmakers from the House of Representatives and the Senate, scheduled for tonight. While the exact list of attendants has not been confirmed, the leaders of both chambers of Congress as well as the main lawmakers for foreign and defence policy are invited. In his meeting with US President Joe Biden on Friday, Scholz is expected to stress the urgency of the situation and alleviate US concerns about bearing the brunt, a senior government official said. Germany “should not overestimate [its] influence in Washington”, pointing to the domestic bargaining behind the blockade, they said, asked by Euractiv. “I believe what we can do during this visit is to emphasise once again the great necessity of continuing military support for Ukraine,” the official noted. Scholz would make it “clear to the American audience that it does not stand alone with its aid, but that us Europeans are doing our part and that we see this as a joint transatlantic challenge”, they said. Trump’s return looms large Previously, Scholz had also rallied European countries to contribute more in military aid – though there have been calls on Scholz himself, too, to provide Ukraine with German Taurus missiles, which he has so far been reluctant to follow. The potential return of former Republican President Donald Trump to office looms large over his visit, as it could have decisive implications for support for Ukraine. Should Biden’s re-election bid fail in November, the trip could be among Scholz’s last bilateral meetings with Biden. Trump has previously been critical of American support for Ukraine, vowing last year to end the war “in one day, 24 hours” if elected. The priority that the chancellor has assigned to this opportunity for close coordination with Biden ahead of the American election campaign became evident from Scholz’s schedule, which prioritises additional time for talks with the American president over a final press statement, which has still not been confirmed. Beyond coordination on aid for Ukraine, Scholz and Biden will also discuss the upcoming NATO summit in July. Moreover, the senior official expected the tense situation in the Middle East and progress towards a two-state solution – backed by both America and Germany – to play a role as well.

The accord – conceived during Covid to prevent and respond to pandemics – will top the agenda at the World Health Assembly
Global health leaders will gather in Geneva on 27 May at the annual World Health Assembly, where a new agreement for countries to work together to prepare for, prevent, and respond to pandemics – known as the “pandemic accord” – will top the agenda.
It was first proposed by world leaders in early 2021, with a promise to avoid the mistakes of the Covid-19 pandemic next time around.
Talks are likely to go down to the wire, and a finished text may not be ready by the assembly deadline. But those involved say this is an opportunity to make the world safer – and fairer – that humanity cannot afford to miss."
3725,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-08-14,"A woman fighting a landmark LGBTQ+ custody battle in China said she “still has faith for the future” after winning the right to make monthly visits to her daughter.
Last month, Didi, who is 42 and lives in Shanghai, travelled to Beijing to visit her seven-year-old daughter, who lives in the capital with Didi’s estranged wife and their other child. It was the first time Didi and her daughter had seen each other in four years.
A court in Beijing said in May that she should be allowed monthly visits with the child that she gave birth to in 2017. “I think maybe she still remembers me,” said Didi, who asked to be referred to by her nickname for privacy reasons. She said that the separation had been “heartbreaking”.
The visitation agreement from Beijing Fengtai people’s court is the first time that a court in China has recognised that a child can have two legal mothers, and has been hailed as a milestone by LGBTQ+ campaigners.
However, Didi has not been granted contact with her son, the girl’s brother, highlighting the difficulty faced by Chinese courts in handling LGBTQ+ family arrangements.
Didi’s prolonged and unusual legal battle to gain shared custody of her children is part of a lawsuit that marks the first time that a court in China has been forced to consider how to handle same-sex parents.
Same-sex unions are not legally recognised in China. But the recent development in Didi’s case is “very important”, said an LGBTQ+ activist based outside China who asked to remain anonymous. They said it was significant because it marks the first time that a court has recognised that a child can have two mothers.
Didi and her wife married in the US in 2016. Later that year, they underwent IVF treatment, with embryos made from the wife’s eggs and donor sperm implanted in both women.
In 2017, Didi gave birth to a girl and her wife gave birth to a boy. Both children are genetically linked only to Didi’s ex. “We were creating new life … I didn’t imagine that one day we would break up,” Didi said.
But back in China, the relationship broke down and in 2019 the couple separated (they are still legally married in the US). Didi’s wife took the two children to live with her in the capital and cut off contact with Didi.
In March 2020, Didi sued for custody of the toddlers, in what was China’s first same-sex custody dispute. Four years later, she has won a victory.
A bittersweet ‘big step forward’
Chinese law has an “avoidance approach” to gay relationships, said Gao Mingyue, Didi’s lawyer. It “does not clearly define the rights of same-sex couples”.
China’s civil code and marriage law assumes that a child will be born to a heterosexual, married household.
Although there are provisions for adoption and step-parents, there is no mechanism for dealing with the “shared motherhood” approach that lesbian couples sometimes use to have children, in which an embryo made with one woman’s egg is implanted into the uterus of the other woman, who carries and gives birth to the child. Birth certificates assume that the woman who gives birth to a baby is her biological mother.
Because Didi gave birth to her daughter, despite not being genetically related to her, she had some grounds to argue that she was a rightful mother. She has little chance of being legally recognised as a guardian to the girl’s brother. “I really love both my children, I want to look after them,” she said.
Since China abandoned its one child policy and now is encouraging people to have more babies rather than fewer, courts are increasingly inclined to protect the rights of children born out of wedlock, including to LGBTQ+ households and single parents, according to Gao.
“But for the same-sex couples themselves … it’s getting more and more difficult,” Gao said. “The courts are still not protecting the covenants and arrangements between couples.”
In 2019, a campaign to push for the legalisation of same-sex marriage in China’s new civil code led to more than 200,000 submissions being made in a public consultation. The campaign failed, but prompted a government spokesperson to make a rare public acknowledgment of interest in the topic.
A survey published in July by the Williams Institute at UCLA found that of the nearly 3,000 respondents, 85% had favourable attitudes towards the idea of same-sex parents. Nearly 90% supported the idea of same-sex marriage. With Chinese society increasingly tolerant of LGBTQ+ people, “the law should catch up”, said the activist.
For Didi, the fact that she has won a minor victory with regards to her daughter, but nothing with regards to her son, makes the moment bittersweet. But her lawyer, Gao, said that it is a “big step forward”.
The case has been widely discussed on Chinese social media and in academic circles, and it sets a precedent of two mothers sharing parental custody, he said.
Didi hopes that as China becomes more socially permissive, the legal system will also start to recognise same-sex households, even if only through incremental steps. “It’s very simple,” she said, “other families have one father and one mother. We have two mothers.”

5201,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-10-07,"When Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun discovered a new molecule they called microRNA in the 1980s, it was a fascinating diversion from what for decades had been called the central dogma of molecular biology.
Recognized with the 2024 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine, Ambros and Ruvkun had identified a new kind of genetic material that transformed how researchers understood gene regulation.
Like DNA, RNA is a form of genetic material made from individual nucleotides linked into chains. According to the central dogma, genetic information flows in one direction: DNA is transcribed into RNA, and RNA is translated into proteins. But in one major deviation from the central dogma, some RNAs are never translated or coded into proteins.
MicroRNA is one type of these so-called noncoding RNAs. They’re short stretches of genetic material that, rather than coding for a specific protein themselves, control the RNAs that do code for proteins. In effect, microRNAs turn particular genes on and off.
I dedicated my scientific career to understanding how RNA works, in part because research on RNA has lagged behind other macromolecules like DNA and proteins. The Nobel Prize recognition of microRNA molecules marks both their importance in biology and their promise as potential treatments for various diseases, including cancer.
MicroRNAs and disease
Scientists regard microRNAs as master regulators of the genome due to their ability to bind to and alter the expression of many protein-coding RNAs. Indeed, a single microRNA can regulate anywhere from 10 to 100 protein-coding RNAs. Rather than translating DNA to proteins, they instead can bind to protein-coding RNAs to silence genes.
The reason microRNAs can regulate such a diverse pool of RNAs stems from their ability to bind to target RNAs they don’t perfectly match up with. This means a single microRNA can often regulate a pool of targets that are all involved in similar processes in the cell, leading to an enhanced response.
Because a single microRNA can regulate multiple genes, many microRNAs can contribute to disease when they become dysfunctional.
In 2002, researchers first identified the role dysfunctional microRNAs play in disease through patients with a type of blood and bone marrow cancer called chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This cancer results from the loss of two microRNAs normally involved in blocking tumor cell growth. Since then, scientists have identified over 2,000 microRNAs in people, many of which are altered in various diseases.
The field has developed a fairly solid understanding of how microRNA dysfunction contributes to disease. Changing one microRNA can change several other genes, resulting in a plethora of alterations that can collectively reshape the cell’s physiology. For example, over half of all cancers have significantly reduced activity in a microRNA called miR-34a. Because miR-34a regulates many genes involved in preventing the growth and migration of cancer cells, losing miR-34a can increase the risk of developing cancer.
Researchers are looking into using microRNAs as therapeutics for cancer, heart disease, neurodegenerative disease and others. While results in the laboratory have been promising, bringing microRNA treatments into the clinic has met multiple challenges. Many are related to inefficient delivery into target cells and poor stability, which limit their effectiveness.
Delivering microRNA to cells
One reason why delivering microRNA treatments into cells is difficult is because microRNA treatments need to be delivered specifically to diseased cells while avoiding healthy cells. Unlike mRNA COVID-19 vaccines that are taken up by scavenging immune cells whose job is to detect foreign materials, microRNA treatments need to fool the body into thinking they aren’t foreign in order to avoid immune attack and get to their intended cells.
Scientists are studying various ways to deliver microRNA treatments to their specific target cells. One method garnering a great deal of attention relies on directly linking the microRNA to a ligand, a kind of small molecule that binds to specific proteins on the surface of cells. Compared with healthy cells, diseased cells can have a disproportionate number of some surface proteins, or receptors. So, ligands can help microRNAs home specifically to diseased cells while avoiding healthy cells. The first ligand approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to deliver small RNAs like microRNAs, N-acetylgalactosamine, or GalNAc, preferentially delivers RNAs to liver cells.
Identifying ligands that can deliver small RNAs to other cells requires finding receptors expressed at high enough levels on the surface of target cells. Typically, over one million copies per cell are needed in order to achieve sufficient delivery of the drug.
One ligand that stands out is folate, also referred to as vitamin B9, a small molecule critical during periods of rapid cell growth such as fetal development. Because some tumor cells have over one million folate receptors, this ligand provides sufficient opportunity to deliver enough of a therapeutic RNA to target different types of cancer. For example, my laboratory developed a new molecule called FolamiR-34a – folate linked to miR-34a – that reduced the size of breast and lung cancer tumors in mice.
Making microRNAs more stable
One of the other challenges with using small RNAs is their poor stability, which leads to their rapid degradation. As such, RNA-based treatments are generally short-lived in the body and require frequent doses to maintain a therapeutic effect.
To overcome this challenge, researchers are modifying small RNAs in various ways. While each RNA requires a specific modification pattern, successful changes can significantly increase their stability. This reduces the need for frequent dosing, subsequently decreasing treatment burden and cost.
For example, modified GalNAc-siRNAs, another form of small RNAs, reduces dosing from every few days to once every six months in nondividing cells. My team developed folate ligands linked to modified microRNAs for cancer treatment that reduced dosing from once every other day to once a week. For diseases like cancer where cells are rapidly dividing and quickly diluting the delivered microRNA, this increase in activity is a significant advancement in the field. We anticipate this accomplishment will facilitate further development of this folate-linked microRNA as a cancer treatment in the years to come.
Many labs are working to develop treatments based on the discoveries new Nobel laureates Ambros and Ruvkun made decades ago. While there’s still considerable work to be done to overcome the hurdles associated with microRNA treatments, it’s clear that RNA shows promise as a therapeutic for many diseases.

3000,fake,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-01-03,"How The Associated Press could admit to being financed by eco-extremist donors and yet still claim to be neutral when it comes to its climate change reporting defies common sense.
The AP website lists as one of its “current philanthropic supporters” the “KR Foundation,” which boasts of how it’s “[s]upporting a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels.” The organization, which is based in Denmark, is financing the equivalent of roughly $300,000 USD to AP spread out between the years 2022 and 2024 for its Global Scholars Network.
The Washington Free Beacon, which first broke the news, noted that despite AP’s false veneer of transparency, “the news outlet added the KR Foundation to its list of current philanthropic supporters only this month, according to a Washington Free Beacon review of the AP website.”
MRC Business revealed in a 2023 analysis how AP’s multimillion-dollar funding from leftist special interest groups had effectively made it a propaganda arm of the climate change lobby.
If KR’s climate alarmist goal wasn’t telling enough, KR is also specifically leading an effort to drive U.S. banks out of fossil fuels. It particularly bemoaned how the rise of the “anti-ESG” movement was allegedly causing “many financial institutions to backpedal on their climate ambitions.” How dare Americans not want gargantuan asset managers forcing companies to adopt woke, leftist corporate policies.
But that’s not all. Consider this eco-charged rant from KR on its website:
We aim to reduce both supply and demand for fossil fuels by supporting organizations that challenge the ongoing financing of fossil fuels, challenge the social and political influence of the fossil fuel industry, and by supporting the transition to a sustainable economic paradigm.
AP has the audacity to prop itself up as an “independent” outlet in the business of “unbiased news” read by reportedly four billion people each day. Completely pathetic. The Society of Professional Journalists Code of Ethics clearly states that journalists should “Avoid conflicts of interest, real or perceived,"" but apparently that cardinal rule was lost on AP leadership.
The news of AP’s source of climate change activist cash comes after MRC Business’s May 2023 study of 64 stories between Feb. 15, 2022, and Feb. 15, 2023, which exposed how AP’s leftist donors have impacted the slant in its coverage of the eco-boogeyman. After receiving an $8 million grant from a consortium of left-wing organizations obsessed with climate change, AP’s coverage morphed into a hodgepodge of mind-numbing alarmism.
The outlet featured headlines like “New abnormal: Climate disaster damage ‘down’ to $268 billion,” which it published Dec. 9, 2022 and peppered its work with climate ideology buzzwords. MRC Business tallied climate alarmist and ESG-related terms in accordance with how many times each term appeared across the articles researched.
The term “Climate Change"" itself appeared a whopping 212 times. “Warming” and “Global Warming” appeared 140 times collectively. “Extreme(s)” emerged 32 times and “Disaster(s)” and “Climate Disaster” appeared a collective 30 times.
AP used a couple of other terms to frame its climate reporting in a way favorable to the left’s narrative: “death sentence,” “net zero,” and “zero.” As a bonus, Free Beacon even pointed out a November 2023 piece that reeked of KR Foundation’s extremist views: “How did humans get to the brink of crashing climate?”
AP continues to make it clear that it isn’t a news outlet in as much as it is a de facto mouthpiece for the humanity-hating, climate fanatic movement.
Conservatives are under attack. Contact the Associated Press at 212-621-1500 and demand it quit acting like a mouthpiece for its eco-extremist donors."
3005,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-04-09,"It is the latest red flag in a year already marked by climate extremes and rising greenhouse gas emissions, spurring fresh calls for more rapid action to limit global warming.
Rolling records
Every month since June 2023 has beaten its own ""hottest ever"" tag -- and March 2024 was no exception.
The EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said that March globally was 1.68 degrees Celsius hotter than an average March between the years 1850-1900, the reference period for the pre-industrial era.
The March record was only broken by 0.1C but it is the broader trend that was more alarming, said Samantha Burgess, deputy director of C3S.
Huge swathes of the planet endured above-average temperatures in March, from parts of Africa to Greenland, South America and Antarctica.
'Borrowed time'
It was not only the tenth consecutive month to break its own heat record, but capped the hottest 12-month period on the books -- 1.58C above pre-industrial averages.
This doesn't mean the 1.5C warming limit agreed by world leaders in Paris in 2015 has been breached -- that is measured in decades, not individual years.
Nonetheless ""the reality is that we're extraordinarily close, and already on borrowed time,"" Burgess told AFP.
The UN's IPCC climate panel has warned that the world will likely crash through 1.5C in the early 2030s.
'Incredibly unusual'
The story at sea was no less ""shocking"", Burgess said, with a new record for global ocean surface temperature set in February eclipsed once again in March.
""That's incredibly unusual,"" she said.
Oceans cover 70 percent of the planet and have kept the Earth's surface liveable by absorbing 90 percent of the excess heat produced by the carbon pollution from human activity since the dawn of the industrial age.
More heat, more rain
Hotter oceans mean more moisture in the atmosphere -- scientists say the air can generally hold around seven percent more water vapour for every 1C of temperature rise.
This leads to increasingly erratic weather, like fierce winds and powerful rain.
Russia is reeling from some of its worst flooding in decades while parts of Australia, Brazil and France experienced an exceptionally wet March.
""We know the warmer our global atmosphere is, the more extreme events we'll have, the worse they will be, the more intense they will be,"" Burgess told AFP.
Heat on the horizon
Copernicus said the cyclical El Nino climate pattern, which warms the sea surface in the Pacific Ocean, leading to hotter weather globally, continued to weaken in March.
But its ""warming effect"" alone did not explain the dramatic spikes witnessed this past year and projections for the coming months still indicated above-average temperatures, Burgess said.
Could this mean more records shattered this year?
""Whilst we continue to see so much heat in the surface ocean -- so in the sea surface temperatures -- I think it's highly likely,"" Burgess said.
Bigger question
Copernicus records go back to 1940 but other sources of climate data such as ice cores, tree rings and coral skeletons allow scientists to expand their conclusions using evidence from much deeper in the past.
""We know that the period that we're living in right now is likely to be the warmest that it's been for the last 100,000 years,"" Burgess said.
As climate records tumble, scientists are debating whether the extreme heat seen this past year was within the bounds of what was forecast -- or was something more uncharted.
""Is it a phase change? Is the climate system broken? We don't really understand yet why we have this additional heat in 23/24. We can explain most of it, but not all of it,"" Burgess said.
What had transpired was ""within the envelope"" of scientific forecasts ""but it was the very outer edge of the envelope, rather than the mean or the median where you'd expect it to fall"", she added.
Up and up
Humanity, meanwhile, continues to pump ever-more planet-heating emissions into the atmosphere even as scientists say they need to fall by almost half this decade to keep the Paris goals within reach.
Levels of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide -- the three main human-caused greenhouse gases -- rose for another year in 2023, scientists from the US-based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said on Friday.
""Until we get to net zero, we will continue to see temperatures rise,"" Burgess said.

5956,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-04-05,"The scenario is made more complex by an anticipated Russian offensive by late spring or early summer, which is accompanied by uncertainty about the tactics and regions that would be targeted. Military insiders and generals in Ukraine's armed forces paint a bleak picture, highlighting the daunting prospect of front lines collapsing under the weight of Russian
They emphasize the critical need for effective defense technologies and timely support from Western allies, lamenting the inadequacies that have hampered Ukraine's resistance efforts.
Acknowledging instances of successful defense against Russian incursions, these officers stress the necessity for ongoing innovation and adaptability in the face of evolving threats. They underscore the urgent requirement for essential weaponry, including artillery shells and drones, to sustain the defense against Russian forces.
Efforts from European allies to bolster Ukraine's arsenal, such as the proposed artillery ammunition purchase, provide some relief but fall short of addressing the full extent of Ukraine's needs. Additionally, concerns over manpower shortages persist, with delays in implementing recruitment measures exacerbating the strain on frontline defenses.

The debate over mobilization efforts reflects broader political challenges within Ukraine, with tensions between military imperatives and domestic considerations complicating strategic decision-making.
Despite reassurances from military leadership, skepticism remains regarding the adequacy of manpower preparations in anticipation of a potential escalation in hostilities.
The long-awaited counteroffensive against Russia last year ended in disappointment, marked by Moscow's conquest of Avdiivka, the biggest territorial gain for Russia in nine months. Zelensky has been compelled to silently acknowledge this new military reality.
The administration of President Joe Biden is currently pivoting toward a strategy of sustaining Ukrainian defenses until after the U.S. presidential elections, hoping to exhaust Russian forces in a protracted war of attrition.
While this strategy appears reasonable, it harbors one crucial implication and a potentially disastrous flaw, aspects not yet receiving serious consideration in public discourse in the West or Ukraine.
The implication of Ukraine adopting a prolonged defensive stance, even if successful, is that the territories currently under Russian occupation are effectively lost. Russia is unlikely to yield these lands at the negotiating table after having secured them on the battlefield.
This doesn't imply Ukraine formally surrendering these territories, as that would be politically unfeasible. However, it does imply that, as Zelensky previously suggested regarding Crimea and the eastern Donbas, the territorial issue may need to be deferred for future negotiations. Such negotiations could persist for decades without resolution or escalate into renewed conflict.
For many Ukrainians, especially in private discussions, the acceptance of territorial losses as the price of peace was a pragmatic view, particularly if reclaiming lost lands through military means seemed improbable. Now, this view is gaining popularity.
However, some proponents of complete Ukrainian victory entertain overly optimistic or fantastical hopes.
For instance, the notion of Russia's defeat and expulsion from Crimea through long-range missile bombardment, as proposed by retired U.S. Army General Ben Hodges, is deemed unrealistic.
While Ukraine has achieved some successes against the Russian Black Sea Fleet, retaking Crimea would require a monumental amphibious operation beyond current capabilities.
A more realistic approach suggests that by maintaining a defensive posture this year, Ukrainians could inflict significant losses on Russian forces, potentially enabling a successful counterattack in 2025 with increased Western support.

3960,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-06-13,"AAP FACTCHECK – Posts doing the rounds on social media are claiming the German parliament has voted to decriminalise possession of child sexual abuse content.
This is false. Experts tell AAP FactCheck that possessing child sex abuse material is still a crime in Germany, and a proposed legal change would simply reduce the minimum penalties in some cases.
Facebook users have shared the claim multiple times, as have X (formerly Twitter) users.
Many posts link to an article published on May 22 by The People’s Voice, a known misinformation publisher, with the headline: “Germany Decriminalizes Child Porn As Pro-Pedophile Activists Demand Age of Consent Dropped to 12.”
It features an edited image of World Economic Forum chairman Klaus Schwab and a father attending a Pride event with his daughter.
“Pro-pedophilia activists groups are celebrating following the news that Germany has bowed to the World Economic Forum and decriminalized the possession of child pornography,” the article claims.
It goes on to translate a May 15 German parliamentary press release: “… the bill stipulates that ‘possession and acquisition should be punishable with a minimum penalty of three months’ imprisonment, and distribution with a minimum penalty of six months’ imprisonment … The offenses regulated in Section 184b of the Criminal Code are therefore classified as misdemeanors and not as crimes’.”
The press release in question refers to a proposed amendment to section 184b of Germany‘s criminal code that was passed by the German Bundestag on May 16, 2024.
The draft law is yet to be passed by the Bundesrat, Germany’s upper house.
Experts tell AAP FactCheck that possessing child sexual abuse material would remain a crime under the proposed law.
They say The People’s Voice’s inaccurate translations misinterpret specific German legal terms.
David Albrecht, a German lawyer specialising in criminal law, says the proposed reform in no way decriminalises possessing child sexual abuse material.
“It would remain a criminal offence as it is now … ,” he told AAP FactCheck.
“What it will do is lower the minimum sentence from one year imprisonment to three months (for possession and acquisition) and six months (for distribution).”
Dr Albrecht says The People’s Voice translation of the parliamentary press release is “misleading”, as it doesn’t properly represent the meaning of two important German legal terms.
The first is “verbrechen”, a serious criminal offence punishable by a minimum term of one year in prison.
The second term is “vergehen”, a less serious criminal offence punishable by a lesser minimum term of imprisonment or by a fine.
The German parliament’s translation of the proposed change says possessing child sex abuse material could, in some cases, be considered vergehen, the less serious crime.
Ursus Koerner von Gustorf, a Berlin criminal lawyer specialising in sexual offence cases, says the change would repeal a 2021 amendment that has “caused serious problems in practice”.
“For example, there was the case of a mother who found a photo of child pornography on her son’s cell phone,” Mr von Gustorf told AAP FactCheck.
“To warn other parents at her son’s school, she posted the picture in a chat group. She was subsequently prosecuted and faced more than a year in prison.
“The court found that the sentence could be unconstitutional and asked the federal constitutional court for guidance.”
AAP FactCheck previously debunked a similar claim about child abuse laws in Europe.
The Verdict
The claim that Germany has changed the law to decriminalise the possession of child pornography is false.
Experts tell AAP FactCheck that possessing child sex abuse material remains a crime in Germany, but a proposed legal change would reduce the minimum penalties in some cases.
False – The claim is inaccurate.

But Fetterman says he’ll try again
A congressional scheme by Democrats to send $1 million in tax money to an LGBT “fetish” center in Philadelphia has been derailed … by Democrats.
It was the Libs of TikTok channel on X that had raised questions about the $1 million earmark for the LGBTQ Center “which boasts rooms to try BDSM and s*x f*tishes and hosts BDSM and s*x k*nbk parties…”
BREAKING: The Senate Appropriations Committee released a spending bill which is being voted on tomorrow.
It includes $1M of your tax dollars to go towards renovating an LGBTQ Center in PA which boasts rooms to try BDSM and s*x f*tishes and hosts BDSM and s*x k*nk parties.… pic.twitter.com/PKkj6TEd2q
— Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) March 5, 2024
As a result, a letter from Democratic senators John Fetterman and Bob Casey asked that the money be pulled from a piece of spending legislation pending before Congress.
The Washington Times explained, “It was exactly the type of embarrassment Congress hoped to avoid as it took another spin on the cash carousel known on Capitol Hill as earmarking, by which lawmakers redirect some of the usual spending to specific projects in their home states and districts.”
Earmarks, used for years, were banned some years ago by Republicans, then returned by Democrats in 2021.
They still face opposition from conservatives. “We cannot support forcing Americans to fund earmarks that waste $1 million on an ‘environmental justice center’ or $4 million on a Green New Deal police station while 60% of Americans live paycheck-to-paycheck because of reckless government spending,” charged Ryan Walker, executive vice president at Heritage Action.
The overall bill, which now is in the Senate, pays for the Department of Veterans Affairs, highways, food stamps, the FBI, the EPA and others.
The Philadelphia Center was cited on X for an apparent advertisement for a “play party.”
A report at Them said the letter requested the removal of the funding, but after taking fire from liberals, Fetterman backtracked and said the letter was generated by staff members.
He said he would work to restore $1 million to the “fetish” center soon.
“The senators’ about-face came mere hours after Chaya Raichik, founder of the anti-LGBTQ+ advocacy group ‘Libs of TikTok,’ posted about the William Way Center on social media. Raichik alleged that the center ‘boasts rooms to try BDSM and s*x f*tishes,’ referring to the center’s partnership with ‘The Aviary,’ a local kink group that has hosted semi-monthly events in the center for nearly a decade.”
Casey’s office stood by the change, insisting that the “highest level of scrutiny” must apply to projects that use tax money.
Fetterman said even though he supported it, the funding likely had to be removed for the bill to survive.
“The choice was either to pull it or watch it get stripped out, attacked by Republicans, and ultimately killed,” he explained.
The Philly Voice reported that center officials denied anything was wrong with activities at their location.
But the report noted there was an additional complication:
“Meanwhile, over the weekend, Darius McLean, the chief operating officer of the William Way Center, and his wife, Celena Morrison, the executive director of the city’s Office of LGBT Affairs, were arrested after a traffic stop. The state trooper involved has been placed on restricted duty while the incident is investigated. Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker called the incident ‘very concerning.”
Commentator Jesse Watters took up the subject in a video, pointing out Congress’ plans to spend $850,000 for “bus stop equity” in California, $1 million for a solar paneled jail in the South Pacific, $100,000 for an “internet café” in Oregon and $15 million to strap ankle monitors on cows.
Why? He wondered. “They are 1,000 pounds, and slow, and they are fenced in.”
He even noted that the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., had one, for $5 million for a shooting range.

5531,fake,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-05-05,"05/05/2024 / By Ethan Huff
To limit global temperature increases – or so they say – the Group of Seven (G7) nations have announced plans to sign a deal that will force all remaining coal-fired power plants in member state territories to close down between 2030 and 2035.
With few exceptions, the nations of the G7 – or at least those over which the G7 has influence and control – will be expected to come up with energy production alternatives that the globalists have decided are good for the climate and the planet.
All of this was devised at the United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai last December where globalist powerbrokers decided that Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States must “fully decarbonize electricity by 2035” in order to stop global temperatures from rising another 1.5 degrees Celsius.
Since Germany and Japan derive more than one-quarter of their total electricity from coal, these two nations will reportedly be granted some leeway with the coal shutdown plan, Reuters reported. Germany, though, is still planning to phase out coal, just by 2038 at the latest, while Japan has not yet set a date.
(Related: Germany recently closed the last three of its nuclear power facilities, creating an energy deficit that is forcing the European powerhouse to buy nuclear-generated electricity from France.)
According to the climate lobby, coal is the most heavily polluting earth-based “fossil” fuel in existence. Its burning does admittedly spread lead and other chemical toxins wherever the soot lands.

Ministers from the U.S., Great Britain, France, Germany, Canada and Japan are reportedly planning to rubber stamp a technical agreement that will outlaw the burning of coal for energy starting now with a roughly seven-year plan for the phase-out to fully mature.
“We do have an agreement to phase out coal in the first half of the 2030s,” said UK minister for nuclear and renewables Andrew Bowie in a recent interview with CNBC.
Statements made at the G7 meeting suggest that a final agreement is soon on the way that even with some leeway provisions will remain “consistent with keeping a limit of 1.5C temperature rise [above pre-industrial levels] within reach, in line with countries’ net zero pathways.”
G7 chair Gilberto Pichetto Fratin, Italy’s energy minister, also said that the ministers are discussing plans to restrict the import of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) into Europe, likely in retaliation against Vladimir Putin for invading Ukraine with his special military operation.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has also announced plans to finalize a new set of rules establishing stricter emissions standards for power plants in general. If enacted, the rules will force all remaining long-term power plants to cut or capture at least 90 percent of their carbon “pollution.”
“These rules, finalized under separate authorities including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, will significantly reduce climate, air, water, and land pollution from the power sector, delivering on the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to protect public health, advance environmental justice, and confront the climate crisis,” the EPA said in a press release.
According to investigative journalist John Solomon, the EPA’s plans will massively drive-up energy costs for consumers while further destabilizing the already shaky U.S. power grid.
“What about China and India?” one commenter asked about the two most-polluting nations on earth, which are not included in the coal phase-out at all. “These countries are the world’s worst polluters by any standard – why do they get a free pass?”

2453,real,INSTITUTIONAL_AND_MEDIA_DISTRUST_PUBLIC_INSTITUTIONS,2024-05-16,"AI and deepfakes blur reality in India elections
In November last year, Muralikrishnan Chinnadurai was watching a livestream of a Tamil-language event in the UK when he noticed something odd.
A woman introduced as Duwaraka, daughter of Velupillai Prabhakaran, the Tamil Tiger militant chief, was giving a speech.
The problem was that Duwaraka had died more than a decade earlier, in an airstrike in 2009 during the closing days of the Sri Lankan civil war. The then-23-year-old's body was never found.
And now, here she was - seemingly a middle-aged woman - exhorting Tamilians across the world to take forward the political struggle for their freedom.
Mr Chinnadurai, a fact-checker in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, watched the video closely, noticed glitches in the video and soon pinned it down to being a figure generated by artificial intelligence (AI).
The potential problems were immediately clear to Mr Chinnadurai: ""This is an emotive issue in the state [Tamil Nadu] and with elections around the corner, the misinformation could quickly spread.""
As India goes to the polls, it is impossible to avoid the wealth of AI-generated content being created - from campaign videos, to personalised audio messages in a range of Indian languages, and even automated calls made to voters in a candidate's voice.
Content creators like Shahid Sheikh have even had fun using AI tools to show Indian politicians in avatars we haven't seen them in before: wearing athleisure, playing music and dancing.
But as the tools get more sophisticated, experts worry about its implications when it comes to making fake news appear real.
""Rumours have always been a part of electioneering. [But] in the age of social media, it can spread like wildfire,"" says SY Qureshi, the country's former chief election commissioner.
""It can actually set the country on fire.""
India's political parties are not the first in the world to take advantage of recent developments in AI. Just over the border in Pakistan, it allowed jailed politician Imran Khan to address a rally.
And in India itself, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also already made the best of the emerging technology to campaign effectively - addressing an audience in Hindi which, by using the government-created AI tool Bhashini, was then translated into Tamil in real time.
But it can also be used to manipulate words and messages.
Last month, two viral videos showed Bollywood stars Ranveer Singh and Aamir Khan campaigning for the opposition Congress party. Both filed police complaints saying these were deepfakes, made without their consent.
Then, on 29 April, Prime Minister Modi raised concerns about AI being used to distort speeches by senior leaders of the ruling party, including him.
The next day, police arrested two people, one each from the opposition Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress party, in connection with a doctored video of Home Minister Amit Shah.
Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has also faced similar accusations from opposition leaders in the country.
The problem is - despite the arrests - there is no comprehensive regulation in place, according to experts.
Which means ""if you're caught doing something wrong, then there might be a slap on your wrist at best"", according to Srinivas Kodali, a data and security researcher.
In the absence of regulation, creators told the BBC they have to rely on personal ethics to decide the kind of work they choose to do or not do.
The BBC learned that, among the requests from politicians, were pornographic imagery and morphing of videos and audios of their rivals to damage their reputation.
""I was once asked to make an original look like a deepfake because the original video, if shared widely, would make the politician look bad,"" reveals Divyendra Singh Jadoun.
""So his team wanted me to create a deepfake that they could pass off as the original.""
Mr Jadoun, founder of The Indian Deepfaker (TID), which created tools to help people use open source AI software to create campaign material for Indian politicians, insists on putting disclaimers on anything he makes so it is clear it is not real.
But it is still hard to control.
Mr Sheikh, who works with a marketing agency in the eastern state of West Bengal, has seen his work shared without permission or credit by politicians or political pages on social media.
""One politician used an image I created of Mr Modi without context and without mentioning it was created using AI,"" he says.
And it is now so easy to create a deepfake that anyone can do it.
""What used to take us seven or eight days to create can now be done in three minutes,"" Mr Jadoun explains. ""You just need to have a computer.""
Indeed, the BBC got a first-hand look at just how easy it is to create a fake phone call between two people - in this case, me and former US president Donald Trump.
Despite the risks, India had initially said it wasn't considering a law for AI. This March, however, it sprung into action after a furore over Google's Gemini chatbot response to a query asking: ""Is Modi a fascist?""
Rajeev Chandrasekhar, the country's junior information technology minister, said it had violated the country's IT laws.
Since then, the Indian government has asked tech companies to get its explicit permission before publicly launching ""unreliable"" or ""under-tested"" generative AI models or tools. It has also warned against responses by these tools that ""threaten the integrity of the electoral process"".
But it isn't enough: fact-checkers say keeping up with debunking such content is an uphill task, particularly during the elections when misinformation hits a peak.
""Information travels at the speed of 100km per hour,"" says Mr Chinnadurai, who runs a media watchdog in Tamil Nadu. ""The debunked information we disseminate will go at 20km per hour.""
And these fakes are even making their way into the mainstream media, says Mr Kodali. Despite this, the ""election commission is publicly silent on AI"".
""There are no rules at large,"" Mr Kodali says. ""They're letting the tech industry self-regulate instead of coming up with actual regulations.""
There isn't a foolproof solution in sight, experts say.
""But [for now] if action is taken against people forwarding fakes, it might scare others against sharing unverified information,"" says Mr Qureshi.

Bulgaria last Wednesday passed changes to its education law, widening its scope to ban LGBTQ ""propaganda"" in schools in what rights groups have slammed as ""discriminatory"".
The law now bans the ""propaganda, promotion or incitement in any way, directly or indirectly, in the education system of ideas and views related to non-traditional sexual orientation and/or gender identity other than the biological one"".
Human Rights Commissioner Michael O'Flaherty wrote on X that he was ""deeply concerned by the recent law passed by Bulgaria's Parliament to ban so-called LGBTI 'propaganda' in schools"".
""I call on President Radev not to sign it,"" he said.
""Authorities should tackle discrimination and hostile rhetoric against LGBTI people, including in the run-up to elections.""
The amendment, which was proposed by the European Union country's pro-Russian Vazrazhdane party, sparked protests in the capital with demonstrators chanting ""Shame on you"".
Most of the MPs from Boyko Borissov’s GERB party (EPP-affiliated) as well as all MPs from the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and from Slavi Trifonov’s “There is Such a People” supported Vazrazhdane’s bill. The ALDE-affiliated Movement for Rights and Freedoms was split over the vote.
Homophobic ideas often feature in Bulgaria's political debate and in the media, as the former communist republic faces its seventh parliamentary elections in three and a half years amid serious political instability.
Lawmakers blamed a need to act quickly on what they deemed as the ""unacceptable normalisation of a non-traditional sexual orientation"" in recent ""propaganda"".
The parliament took advantage of the climate of ""culture war"" around the Paris Olympics to pass the reform, said lawyer Denitsa Lyubenova from Deystvie LGBTQ rights group.

NEW DELHI (AP) — Bollywood stars seldom weigh in on politics, so videos showing two celebrities criticizing Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi — and endorsing his main opposition, the Congress party — were bound to go viral.
But the clips of A-list actors Aamir Khan and Ranveer Singh were fake, AI-generated videos that were yet another example of the false or misleading claims swirling online with the goal of influencing India’s election. Both actors filed complaints with police but such actions do little to stanch the flow of such misinformation.
Experts warn AI deepfakes will aim to mislead voters and undermine elections around the world
Here’s how governments and organizations are responding to the threat.
- In the U.S., the FCC outlawed robocalls containing AI-generated voices, which have been used to discourage voters.
- Major tech companies have signed an accord to prevent AI from being used to disrupt democratic elections worldwide.
- And a Davos report found AI-powered misinformation is the world’s biggest short-term threat.
AI-powered misinformation and disinformation are emerging risks as people in a slew of countries head to the polls. Read more on the 25 elections in 2024 that could change the world, and take a look at more of the AP’s global elections coverage.
Claims circulating online in India recently have misstated details about casting a ballot, claimed without evidence that the election will be rigged, and called for violence against India’s Muslims.
Researchers who track misinformation and hate speech in India say tech companies’ poor enforcement of their own policies has created perfect conditions for harmful content that could distort public opinion, spur violence and leave millions of voters wondering what to believe.
“A non-discerning user or regular user has no idea whether it’s someone, an individual sharing his or her thoughts on the other end, or is it a bot?” Rekha Singh, a 49-year-old voter, told The Associated Press. Singh said she worries that social media algorithms distort voters’ view of reality. “So you are biased without even realizing it,” she said.
In a year crowded with big elections, the sprawling vote in India stands out. The world’s most populous country boasts dozens of languages, the greatest number of WhatsApp users as well as the largest number of YouTube subscribers. Nearly 1 billion voters are eligible to cast a ballot in the election, which runs into June.
Tech companies like Google and Meta, the owner of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, say they are working to combat deceptive or hateful content while helping voters find reliable sources. But researchers who have long tracked disinformation in India say their promises ring hollow after years of failed enforcement and “cookie-cutter” approaches that fail to account for India’s linguistic, religious, geographic and cultural diversity.
Given India’s size and its importance for social media companies, you might expect more of a focus, say disinformation researchers who focus on India.
“The platforms are earning money off of this. They are benefiting from it, and the whole country is paying the price,” said Ritumbra Manuvie a law professor at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. Manuvie is a leader of The London Story, an Indian diaspora group which last month organized a protest outside Meta’s London offices.
Research by the group and another organization, India Civil Watch International, found that Meta allowed political advertisements and posts that contained anti-Muslim hate speech, Hindu nationalist narratives, misogynistic posts about female candidates as well as ads encouraging violence against political opponents.
The ads were seen more than 65 million times over 90 days earlier this year. Together they cost more than $1 million.
Meta defends its work on global elections and disputed the findings of the research on India, noting that it has expanded its work with independent fact-checking organizations ahead of the election, and has employees around the world ready to act in case its platforms are misused to spread misinformation. Nick Clegg, Meta’s president of global affairs, said of India’s election: “It’s a huge, huge test for us.”
“We have months and months and months of preparation in India,” he told The Associated Press during a recent interview. “We have teams working around the clock. We have fact checkers in multiple languages operating in India. We have a 24-hour escalation system.”
YouTube is another problematic site for disinformation in India, experts say. To test how well that video-sharing platform was doing in enforcing its own rules, researchers at the nonprofits Global Witness and Access Now created 48 fake ads in English, Hindi and Telugu with false voting information or calls for violence. One claimed India raised its voting age to 21, though it remains 18, while another said women could vote by text message, though they cannot. A third called for the use of force at polling places.
When Global Witness submitted the ads to YouTube for approval, the response was disappointing, said Henry Peck, an investigator at Global Witness.
“YouTube didn’t act on any of them,” Peck said, and instead approved the ads for publication.
Google, YouTube’s owner, criticized the research and noted that it has multiple procedures in place to catch ads that violate its rules. Global Witness removed the ads before they could be spotted and blocked, the company said.
“Our policies explicitly prohibit ads making demonstrably false claims that could undermine participation or trust in an election, which we enforce in several Indian languages,” Google said in a statement. The company also noted its partnerships with fact-checking groups.
AI is this year’s newest threat, as advances in programs make it easier than ever to create lifelike images, video or audio. AI deepfakes are popping up in elections across the world, from Moldova to Bangladesh.
Senthil Nayagam, founder of an AI startup called Muonium AI, believes there is growing demand for deepfakes, especially of politicians. In the run up to the election, he had several inquiries on making political videos using AI. “There’s a market for this, no doubt,” he said.
Some of the fakes Nayagam produces feature dead politicians and are not meant to be taken seriously, but other deepfakes circulating online could potentially fool voters. It’s a danger Modi himself has highlighted.
“We need to educate people about artificial intelligence and deepfakes, how it works, what it can do,” Modi said.
India’s Information and Technology Ministry has directed social media companies to remove disinformation, especially deepfakes. But experts say a lack of clear regulation or law focused on AI and deepfakes makes it harder to squash, leaving it to voters to determine what is true and what is fiction.
For first-time voter Ankita Jasra, 18, these uncertainties can make it hard to know what to believe.
“If I don’t know what is being said is true, I don’t think I can trust in the people that are governing my country,” she said.

5880,fake,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-07-12,"Since the start of the war, Ukraine has lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers with nobody to replace them. The Ukrainian army is now so depleted from these losses that the Volodymyr Zelensky regime is grasping to stuff anything with a pulse into uniform so the human sacrifices can continue.
Prisoners are reportedly ""volunteering"" to fight for Zelensky in exchange for their release. Since May, some 2,800 Ukrainian prisoners have been sent to the front lines with as many as 20,000 more soon to join them, according to Ukrainian Justice Minister Denis Malyuska.
""You can put an end to this and start a new life,"" is what one recruiter is telling convicts in an effort to lure them onto the battlefield for Zelensky.
A new law adopted by the Ukrainian parliament that same month allows the prison population the option to fight for Zelensky in exchange for early release. A contract is forged to force the deal, which covers convicted drug traffickers and perpetrators of certain violent crimes, including homicide.
(Related: Speaking of war, bombed-out Gaza is seeing a worsening hunger crisis as Israel starves out the embattled Palestinians.)
One of the prisons involved in the scheme is Prison No. 14 in Odessa, located in southern Ukraine. The Ukrainian army has really been targeting Prison No. 14 for new recruits with volunteers being promised training and a monthly salary of around 100,000 hryvnias, or just under €2,500 (around $2,700).

""This is about the same as the standard military salary in Ukraine,"" reported Remix News. ""Those who are deployed in assault brigades at the front earn the equivalent of €2,750 a month.""
Since the summer of 2022, Russia has been doing the very same thing by replenishing its ranks with prisoners. In 2023, thousands of convicts were seriously wounded or killed fighting for Vladimir Putin just in the eastern Ukrainian town of Bakhmut.
Nearby Germany is making bank from all this as Rheinmetall, the country's largest arms manufacturer, just scored a massive €8.5 billion order for artillery shells, most of which will be sent to Ukraine.
""The new order alone is more than the company's total 2023 sales of €7.17 billion,"" Remix News revealed. ""Rheinmetall is Germany's largest arms manufacturer, producing not only ammunition but also tanks, military trucks and weapons.""
Finland is also ""reaping dividends"" from the war by using it as a testing ground for new weaponry, according to a senior defense official.
The New York Times also reported that Russia is releasing female prison inmates to join the war in Ukraine, this after releasing tens of thousands of male convicts.
Russia, meanwhile, claims to have taken control of two villages in eastern Ukraine: the settlement of Stepova Novoselivka in the Kharkiv region and Novopokrovske in the Donetsk region.
For the first time, Hungarian President Viktor Orbán will visit Zelensky. Orbán is one of the most pro-Russian leaders in Europe, having vetoed a scheme to siphon $1.4 billion from frozen Russian assets to procure and supply fresh arms and other aid to Ukraine.
""They were making fun of Russia two years ago for doing this,"" one commenter wrote about Ukraine's hypocritical decision to start creating new troops out of imprisoned criminals.

5722,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-08-22,"Deaths from extreme heat are projected to rise sharply in the coming years, far outpacing an expected slowdown in cold-related deaths.
Extreme heat and cold cause approximately 407,500 deaths in Europe every year, and if nothing further is done to combat climate change, an additional 55,000 people will die annually by the year 2100 – a 13.5 per cent increase, according to new estimates from European Commission researchers.
Currently, the vast majority of Europe’s temperature-related deaths are tied to cold weather, but extreme heat will become an increasingly lethal challenge, particularly in southern Europe and areas with more elderly people, according to the study, which was published in The Lancet Public Health journal.
The analysis assumed a 3°C increase in global warming, which is at the upper end of the current trajectory, according to the latest United Nations estimates. It’s also double the 1.5°C goal set by the Paris Agreement.
""Europe, like the rest of the world, is facing a growing number of extremely hot days, and countries are not prepared for the impacts this will have on the health of their populations,"" Madeleine Thomson, head of climate impacts and adaptation at the UK-based health foundation the Wellcome Trust, which was not involved in the study, said in an email.
The researchers analysed data for nearly 1,400 regions in 30 countries across Europe to estimate the number of deaths from extreme heat and cold weather over time, and took population ageing into account to predict how these levels could change by 2100.
That approach allowed them to identify ""hotspots where people will be worst affected in the future,"" Juan-Carlos Ciscar, one of the study authors and a scientific officer at the Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC), said in a statement.
More cold deaths in northern regions
Between 1991 and 2020, there were about 364,000 cold-related deaths and 44,000 heat-related deaths per year across Europe, with cold killing more people in eastern Europe and extreme heat causing more fatalities in southern Europe, the study found.
These regional disparities are only expected to grow, according to the researchers.
While the overall number of cold-related deaths should decline somewhat in the coming decades, they are expected to increase in Ireland, Norway, and Sweden, where the number of people aged 85 and up is growing.
Heat-related deaths are also slated to rise sharply across the continent, with Spain, Italy, Greece, and parts of France to be most affected.
""With climate change, heatwaves are becoming more frequent, more intense, and lasting longer,"" Rebecca Emerton, a climate scientist at the EU-funded Copernicus Climate Change Service who was not involved with the study, told Euronews Health.
Notably, the new analysis is based on people living in cities, where heat may pose a greater health risk than in rural areas, and doesn’t take demographics like gender or ethnicity into account.
Even so, the findings indicate ""there is a critical need for the development of more targeted policies to protect these areas and members of society most at risk from temperature extremes,"" David García-León, a study author and JRC scientific officer, said in a statement.
UN calls for international climate action
Last month, UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for international cooperation to address extreme heat, with a focus on vulnerable groups, worker protection, and investment in renewable energy over fossil fuels in order to limit warming to 1.5°C.
The new study also follows a separate analysis that found that policy interventions to adapt to climate change over the past two decades have saved thousands of lives, but that more should be done to curb preventable deaths.
Those researchers, from the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, highlighted the role of early warning systems and heat prevention plans implemented after more than 70,000 people died as a result of scorching temperatures in 2003.
Extreme heat poses a health risk beyond death. It has also been tied to a higher risk of miscarriage for women working in extreme heat and can exacerbate mental illness.
People will also have to contend with the ""indirect impacts"" of wildfires, agricultural failure and other environmental and infrastructure problems, Thomson, from the Wellcome Trust, said.
These issues ""will have knock-on effects on our lives,"" she said."
6005,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-01-25,"Last year's extreme weather underscored the importance of the world’s largest land-based carbon sink.
Human-induced global warming, and not El Niño, was the primary driver of last year's severe drought in the Amazon, researchers said on Wednesday.
The drought sent rivers to record lows, required deliveries of food and drinking water to hundreds of river communities and killed dozens of endangered dolphins.
Both climate change and El Niño contributed about equally to a reduction in rainfall. But higher global temperatures were the biggest reason for the drought, according to World Weather Attribution, an initiative that brings together climate scientists to rapidly analyse extreme events and their possible connections to climate change.
The drought was agricultural, combining reduced rainfall with hotter conditions that evaporated moisture from plants and soil. It was that heat-driven evaporation that was critical in the drought’s severity, said study co-author Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at the Imperial College of London.
“What is now about a one-in-50-year event would have been much less likely to occur in a 1.2-degree cooler world. If we continue to warm the climate, this combination of low rainfall and high temperatures will become even more frequent,” Otto said at a news conference on Wednesday.
The team uses a scientifically accepted method of running computer simulations of weather events as they would have unfolded in a fictional world without global warming, and comparing those results with what really happened.
Amazon drought brought wildfires and crop failures in 2023
The drought in the Amazon - the world's largest rainforest and crucial in storing away carbon dioxide that would otherwise contribute to warming - came as Earth endured the hottest year on record. The planet is closer than ever to the 1.5 degrees Celsius increase since pre-industrial times that nations had hoped to stay within to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, such as deadly heat, rising seas, flooding and wildfires.
In Brazil's Tefé Lake, water temperatures soared to 39.1 degrees Celsius, likely causing the deaths of more than 150 pink and tucuxi river dolphins, two endangered species.
Along the Amazon River, people saw their crops wither and fish disappear, and with travel impossible due to low rivers, formed long lines on riverbanks to receive relief supplies. In Manaus, the region's largest city, the more than 2 million residents choked for months on wildfire smoke.
Why is the Amazon important in the fight against climate change?
Study co-author Regina Rodrigues, from Federal University of Santa Catarina, said the drought underscored the Amazon's importance in the fight against climate change.
“If we protect the forest, it will continue to act as the world’s largest land-based carbon sink,” Rodrigues said in a statement. “But if we allow human-induced emissions and deforestation to push it through the tipping point, it will release large amounts of carbon dioxide, further complicating our fight against climate change.”
Luiz Candido, a meteorologist with Brazil's National Institute for Amazon Research, which didn’t participate in the study, said the findings support the scientific consensus that climate variations in the region have escalated to extreme conditions.
But Candido also argued that interactions among the oceans, the atmosphere, and the forest are complex and it's not possible yet to separate the impacts of natural climate variability from those of human-induced global warming. He also questioned whether the study overestimated plant evaporation, noting that many Amazon plants are much deeper-rooted than crops and were able to retain much of their moisture by reaching damp, deeper layers."

Units of the Russian Armed Forces are in the Kursk city of Sudzha, which the enemy does not control but there are daily clashes, commander of the Akhmat special forces Apti Alaudinov told Russian media.
""Today there are units of the Russian Defense Ministry in Sudzha. There is an enemy around and in some parts of the city. There are active clashes there every day. The enemy cannot say that he completely controls Sudzha, because he does not really control it,"" Alaudinov said.
The major general also said that Kiev is planning on seizing the Kursk nuclear power plant on August 11 and use this to start negotiations with Moscow with an ultimatum.

SOMA, Gambia (AP) — When Metta, a mother of six from rural Gambia, heard that lawmakers were considering reversing the country’s ban on female genital cutting, a centuries-old practice she underwent as a child and now fiercely opposes, she was determined that her voice be heard.
She packed her bag and boarded a bus to Gambia’s capital, Banjul, to join scores of women protesting outside the parliament in the largely Muslim nation of less than 3 million people in West Africa.
“I was standing there with a banner,” she told The Associated Press. “Once we got the news that the ban was kept in place, we danced and cried.”
Gambia was for months rocked by a heated debate on female genital mutilation, or FGM, a cultural rite rooted in concepts about sexual purity and control of women. It was the first time the practice — also known as female circumcision and outlawed in many nations — was publicly discussed. Reversing it would have been a global first.
Eventually, lawmakers killed the proposal by rejecting all its clauses and preventing a final vote on the bill on July 16. Rights groups declared victory but the debate stirred deep angst among women’s activists.
And though the world’s attention was focused on the legislative process, the real battle is still going on — quietly fought by people like Metta, far from the parliament’s chambers and across rural areas where activists say FGM is still prevalent and remains a highly sensitive topic.
For women, pain and confusion
Women in Gambia’s rural hinterland — even those like Metta who cheered in front of the parliament — are reluctant to talk about cutting, fearing a backlash. Some who spoke out against the practice said they received hate messages. When speaking to the AP, women would not give their full names for fear of reprisals.
Local activists are walking a thin line. After agreeing to give the AP full access to an awareness village meeting, they took it back, saying that the foreign journalists’ presence could jeopardize their efforts.
The challenges are staggering. The United Nations estimates that about 75% of women in Gambia have been subjected as young girls to FGM, which includes partial or full removal of a girl’s external genitalia. The World Health Organization says it’s a form of torture.
The procedure, typically performed by older women or traditional community practitioners, is often done with tools such as razor blades and can cause serious bleeding, death and complications later in life, including in childbirth.
More than 200 million women and girls across the world are survivors of FGM, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa, according to U.N. estimates. In the past eight years alone, some 30 million women globally have been cut, most of them in Africa but also in Asia and the Middle East, UNICEF said in March.
In 2015, Gambia’s former leader Yahya Jammeh — now in exile and accused of human rights violations — unexpectedly banned cutting, giving no explanations.
However, the practice continued. The first prosecutions occurred only last year, when three women were convicted for taking their daughters to be cut, sparking a backlash to the ban and setting off the debate.
Gambian authorities did not respond to a request for comment about the issue.
A debate that shook and divided Gambia
Supporters of the ban argued that cutting is rooted in Gambia’s culture and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad. Religious conservatives behind the campaign to reverse the ban described cutting as “one of the virtues of Islam.”
Those against FGM said its supporters are seeking to curtail women’s rights in the name of tradition.
Habibou Tamba, a 37-year-old local activist who attended the rally outside the parliament, said a prominent community member — whom he did not identify — sent him a message afterward, accusing him of serving the interests of the West.
“We will never be subjected to the Western ideology,” said the message, seen by the AP. It added: “This is the beginning of the war.”
But Tamba says that for him, protests were about the right of women to live free from pain, not about Western values.
At the awareness meeting, held at a local government office, activists talked to a few dozen women from neighboring villages about the perils of child marriage and FGM. On the wall, they projected images of deformed female genitalia to explain possible health complications from cutting.
With each picture, women in the room gasped with shock and disgust. But not all were convinced.
“I went through FGM but nothing happened to me,” said one woman. “I have more than five children and I never had any complications.”
“It’s our culture and it’s also a part of the teaching of the prophet,” she said, and added that after the ban was introduced, she took her daughter far from their village to be cut in secrecy.
Another woman said the ban was “violating our rights as Muslim women.” Not a single woman at the meeting spoke up in defense of the ban.
Rabietou, a 42-year-old mother of six, was outside nursing her youngest daughter, 7-month-old Fatima.
“I came here because of her,” she said, cradling her baby.
Rabietou’s eldest daughter, Aminata, 26, also came. The two had rallied women from their village to come to the meeting. Rabietou recounted how she was cut by a relative when she was a girl, and forced to leave school and get married at the age of 15.
A year later, she gave birth — in excruciating pain — to Aminata, who was also cut and left school early to marry.
“No one told me about the health consequences,” Rabietou said.
As she grew more aware of the risks through conversations with activists and other women, she became determined to break the cycle. She said she won’t have Fatima cut, and has also advised Aminata not to cut her daughter.
‘They took me to the bush and cut me’
Metta said she was cut when she was 8.
“No one said anything to me, just that it’s tradition,” she said.
She never discussed what happened with anyone. When activists started organizing meetings in her community, it was hard for her to believe what they were saying. But she came to the conclusion it’s time to start talking.
Women from her village started to share their experiences and soon discovered they all faced similar struggles: Pain when they were cut. A lot of pain when they were intimate with their husbands. Even more pain when they were giving birth.
In the end, after discussing it with their husbands, most decided to stop the cutting. None of Metta’s four daughters have been cut.
“Before, people used to say: If you don’t cut your daughter, she will not listen. She will not have discipline,” Metta said. “But going to the bush and teaching your children discipline are two very different things.”
“I will not let my daughters go through the same pain as I did,” she said.

5610,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-10-11,"As EU officials host a two-day summit on carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the south of France, environmental groups are questioning the underlying assumption that the technology is a viable way to keep billions of tonnes of planet-heating CO2 out of the atmosphere.
As EU officials gathered in Pau, France on Thursday (10 October) to discuss the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS), environmental groups have pointed to a huge drain on public money and a track record of project failure, while the European Commission is in talks with governments who have missed a legal deadline related to a CO2 storage target.
“Relying on CCS as a climate solution will force European governments to introduce eye-wateringly high subsidies to prop up a technology that has a history of failure,” said Andrew Reid, an energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), a sustainable energy think tank.
Reid is the author of a report released today that examines almost 200 projects on the drawing board across Europe today. He found CCS costs to be prohibitively high and concluded that upcoming projects currently on the drawing board in Europe could cost as much as €520 billion and require €140 billion of government support.
The report notes that the EU plans to ramp up the annual CO2 storage capacity to 50 million tonnes by 2030, 280MT a decade later, and 450MT by mid-century.
“As the small number of operational projects show, CCS is not likely to work as hoped and will take longer to implement than expected,” Reid said.
His report came just two days after the campaign group Oil Change International put out its own briefing which identified €3.3bn in subsidies already sunk into CCS projects in the EU, with up to €16bn more made available since 2020 as carbon capture has climbed back up the EU policy agenda.
“Despite 50 years of failure and over €3bn in subsidies from EU taxpayers, the fossil fuel industry still pushes carbon capture to boost its corporate profits, delay climate action, and distract from real solutions that would end the fossil fuel era,” said Myriam Douo, a campaigner with the US-based non-profit.
‘No alternative’
But EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson, opening the European Commission’s fourth Industrial Carbon Management Forum in Pau, southwest France, made it clear the EU executive now sees CCS as an integral part of its plan to meet the 2050 net-zero emissions goal, and the interim target it is set to propose early next year.
“Storage will play a major role in our journey to [net-zero by] 2050,” the EU’s top energy official said. “The 2040 climate target plan underlines that industrial carbon management is not just an alternative – it is a vital complement to renewable energy and energy efficiency.”
Citing the newly operational Northern Lights undersea storage project in Norway, and Denmark’s awarding in June of Europe’s first licences to explore onshore sites for potential CO2 storage, Simson spoke of “tangible on the ground progress” but warned that high capital costs remained a barrier to deployment.
“We must implement targeted derisking measures and provide the necessary financial support,” Simson said. “This will help reach final investment decisions on these projects.”
CCS Europe, a trade association lobbying in Brussels on behalf of pipeline and technology providers and carbon intensive sectors like cement and incineration plants, has previously rejected criticism from both the IEEFA and Oil Change International, with director Chris Davies accusing them of a “lack of objectivity and perspective”.
“It claims that carbon capture projects consistently fail, but in Europe, Norway’s Sleipner and Snohvit projects continue to capture and store some 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 annually after nearly 30 years in use,” he said of projects where carbon dioxide removed during natural gas extraction is pumped back underground.
Davies told Euronews he hoped to see swift action from the next Commission such as the proposaL, within 100 days of taking office, of a requirement for governments to submit “national industrial carbon management strategies with timescales for delivery and details of financial support mechanisms that will be introduced”.
Missed deadline
In a bid to overcome the thorny question of who should pay to get the scale-up rolling, the EU recently adopted legislation that forces oil and gas companies – among the most enthusiastic cheerleaders for CCS over the years – to put in place at their own expense storage facilities capable of locking away 50 million tonnes of CO2 a year from 2030.
For comparison, the Northern Lights project, in development since at least 2017 and opened with great fanfare last month, is expected to support injection of just 1.5MT a year – and backers Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies only made a final investment decision after the Norwegian state put up the bulk of the cost.
Chairing a debate at the Pau conference, Davies voiced his frustration at the slow pace of development, and had representatives from Germany, Greece and Romania – all of whom are banking on CCS to help meet emissions reduction targets – admit that no final investment decisions had been taken so far in their countries.
Under the Net Zero Industry Act signed into law in May, petroleum firms will have to deploy permanent CO2 storage capacity in proportion to their share of EU oil and gas production between 2020 and 2022. Governments were required to provide the Commission with the relavent data by 30 September.
But only 18 member states have so far provided any data to the Commission, which is now focused on persuading the remaining nine governments – including the Netherlands – to comply with the law before it can divide the 50MT target among petroleum majors like ENI, Shell and TotalEnergies who are active in Europe."
6076,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-11-08,"Every autumn, the UN holds its international climate summit or “Cop” (Conference of the Parties). Between each Cop, a smaller, lower-profile gathering takes place. Called the SB – short for “subsidary bodies” of the UN’s Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) – these smaller meetings matter but don’t draw as much public attention.
The SB meetings are a world apart from Cops. Held in the same small venue in the German city of Bonn every year, the latest, SB60, had 8,606 participants whereas last year’s Cop28 in Dubai had around 100,000. Observers make up about half of the SB participants, and the atmosphere is less about being there to show you care and more focused on the matter at hand – global negotiations.
In contrast to Cops, there are no pavilions and exhibition spaces. The focus is on negotiations and side events. In June 2024, our team of climate law and policy experts from the Cabot Institute at the University of Bristol attended SB60 as observers. We prioritised going to Bonn instead of the upcoming Cop29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, because SBs offer a chance to see negotiations in flux.
In Bonn, there’s more chance to speak directly to negotiators including diplomats, heads of state, and UNFCCC staff (who are less pressed for time) – and to have an influence on policy outcomes (because positions are not yet as cemented as they are at Cops).
SB60 revealed some important sticking points and challenges for delegates going to Cop29 in Baku, which starts on November 11. The negotiations proved to be particularly difficult in three key areas.
1. A stalled transition
The first is “just transition” – the idea of making society fairer for everyone as we respond to climate change. Negotiations collapsed before the end of SB60 due to disagreements on scope, timelines and implementation planning.
The term just transition was only defined and planned for at a global governance level for the first time at last year’s Cop28. There was a real push and pull between developing and developed countries when it came to setting out the aims and scope of this plan.
Developed countries, including Norway, the US and the EU, pushed to focus on jobs and technology. Developing countries, including the UN’s coalition of 77 developing countries known as the G-77, China, small island developing states, and 54 states of the UN’s Africa Group, wanted costs to be shared fairly in a way that recognises existing inequalities between countries, and with compensation for past harms.
There was a sense that developing countries wanted to see broader system changes within the UNFCCC. One of us (Alix Dietzel) noted down how the G-77 plus China stressed that getting just transition right was “key for the future of the Cops and the regime of the UNFCCC”.
Eventually, the developed countries’ version won out at Cop28. But at SB60, it became clear there were still deep disagreements over what a just transition means and how this will play out. Negotiations over how to achieve the targets for a just transition collapsed when states could not agree whether to include wider discussions of systemic inequality and new finance goals, and whether the UNFCCC’s five-yearly global stocktake required a scaling up of ambition.
The outcome document produced on the final day of SB60 stated that parties met and negotiated – but frustratingly, did not capture any views that can be used as a basis for further negotiations.
2. Responding to climate loss and damage
There is increasing urgency to deliver meaningful support to developing countries experiencing the worst economic and non-economic losses from climate impacts. These range from extreme weather and sea level rise to damage to ecosystems and communities. A key priority is funding to support the recovery and preparedness of the most at-risk countries and communities.

A new loss and damage fund, currently hosted by the World Bank, was established at Cop28. So far, it has received more than US$702 million (£540 million) in pledges. At SB60, the debate focused on how best to urgently scale up this funding and make it more easily available to the communities most in need of it.
Many countries and observers called for a more inclusive approach based on human rights, and stressed the need for technical support in less developed countries.
3. Finance is key
Cop29 is all about money. Billed as “the finance Cop”, leaders in Baku must agree on a new climate finance goal. Known as the “new collective quantified goal” (NCQG), this aims to support developing countries with climate action. Industrialised nations have only met the current annual target of US$100 billion once, in 2022. SB60 was meant to lay the groundwork for a finance deal at Cop29. The outcome in Bonn, however, was disappointing.
We observed that developing countries felt frustrated at the dithering of developed nations over who should pay and how much. The Colombian government, for example, is committed to decarbonisation, but in Bonn expressed dismay at the lack of concessionary climate finance to support this process.
Developing countries seemed angry that finance flows prioritise private infrastructure investment over key sectors that are considered non-profitable, such as education, health, coastal flooding defences or landslide prevention. This makes climate adaptation harder, especially in the context of high debt burdens.
The road to Baku
The intimate setting of the SB negotiation space might look like it could deliver better climate outcomes compared to huge Cops. Negotiators at Cop28 were crowded out by lobbyists and industry representatives. In Bonn this year, smaller numbers meant delegates could more easily meet for informal huddles outside the negotiation rooms.
At the Cop climate summits, observers like us normally don’t have a significant voice. But at SB60, interactive workshops and contact groups gave observers opportunities to speak. We held a side event with the global mayors network, C40 Cities, and Earthshot prize winners, the environmental and youth empowerment group Green Africa Youth Organization. Discussions focused on how to make urban climate policy more inclusive, and we later introduced ourselves to the UK negotiation team.
Contributions from civil society observers were recorded by the UNFCCC and incorporated into official SB reports on finance and loss and damage. Nevertheless, big decisions on just transition, loss and damage, and climate finance are constrained by competing geopolitical and economic interests, regardless of the size of the negotiating space.
SB60 set the scene for two weeks of fractious negotiations in Baku. Climate change-induced extreme weather events and changing weather patterns are accelerating. Key climate tipping points could be breached soon.
Developing countries will require trillions of dollars a year to adapt to and mitigate these extreme scenarios. Based on what we experienced in Bonn, a finance deal at Baku that delivers climate action for developing countries seems a long way off.

6221,real,GENDER_BASED_DISINFORMATION,2024-05-01,"US Vice President Kamala Harris was visiting Republican-led Florida to deliver a speech condemning Trump as the harsh ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy took effect.
Republican Trump has bragged about how justices he nominated allowed the conservative-leaning US Supreme Court to revoke the national right to abortion in 2022, in turn paving the way for 21 states to bring in total or partial bans.
""Today, an extreme abortion ban takes effect in Florida, banning reproductive health care before many women even know they are pregnant,"" Biden said in a statement.
""There is one person responsible for this nightmare: Donald Trump.""
Biden himself visited Florida last week as Democrats seek to make abortion one of the core issues of the 2024 election, seeing it as a vote-winner against Trump.
Florida's strict new law replaces a 15-week ban and has left women and clinics across the southern United States scrambling for options.
One of the most populous states in the country, Florida was one of the few in the region where the time limit for abortion was still relatively high, leading many women to travel there to terminate their pregnancies.
Harris, the first female, black and South Asian vice president in US history, has become the campaign's leading voice on abortion rights and will speak in the city of Jacksonville.
'Extremists'
In her speech, Harris was to describe the bans in Florida and 20 other states as ""Trump abortion bans,"" pinning the issue on the hard-right former president.
""This ban applies to many women before they even know they are pregnant -- which tells us the extremists who wrote this ban don't even know how a woman's body works. Or they just don't care,"" she was to say, according to excerpts released by her campaign.
Harris was also set to slam Trump's remarks in a Time magazine interview published on Tuesday in which he said states might monitor women's pregnancies to see if they have had abortions in defiance of a ban.
""Under Donald Trump, it would be fair game for women to be monitored and punished by the government,"" she was to say.
""Joe Biden and I have a different view: we believe no politician should ever come between a woman and a doctor.""
Despite touting the Supreme Court ruling, Trump has recently fudged on the abortion issue amid signs that it is hurting him in the polls. He repeatedly said in the Time interview that it was up to states to decide when asked if he would support a nationwide federal abortion ban.
By going to Florida the Democrats are taking the abortion fight right into Trump's backyard, as the scandal-tainted former commander-in-chief spends much of his time at his Mar-a-Lago resort in the south of the state.
Florida has meanwhile voted Republican since Trump's 2016 election victory, and its six-week abortion ban is the brainchild of Republican governor Ron DeSantis.
The conservative DeSantis, who unsuccessfully ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination this year, signed into law in April 2023 a bill to lower the limit from 15 weeks to six weeks.
The Sunshine State's supreme court dismissed a final legal challenge by pro-abortion groups in April, paving the way for the ban to take effect on Wednesday.
But Florida voters will have a chance to reverse the six-week limit in a referendum that will coincide with November's presidential election.

5199,fake,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-11-06,"11/06/2024 / By Lance D Johnson
The history behind the “AIDS” crisis is fraught with coverups, deceptive narratives and censorship.
The first cases of “AIDS” reported by the CDC were based on pneumocystis pneumonia infections of previously healthy gay men. This infection is caused by the normally harmless fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii, but the infection became severe in these individuals. Instead of asking why these infections were more severe in these individuals, medical authorities dismissed further inquiry into underlying factors. No attempt was made to investigate these cases through the perception of the terrain theory of disease, which addresses the whole individual and the conditions that breed disease. By only seeing disease through the perception of the germ theory, medical authorities played right into the hands of the pharmaceutical industry and snuffed out scientific progress on the matter.
By September of 1982, the medical establishment coined a new medical condition called AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). This umbrella term was used as a cover for many different types of infections, malnutrition, the negative effects of immunosuppressant drugs and other personal health decisions that damage the blood. The underlying causes exacerbating immunosuppression could easily be ignored for individuals who struggled with these different infections, because the umbrella term AIDS covered up the underlying causes of their health conditions.
By 1982, medical authorities claimed that AIDS had affected 335 people, killing 136 of them. Remarkably in 1983, scientists discovered human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). By 1984, HIV was attributed as the sole cause of AIDS, and many medical coverups began from here. Because the condition overwhelmingly affected men who practiced homosexuality, the disease was often referred to as gay-related immune deficiency, or GRID.
Since then, billions of dollars in research money has been awarded to scientists who uphold the HIV-AIDS connection. Today, medical authorities continue to postulate that HIV is the sole cause of AIDS, and discussion about the underlying factors of immunosuppression are disregarded as conspiracy theory. One of the first books to be censored was “The Health Scandal” written by Dr. Vernon Coleman in 1988.
“The Health Scandal” contained a chapter describing the truth about AIDS, which led to the book being censored.
Dr. Vernon Cole argues that AIDS should be viewed more as a blood-related disorder rather than a sexually transmitted disease that affects specific populations, like drug users and gay men. Cole asserts that the AIDS industry has grown into a vast bureaucracy, employing thousands and consuming enormous amounts of taxpayer money without delivering significant breakthroughs or saving lives.
Cole argues that the changing criteria for diagnosis have inflated the number of reported AIDS cases, which serves to justify ongoing funding and research efforts. From 2011 to 2021, there were approximately 400,000 AIDS patients diagnosed in the U.S. This is the result of expanding diagnostic criteria, which conceals the underlying causes of immunosuppression. This manipulation of statistics has led to allegations that many deaths attributed to AIDS are, in fact, from other blood and fungal infections, hospital-acquired infections or other common respiratory infections like tuberculosis or pneumonia.
Cole writes that AIDS may not exist as a unique disease but rather as a collection of previously identified conditions and immune system failures. By not getting to the bottom of these immune system failures, medical authorities have misled the public, putting people’s health at risk over several decades.
Cole suggests that the focus of medical and public health authorities should shift toward bolstering the immune system through lifestyle changes and nutritional support rather than adhering strictly to the helpless HIV/AIDS paradigm. This paradigm has followed a 50-year pattern of Big Pharma covering up symptoms, ignoring root causes and developing products that have a potential for high sales, while creating disease labels that require long term dependence on pharmaceutical drugs.

5527,fake,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-09-10,"09/10/2024 / By S.D. Wells
The Communist-Democrat politicians in Washington DC and their globalist cohorts are engaged in a multi-faceted agenda rooted in profound deceit. Using extreme censorship of anyone who questions their agenda, they’ve (literally) gotten away with murder using schemes, plots and propaganda to further their goals of obtaining complete control of the populace, by any means.
One way the “powers that be” have manipulated and weakened the population is by having the military spray health-decimating toxins from airplanes flying over cities and farms on a regular basis. Independent media, for decades, has been calling this out and gave it the name “chem-trails” to signify that chemicals are being doused upon the people and the land in an insidious attempt to pollute food, discard hazardous waste, and sicken folks so they need expensive medical care.
This has been deemed as a conspiracy theory and anyone who speaks about it, posts information online about it, or blows the whistle on it has been labeled a “conspiracy theorist.” Guess what?
Truth news was right and it’s real, because now, the communists and globalists are outright admitting to it all, claiming it all has a bigger purpose with a positive outcome. Their reason for spraying horrific chemicals, heavy metal toxins, and hospital waste over the skies of America? To battle “climate change.”
There exists a political ideology (a.k.a. New World Order) where malicious agents, sometimes called globalists, are attempting to create a world government, made up of only a few dozen billionaires, that decides the future and fate of all peoples, use of resources, utilization of all medicine and food, and so forth. One way to accomplish this is to keep the populace sick. This insidious agenda includes keeping toxic fluoride in the municipal tap water supply, injecting the masses with dirty vaccinations and gene therapy injections and spraying toxins, bacteria, and even viruses down from the skies.
This is very hard for most people to wrap their head around, that governments, especially the U.S. government, could be this evil and warped, but now they are admitting to it, to address a “greater good” concern, global warming. Supposedly, chemtrails are being used to block out the sun’s heat and save all humans from bursting into flames in the next decade or two. This will also keep all the glaciers from melting and the oceans from swallowing up all the continents, while further padding the pockets of the billionaire N.W.O. globalists. It’s all also part of the “Green New Deal” that Kommie Kamala wants to fully execute to destroy all farms, food and human health.
Why would the government admit to chemtrails now, after decades of calling it a conspiracy theory? It’s a gambit, which is a small sacrifice to gain a bigger advantage. In chess, a gambit is where a player sacrifices a pawn or piece of lesser value to capture a piece of great (or greater) value from their opponent. This requires careful thought.
So, what’s really in these chem-trails? Why are they so toxic to humanity, including humans, animals and agriculture? A woman who served 9 years in the U.S. Air Force has blown the whistle and told the world EXACTLY what most chemtrails contain, and it will blow your mind.
In an Instagram video that went viral, Kristen Meghan describes the contents of chemtrails, also termed “geoengineering” or “weather modification,” that the U.S. Air Force had her labeling as hazardous to even handle in small amounts, and now they’re being sprayed over our skies in massive portions.
Air Force veteran Kristen Meghan worked at a job entitled bio-environmental engineering where she was tasked with engineering these chemicals out of the workplace and substituting them with safer ones. They taught her how to pack, ship and dispose of these hazardous materials that they were spraying all over humanity. She says the chemicals being “injected” into our atmosphere include heavy metal toxins, barium, silver iodide, aluminum and much more. Got respiratory issues? Got dementia? No wonder why.

5914,fake,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-02-13,"EDITOR’S NOTE: This is absolutely insane and almost no one knows about it because no one is talking about it. Please share this far and wide! It is not a stretch to consider this is an offense at the level of treason against the United States and its citizens, but I’ll let you make that determination after you read.
I’m sure most of you reading this do not support the hundreds of billions of dollars we keep sending Ukraine, but I’m about to make it so much worse for you…
Very simply, it’s this: Did you know that the money we are sending Ukraine is structured as pure GIFTS?
If that doesn’t immediately blow you away, let me unpack that for you…
Of course they don’t use the word “gift” they use the word “grants” because it sounds better but they both mean the same thing — namely, that Ukraine never has to pay the money back.
Even the Left-Leaning ChatGPT admitted as much:
The financial aid the United States has been providing to Ukraine in recent years is a mix of both direct budgetary support and military assistance, rather than being structured as loans that need to be repaid. According to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the U.S. has provided billions in direct budgetary support to help Ukraine manage the acute budget deficit caused by the conflict, including funds to keep basic government services running and support for emergency responders. This assistance is designed to help the Government of Ukraine withstand economic, social, and political pressures and does not need to be repaid.
In addition to budgetary support, a significant portion of U.S. aid has been allocated to military and security assistance to help Ukraine defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. This includes funding for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which pays for training, weapons, and other military assistance, as well as funds to replenish U.S. weapons sent to Ukraine and for the Foreign Military Financing Program, enabling Ukraine to purchase new military equipment from the U.S.
Overall, the aid is part of the U.S.’s commitment to support Ukraine in the face of aggression, with the aim of ensuring the country’s stability and security. The funding for humanitarian and economic aid is provided with the understanding that it is a grant to support Ukraine’s immediate needs and long-term recovery, rather than a loan to be repaid.
I asked a second time just to confirm — Here was my follow-up question: “So none of the money given by the USA to Ukraine ever needs to be paid back?”
Answer:
The financial assistance provided by the United States to Ukraine, especially in the context of the recent aggression, has largely been structured as grants rather than loans. This means that these funds, including direct budgetary support and military aid, do not need to be paid back by Ukraine. The aid is intended to help the country address its immediate needs, support its government functions, and bolster its defense capabilities in the face of external aggression.
For instance, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has provided substantial direct budgetary support to Ukraine, aimed at alleviating the country’s budget deficit caused by the conflict and ensuring the continuity of essential government services. This kind of support is designed to be non-repayable and is given to help Ukraine withstand economic, social, and political pressures resulting from the conflict.
Moreover, the financial aid for military and security purposes, including funds allocated through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative and the Foreign Military Financing Program, is also provided as support that Ukraine is not required to repay. These funds are intended for Ukraine to purchase military equipment, receive training, and enhance its defense capabilities against aggression.
In summary, the financial aid from the U.S. to Ukraine in recent years, including both direct budgetary support and military assistance, is structured as grants that do not require repayment. This approach underscores the U.S. commitment to supporting Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and resilience in the face of challenges.
Are you kidding me?
If it’s still not knocking you off your chair, allow me to put it in a different context….
We’ve all heard about our National Debt, right?
How it’s out of control?
Here’s a picture for you from the US Debt Clock:
Yes, that would $34 TRILLION!
And here’s how fast it has been growing recently (and only accelerating):
- 2024: $34+ trillion
- 2023: $32 trillion
- 2022: $30.9 trillion
- 2021: $28.4 trillion
- 2020: $26.9 trillion
- 2019: $22.7 trillion
Why do we have that National Debt?
We all took high school government / civics class, right?
It was debt we borrowed as a nation to finance things like the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, the War of 1812, and so on!
When we needed to finance a war, we BORROWED the money, and we’re still paying it back hundreds of years later in 2024!
So our children are saddled with debt for centuries and it’s only growing and becoming more and more impossible to pay back, and what do we do?
Do we take HUNDREDS of BILLIONS of dollars and try to pay it down?
Nah.
It would be much wiser to just give that money away to Ukraine!!
Folks, this is treason — point blank, no other way to say it.
Even if you assume we want to help Ukraine (which I do not agree with that premise) but even so if that were the case, it should be structured like any other business transaction — a repayable loan! Just like we had to do!
Our politicians have violated their oaths of office and shown allegiance to other countries (Ukraine and Israel) far above any allegiance to the United States.
No one would ever in their right minds do this!
Unless….
Unless it was all one big money-laundering operation?
In that case it makes perfect sense:
FTX Money Laundering Scheme To Ukraine CONFIRMED?
FTX Money Laundering Scheme To Ukraine CONFIRMED?
Buckle up folks!
I have a MAJOR update on a story we first brought you back in the Fall of 2022.
""Fall"" is appropriate because that's when crypto firm FTX had its massive fall from grace.
And now just this week it looks like we may have confirmation that our reporting back in 2022 was 100% accurate.
Imagine that.
Let me back up for just a minute in case we have people who are new to this story or who need a refresher.
I'll publish our full reporting from 2022 down below but here's the quick recap...

Taxes out the ears!
Then the US Government takes your tax dollars and sends billions upon billions over to Ukraine...
Ukraine then invested a big chunk of that money in FTX (that's called money laundering)...
FTX donates huge amounts back to the Democrat party...
The Democrats then use that money to buy, influence and steal elections.
What a great system!
And if you think that's just crazy Noah coming up with a crazy conspiracy theory, it's not.
Here is Elon Musk exposing it too:

NOW does it make sense why billions of your tax dollars are going to Ukraine every month?
You didn't honestly think we were just giving it all away, did you?
Of course not!
It's a complex money laundering operation!
Ok, now here's the update.
Prepare to have your mind blown.
This is truly ""hidden in plain sight"".
So we start here with the understanding that after FTX collapsed it owed customers about $8.7 BILLION:
JUST IN: New report shows FTX owed its customers $8.7 BILLION after commingling and misusing their deposits.

Ok, you with me so far?
FTX is in the hole $8.7 BILLY.
But remember, FTX was a key player in the money laundering operation, so they have to be made whole.
Then this happens:

Ok, now stay with me because here's the final piece...
To recap:
FTX needs $8.7 Billion...
$6.2 Billion ""accidentally"" gets sent to the wrong place...
Now here it is:
FTX suddenly ""recovers"" $7 billion!
Wow, it's a miracle!

If you've been following this Sam Bankman-Fried / FTX scandal, you know this is big.
In fact, it's looking like Biden, Ukraine, Crypto and Pedos....are all possibly connected.
More on that at the end of this article -- jump down there first if you don't know anything about this story and need to get caught up to speed first.
We already knew Biden and many top Dems were ensnarled in this thing, and the crooked MSM is doing everything they can to give them cover.
But here's what's also been ignored: it's not just the Democrats.
I've been telling you for 7 years now, it's NEVER been about Republican vs. Democrat.
That's a fake dichotomy designed to keep you distracted.
R's and D's are mostly on the same team.
In fact, I estimate there are maybe 10-20 honest people left in the entire D.C. system.
One is Trump.
Another is Kari Lake.
And there are probably no more than 20 others -- if that many.
Everyone else, whether they've got an (R) or a (D) in front of their name is all crooked and sold out.
So sad to see what they've done to our country.
Let's get into the details...
According to Bloomberg, McConnell took $1 million:
From Bloomberg, here's more:
FTX US, a part of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire that catered to American customers, contributed to a super-PAC fighting for control of the Senate in the midterm election just days before the company’s collapse.
The Senate Leadership Fund, which is aligned with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and was the top spender in the 2022 midterms, received the $1 million donation on Oct. 27, according to its most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission. Only a couple of weeks later, more than a 100 FTX-related companies, including the US arm, filed for bankruptcy, and Bankman-Fried resigned as head of the corporate group.
The contributor listed on the FEC donation report is West Realm Shires Services Inc. and FTX US is its commercial name.
The Senate Leadership Fund did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The super-PAC spent $239 million in the midterms on behalf of Republican candidates, according to OpenSecrets, which tracks money in politics.
While several members of Congress, including Illinois Senator Richard Durbin, a Democrat, and Republican Representative Kevin Hern of Oklahoma have said they would return donations from FTX executives or give the money to charities, there isn’t a requirement in election law for committees to return donations to companies that go bankrupt.
FTX US also gave $750,000 to the Congressional Leadership Fund and $150,000 to the American Patriots PAC, both of which supported House Republican candidates. It gave $100,000 to the Alabama Conservatives Fund, which backed Republican Katie Britt’s successful run for the state’s open Senate seat.
Individual executives at the broader FTX company have given far more money. Bankman-Fried emerged as major donor to Democratic candidates leading up to the Nov. 8 midterm elections, donating most of the $39.4 million that he gave to them, FEC records show. One of his top lieutenants, Ryan Salame, gave $23.6 million -- mostly to Republicans.
We always knew Mitch was a snake, didn't we?
A rich snake.
According to a popular report circulating Twitter, here is the FULL LIST:

We have not been able to independently verify every name on this list, and to be fair we also note that candidates are rarely aware of every person or entity that makes a donation to their campaign -- but that said, you might want to write down these names and remember them.
Kari Lake says the corruption is SO DEEP and SO WICKED it will blow your mind:

Here is just a portion of the article Kari Lake posted...from Revolver read the full story here:
Just days ago, Bloomberg estimated 30-year-old Sam Bankman-Fried’s (SBF) personal wealth at an astonishing $16 billion. Now, the disgraced FTX founder is essentially bankrupt, and if there is a shred of justice in the world, soon headed for prison.
The collapse of FTX and its founder is one of the most spectacular implosions in history. There is no shortage of narratives to mine for interesting article fodder. Celebrities like Tom Brady and his now ex-wife Gisele lost millions to the scam. There’s the Silicon Valley “smart money” that was hopelessly entranced by a wunderkind founder. SBF also used his ill-begotten lucre to become one of the largest donors in left-wing politics of the past four years. There’s also the FTX pet philosophy of “effective altruism,” the cult-like fad ideology of contemporary Silicon Valley that SBF exploited to conduct his fraud and justify taking enormous risks. And who can forget the 28-year-old girlboss CEO of Alameda Research Caroline Ellison, who bragged that her vast financial empire only requires “elementary school math” to turn profits, and whose public list of turn-ons includes “controlling major world governments.”
Last but not least, there’s the group sex (don’t worry, everyone involved in this “polycule” situation is hideous).
All of these storylines are being regurgitated ad nauseum by countless other media outlets. The story that Revolver is about to tell you is even bigger and more spectacular than all the other fascinating storylines listed above. In fact, dear reader, FTX may not even be the biggest scam in crypto. Another, even more spectacular scam may still be live, ready to collapse at any moment… if anyone decides to take a real look at it.
The story you’re about to hear concerns the third-largest crypto-currency on the planet, which you’ve probably never heard of. It is a story of how a former Disney child-actor — a Jeffrey Epstein associate who was embroiled in an under-age sex scandal — bizarrely emerged as one of the world’s strangest crypto-currency moguls. It is the story that raises serious questions as to whether an entire cryptocurrency is a scam — effectively a private money-printer. And to top it all off, there is reason to believe that if this cryptocurrency is the scam that it appears to be, it will nonetheless be allowed to continue because of this particular cryptocurrency’s usefulness to intelligence agencies in funneling money to foreign rebel groups and jihadis with plausible deniability.
Sound crazy? Sound interesting? Strap in, it’s about to get wild.
USDT, or Tether, is what is known as a “stablecoin.” A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that, instead of fluctuating in value, is intended to hold to a consistent price. Tether is a USD stablecoin — each Tether is supposed to be equal in value to one U.S. dollar. While most cryptocurrencies are wildly speculative and backed by essentially nothing, each Tether is supposed to be backed directly by a U.S. dollar, or an extremely liquid, reliable investment like a U.S. treasury bond.
These USD stablecoins are used on cryptocurrency exchanges to conduct on-the-blockchain trades in lieu of using actual U.S. dollars. Without stablecoins like Tether, the current crypto ecosystem simply would not exist. There are multiple USD stablecoins, but Tether is by far the most popular. According to coinmarketcap.com, Tether has the third highest market cap of any crypto currency at $66 billion, trailing only Bitcoin and Ethereum. Today, fully half of all bitcoin trades globally are executed using Tether.
A year ago, crypto news site Protos summarized Tether this way:
If cryptocurrency was an engine, Tether (USDT) is one of its pistons.
Over the past seven years, the maverick stablecoin has evolved into a primary crutch for the ecosystem. It’s a tool for onboarding new money, managing and growing liquidity, pricing digital assets, and generally oiling crypto markets to keep them smooth.
Tether boasted a $1 billion market capitalization when Bitcoin hit $20,000 at the end of 2017. This year, it’s a $70 billion-plus powerhouse.
Practically every crypto exchange supports USDT trade in some form. The makeup of Tether’s reserves and its inner workings are yet to be disclosed in clear detail.
Still, the question of who exactly buys Tether directly from its parent company Bitfinex has remained unanswered since its inception way back in 2014.
Earlier this year, Protos shed light on that mystery by reporting that just two companies, Alameda Research and Cumberland Global, were responsible for seeping roughly two-thirds of all Tether into the crypto ecosystem.
Did that last sentence set off any alarm bells? It should have. Alameda Research is the quantitative trading firm founded by Sam Bankman-Fried. Bankman-Fried and his partner in crime, Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, allegedly propped up their trading firm by plundering FTX customer accounts.
The inner workings of Tether remain remarkably opaque.
New Tethers are supposed to only be minted, and added to the crypto ecosystem, when somebody gives Tether Limited dollars to create them. And if that’s how it all worked, Tether would be fine.
But there is no evidence Tether actually works this way. We repeat: There is no proof that Tether stablecoins are backed by the store of tangible assets that is supposed to justify their value.
Despite first being released eight years ago, Tether has never been audited in any way. It first promised an audit in 2017…to, you know, happen eventually. How is that coming along? As reported by the WSJ, “Tether Says Audit Is Still Months Away as Crypto Market Falters”:
…
Tether is designed to grease the rails of the roughly $1 trillion cryptocurrency market by promising each token can be redeemed for $1. Market observers have long questioned whether the firm’s reserves are sufficient and have been demanding audited information.
The company has been promising an audit since at least 2017. An audit is “likely months” away, said Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer of Tether Holdings Ltd., which issues the tether coin that recently carried a market value of $68 billion.
“Things are going slower than…we would like,” Mr. Ardoino said.
Instead of a full audit, Tether, like other leading stablecoins, publishes an “attestation” showing a snapshot of its reserves and liabilities, signed off by its accounting firm.
Audits are typically more thorough than other types of attestation. The attestations for some crypto companies sign off on the numbers provided by the company’s management for a specific date and time without testing the transactions before or after that date. That process can make the reports more vulnerable to being used to paint an unduly rosy picture.
A 2017 attestation of Tether was skewed by its sister company, Bitfinex, transferring $382 million to its bank account, hours before the accountants checked the numbers, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said last year.
Take a moment to register that: In 2017, when Tether’s total market cap was still under $1 billion, it needed a last-minute transfer of $382 million just to sly its way through a non-audit attestation of its assets. This is ominously reminiscent of the accounting trick used by borrowers to obtain so-called “liar loans” in the run-up to the 2008 subprime mortgage crash.
That 2017 attestation, incidentally, led the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to fine Tether $41 million last year, without the company admitting any wrongdoing. Tether also paid an $18.5 million fine to New York state to settle claims that it misrepresented its reserves. The settlement forced Tether and its associated Bitfinex exchange to cease operations in New York. Crucially, though, none of these fines have fully exposed how Tether works, forced it to change its methods, or even compelled it to admit wrongdoing. Tether essentially made a political payoff, it seems, and moved on.
You know things are fishy when even legendary scammer Jordan Belfort calls you out:
It’s important to state what is happening if Tether is not actually backed by the dollars that it claims. If Tether Limited is pumping out new Tethers without actually taking in an equal amount of USD, then it is essentially a privately-run money printer.
Just manufacture new Tethers, pump them into a crypto exchange, use them to buy bitcoin, then sell the bitcoin for real U.S. dollars.
That would be, in the words of Dire Straits, “Money For Nothing”:
To avoid a Dire Straits situation, in other words, the whole system must place its faith in the unaudited pinky promise of Tether’s management team. So, what remarkable financier is behind this arrangement? What person of impeccable morals is helming Tether such that it commands so much importance in the global crypto ecosystem despite doing so little to merit confidence?
Say, anybody remember the Mighty Ducks movies?
Or how about the Sinbad movie First Kid? Anybody ever catch that on The Disney Channel back in the day?
Meet Brock Pierce.
In the early 90s, Pierce enjoyed a brief career as a child actor. But before even reaching legal adulthood, Pierce pivoted into a new career, which soon ended bizarrely:
In the trailer for First Kid, the forgettable 1996 comedy about a Secret Service agent assigned to protect the president’s son, the title character, played by a teenage Brock Pierce, describes himself as “definitely the most powerful kid in the universe.” Now, the former child star is running to be the most powerful man in the world, as an Independent candidate for President of the United States.
Before First Kid, the Minnesota-born actor secured roles in a series of PG-rated comedies, playing a young Emilio Estevez in The Mighty Ducks, before graduating to smaller parts in movies like Problem Child 3: Junior in Love. When his screen time shrunk, Pierce retired from acting for a real executive role: co-founding the video production start-up Digital Entertainment Network (DEN) alongside businessman Marc Collins-Rector. At age 17, Pierce served as its vice president, taking in a base salary of $250,000.
DEN became “the poster child for dot-com excesses,” raising more than $60 million in seed investments and plotting a $75 million IPO. But it turned into a shorthand for something else when, in October of 1999, the three co-founders suddenly resigned. That month, a New Jersey man filed a lawsuit alleging Collins-Rector had molested him for three years beginning when he was 13 years old. The following summer, three former DEN employees filed a sexual-abuse lawsuit against Pierce, Collins-Rector, and their third co-founder, Chad Shackley. The plaintiffs later dropped their case against Pierce (he made a payment of $21,600 to one of their lawyers) and Shackley. But after a federal grand jury indicted Collins-Rector on criminal charges in 2000, the DEN founders left the country. When Interpol arrested them in 2002, they said they had confiscated “guns, machetes, and child pornography” from the trio’s beach villa in Spain.
Pierce managed to get out of his Interpol jam that without being charged, and his strange path through life continued.
“Wait, is there somehow an Epstein connection here?” you might be wondering. Oh, you bet there is an Epstein connection here.
In early 2011, about a decade after the Digital Entertainment Network imploded, [Brock] Pierce visited the Virgin Islands to attend “Mindshift,” a conference of top scientists hosted by Epstein. A representative for Pierce says he didn’t even know who Epstein was when he flew (commercial) to the event, which the financier had arranged as part of his elaborate effort to launder his lurid reputation. It was not even 18 months after Epstein had completed his slap-on-the-wrist solicitation sentence in Florida and registered as a sex offender.
…
Nothing suggests that anything of a sexual nature or anything untoward at all occurred at Mindshift. Pierce is only one of dozens of figures in Epstein’s dizzyingly vast network, and the link between the two may be nothing but a curiosity. But it is a strange tale: how a former child actor who never went to college ended up as an Epstein guest — a seemingly unlikely addition to a group that included a NASA computer engineer, an MIT professor of electrical engineering and a Nobel laureate in theoretical physics. “I don’t know what he had to do with science [or] why he was there,” says one person who attended.
So, we have the world’s third largest crypto currency, a stablecoin that has never been audited, founded by a washed up former child actor involved in a sex scandal with underaged minors that quietly dissipated without charges, who has prospered in crypto despite zero technical background, and who maintained a hard-to-explain connection to Jeffrey Epstein. But hey, Pierce says he hasn’t actually been involved with Tether since 2015. And maybe Pierce was just the “celebrity” face of the venture, and the other leaders have more legitimate background.
Tether’s CEO is Jean-Louis van der Velde:
The chief executive of Tether ran a company that faced a string of lawsuits in China over unpaid bills and fines for late tax payments before he helped launch the contentious stablecoin now at the heart of the crypto industry.
As crypto has moved from finance’s fringes to its mainstream, investors have increasingly relied on stablecoins, digital tokens backed by real-world assets, as a means to buy and sell volatile currencies such as bitcoin.
But as Tether’s role in the crypto universe has mushroomed since it was founded in 2014, with $78bn of its stablecoins now in circulation, so has scrutiny from regulators. The company’s rapid rise has also turned the spotlight on publicity-shy chief executive Jean-Louis van der Velde.
The 58-year-old Dutch native’s career, spanning IT sales in Hong Kong, Germany’s software industry and an ailing Chinese electronics manufacturer, gave few hints of the significant role he would later assume.
…
While US politicians race to gather more information on Tether, even some of the group’s biggest customers say they have had few dealings with its chief executive.
Sam Bankman-Fried, the chief executive of FTX, the Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange recently valued at $25bn, told the Financial Times earlier this year that he had only met van der Velde once in person.
“My sense is that he’s less involved in the external operations aspect of the business and more involved in internal management and leadership,” Bankman-Fried said. Another cryptocurrency executive who has had dealings with Tether’s management put it more bluntly: “I don’t know a lot about JL and most people don’t.”
Folks, I've been telling you that one day very soon EVERYTHING is going to come out.
The whole crooked and sick system is going to come crashing down on itself.
Can you see how that might happen now?
For years, people thought that would be impossible.
But when you build scam upon scam upon scam, and filth upon filth upon filth, well...sometimes it collapses under its own weight.
And the result is going to be glorious!
It feels like we are very close.
How many people does this take down?
Everyone except those 10-20 honest people in D.C.?
It's very likely.

Now, if you want more of the background here, keep reading...
I'll connect all the dots for you:
EXPOSED IN 90 SECONDS: Biden, Ukraine, Crypto and Pedos....All Connected?
I don't like to use hyperbole too often because then you become the boy who cried wolf and people don't listen to you as much.
So I'm careful with headlines like this, and I wrote this one intentionally because I believe it is true.
Folks, this is the big one, and it may just be the thing that ends up taking down not only Joe Biden but the entire crooked Democrat party.
Let me explain...
You've probably heard about a company called FTX recently and its ""founder"" Sam Bankman-Fried, who goes by ""SBF"".
If you've found the story confusing or too hard to follow, let me explain it really simply, because it is simple.
SBF appears to be a Government spook (or ""Useful Idiot"", we're not sure which yet).
But what is clear is the guy is mostly a complete bumbling idiot, and yet somehow rose to control billions, running one of the largest crypto exchanges out there.
Remember those Super Bowl ads with Tom Brady and Larry David?
That was FTX.
It rose up out of almost nowhere to suddenly be this behemoth.
What we're now learning is the whole thing was perhaps a full ponzi, perhaps just a fraud, perhaps just a total fake, but definitely it was not a real mega-company.
So last week, FTX suddenly shocks everyone and goes bankrupt with no warning.
The crypto market tanked, huge crash.
Bo Polny actually predicted the entire thing, more on that below...
But now as we're putting together the pieces and digging through the wreckage, we're learning this might have actually been the biggest money laundering operation of all time.
Remember all those BILLIONS upon BILLIONS that were going to Ukraine?
What if they were being laundered?
I mean, we all suspected it all along, right?
We just didn't know how the con worked.
Now we're learning, or at least we're starting to connect the dots.
We're still in the early stages here and I want to be clear we're still seeing in a room dimly lit, so this is still speculation at this point, but the puzzle pieces are all starting to fit together.
Here's basically how it went...
The U.S. takes billions upon billions of taxpayer dollars and funnels those over to Ukraine.
Ukraine then puts those billions into FTX (remember, it appears to not be a real company, more like a government plant).
FTX is owned by Sam Bankman-Fried.
SBF then takes the billions and donates them back to the Democrat party.
This part is not speculation: SBF was the #2 largest donor to the Democrats right behind George Soros.
The Democrat party then funnels the money to people like Joe Biden (10% for the Big Guy!) and uses it to buy seats, errrrrrrrr, I mean run elections, in all states at all levels.
End results?
Key Democrats end up with millions...
Races are stolen, errrrrrrrr ""won""...
And Americans are SREWED.
If this all ends up being true or even partially true, I just have one question: Is this treason?

Here is the Daily Caller:
Sam Bankman-Fried, prolific Democratic donor and ex-CEO of now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX, funded the campaigns of members of Congress overseeing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), one of the key bodies tasked with regulating the crypto industry and the subject of Bankman-Fried’s aggressive lobbying.
Bankman-Fried’s FTX is currently under investigation by the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after Bankman-Fried allegedly moved $10 billion in client assets from his crypto exchange to his trading firm Alameda Research, and a liquidity crisis at his exchange which prompted the company to file for bankruptcy. However, prior to the agency’s probe, Bankman-Fried aggressively courted the CFTC – and funded several key lawmakers charged with overseeing the agency, pouring cash into their campaign coffers.
The spectacular meltdown of the FTX crypto exchange has revealed it to be nothing more than a slush fund for Democrat candidates.
Sam Bankman-Fried stepped down as FTX CEO on Friday after it was announced his exchange had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the face of a multi-billion dollar liquidity crunch.
On midterm election day, Bankman-Fried managed to lose nearly 94% of his estimated $15.6 billion fortune.
The U.S. branch of FTX is now valued at $1, down from a peak of $8 billion in January. Bankman-Fried is now also under investigation by both the Department of Justice and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Prior to the midterms, Bankman-Fried was touted by POLITICO as the Democrats’ “newest megadonor” and “potential Democrat savior” second only to billionaire globalist George Soros.
“We’ve never seen something like this on this scale,” said Bradley Beychok, co-founder of American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic super PAC. “On our side, there’s a small pool of people who write these kinds of checks and they tend to be the same folks. But Sam, to his credit, came right in with a big splash.”
In fact, Bankman-Fried spent almost $40 million on Democrat candidates this year.
The 30-year-old Bankman-Fried has been a major force in Democratic politics, ranking as the party’s second-biggest individual donor in the 2021–2022 election cycle, according to Open Secrets, with donations totaling $39.8 million. That ranks only behind George Soros (about $128 million) but ahead of many other big names, including Michael Bloomberg ($28.3 million). What’s more, he had promised to spend far more on Democrats moving forward, predicting in May that he’d fund “north of $100 million” and had a “soft ceiling” of $1 billion for the 2024 elections.
He also donated $10 million to then-candidate Joe Biden in 2020.
A YouTuber named “Nobody Special Finance” succinctly explained the FTX “Ponzi scheme” that led to its collapse this week.
“The truth is, Sam Bankman-Fried is a liar and a crook,” said Nobody Special. “His personal crypto, FTX Token, was basically a Ponzi scheme … He used his Ponzi token as collateral to borrow billions of real dollars that he couldn’t pay back … He then used those real dollars to build an empire out of dying companies.”
“[Sam Bankman-Fried] then sold people cryptos like Bitcoin, or so they thought. What they really bought was an IOU.”
In essence, Bankman-Fried used his corrupt earnings to finance the Democrats’ midterm races to head off a “Red Wave.”
Now that FTX has imploded, Democrats are saving face by renewing calls for the crypto space to be heavily regulated.

RT rpeorts: Speaking to his supporters and the media on Sunday night after his landslide presidential election victory, Putin stressed that Moscow is well aware of calls in the US-led military bloc to potentially deploy troops to Ukraine.
“We hear both French and English speech there. There is nothing good in this, first of all for them, because they die there and in large numbers,” he said.
Putin also weighed in on the potential for a full-scale conflict between NATO and Russia, warning that it could not be ruled out. “Anything is possible in the modern world… But everyone knows that this would be one step shy of a full-scale World War III. I don’t think that anyone is interested in that.”
French President Emmanuel Macron suggested last month that the West “cannot exclude” the possibility of sending soldiers to aid Ukraine. He later described Russia as an “adversary,” insisting, however, that Paris is not “waging war on” Moscow.
Commenting on Macron’s remarks, Putin noted that while NATO troops in Ukraine are expected to act as an auxiliary force, helping Kiev train its military, “this is not much different from what mercenaries are doing there now.” Russia, he added, wants France not to escalate the conflict but to help find a peaceful solution to hostilities."
5230,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-02-22,"The city of Columbia, Missouri, has declared itself a sanctuary for LGBTQ residents.
Columbia City Council members passed the ‘LGBTQ Safe Haven’ ordinance in a 6 to 1 vote.
The sanctuary city ordinance includes language “referencing potential future state laws barring bathroom access for transgender individuals or public drag performances,” Columbia Daily Tribune reports.
“Columbia City Council members passed an ordinance by a vote of 6 to 1 that ensured LGBTQ individuals, families, and establishments felt safe within the community,” KRCG 13 reporter Mark Slavit wrote.

Ward 5 council member Don Waterman was the lone dissenting vote.
Public comment on the ordinance lasted approximately three hours before the council vote.
“That said, this ordinance for me is not really necessary. I base that on several things,” Waterman commented.
According to the Columbia Daily Tribune, Waterman felt Columbia was already considered a safe haven, wouldn’t change the hearts or minds of residents, and wouldn’t impact existing state laws.
The ordinance ensured LGBTQ individuals, families, and establishments felt safe within the community. Those who gave public comment on the ordinance waited in a line from the speaker’s podium to outside of the council chamber. Mid-Missouri Pride Fest spokesman Joe Jefferies told city leaders it was important that Columbia had the title of a Sanctuary City for Queer Missourians.
Jefferies said, “This ordinance is not merely a political statement or gesture of performant tokenism. It is a vital step toward safeguarding the human rights of queer Columbians, enabling them to thrive safely within Columbia’s city limits.”
Fifth Ward Councilman Don Waterman was the only member of the council to vote no on the ordinance. Waterman heard complaints from transgenders during the public comment about trouble in public bathrooms and bullying. Waterman said the ordinance would not prevent those problems.

From the Columbia Daily Tribune:
“I would wholeheartedly support a resolution, but an ordinance, I don’t see the need for it,” Waterman said, which mirrored his statements from December on a preference for a city resolution rather than an ordinance.
Public comments Monday in favor of passage encouraged adoption of the amendments as there is at least one Missouri bill focused on transgender bathroom and locker room access and at least two banning public drag performances. Personal experiences living in Columbia also were cited.
Comments against the ordinance cited city protections already in place, seeming creation of special protected classes and concerns it still could mean skirting of state law, among others."

TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — The speaker of the Georgian parliament signed into a law Thursday a bill that severely curtails LGBTQ+ rights in the country and mirrors legislation adopted in neighboring Russia.
Shalva Papuashvili, the parliament speaker, said on social media that the legislation does “not reflect current, temporary, changing ideas and ideologies, but is based on common sense, historical experience and centuries-old Christian, Georgian and European values.”
Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili had refused to sign the bill and returned it to parliament on Wednesday. It was introduced by the governing Georgian Dream party and approved by lawmakers last month.
The bill includes bans on same-sex marriages, adoptions by same-sex couples and public endorsement and depictions of LGBTQ+ relations and people in the media. It also bans gender-affirming care and changing gender designations in official documents.
“This law protects the rights of all citizens, including freedom of expression, so that the rights of others are not violated, which is the essence and idea of true democracy,” Papuashvili wrote.
Parliament gave the legislation its final approval as Georgia, a largely conservative country where the Orthodox Church wields significant influence, prepares to vote in a parliamentary election. The law has been widely seen as an effort by the governing party to shore up support among conservative groups. It was decried by human rights advocates and LGBTQ+ activists, who said it further marginalized an already vulnerable community.
By signing the law, Georgian Dream “have taken homophobia to a new level, and that is political and institutional homophobia,” said Ana Tavadze, an activist with Tbilisi Pride, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group.
Georgian Dream’s aim is to “fabricate” problems ahead of the election to distract people from “their failure” to solve issues involving unemployment, education and healthcare, Tavadze told The Associated Press.
The law has drawn comparisons with Russia, where the Kremlin has been highlighting what it calls traditional family values. Russian authorities in the last decade have banned public endorsement of “nontraditional sexual relations” and introduced laws against gender-affirming care, among other measures. Its Supreme Court effectively outlawed LGBTQ+ activism by labeling what the authorities called the LGBTQ+ “movement” operating in Russia as an extremist organization and banning it.
In Georgia, the LGBTQ+ community has struggled even before the legislation was introduced. Demonstrations and violent outbursts against LGBTQ+ people have been common, and last year hundreds of opponents of gay rights stormed an LGBTQ+ festival in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, forcing the event’s cancellation. This year, tens of thousands marched in Tbilisi to promote “traditional family values.”
A day after parliament gave its final approval to the anti-LGBTQ+ bill, transgender actor and model Kesaria Avramidze was stabbed to death in her apartment in Tbilisi. Rights advocates had worried that the bill would stoke more violence.
Papuashvili, the parliament speaker, said that by not signing the bill, President Zourabichvili and the Georgian opposition “did not have enough courage to openly express their opinion regarding this law.”
Some analysts say parts of the Georgian opposition are walking a fine line ahead of the Oct. 26 election between condemning the move to curtail LGBTQ+ rights and not wanting to alienate some voters.
Zourabichvili has long been at odds with the governing party and vetoed a “foreign influence” law adopted by parliament earlier this year. She was overridden by parliament, where Georgian Dream dominates.
The measure requires media and nongovernmental organizations to register as “pursuing the interests of a foreign power” if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad. It ignited weeks of protests and was widely criticized as threatening democratic freedoms. Those opposing the law compared it to similar legislation in Russia which is routinely used to suppress dissent, and accused the governing party of acting in concert with Moscow, jeopardizing Georgia’s chances of joining the European Union.
The South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million formally applied to join the EU in 2022, after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but the bloc halted its accession in response to the “foreign influence” law and froze some of its financial support. The United States imposed sanctions on dozens of Georgian officials in response to the law.
Georgian Dream was set up by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia and served briefly as Georgia’s prime minister in 2012. It promised to restore civil rights and “reset” relations with Moscow, which fought a brief war with Georgia in 2008 over the breakaway province of South Ossetia. Russia then recognized the independence of South Ossetia and another breakaway Georgian province, Abkhazia, and established military bases there.
Many Georgians backed Ukraine as Kyiv battled Russia’s invasion in 2022. But the Georgian government abstained from joining sanctions against Moscow, barred dozens of Kremlin critics from entering the country, and accused the West of trying to drag Georgia into open conflict with Russia. The opposition has accused the governing party of steering the country into Russia’s orbit to the detriment of its European aspirations."
2277,real,ANTI_MIGRATION_AND_XENOPHOBIA,2024-05-14,"EU government ministers approved 10 legislative parts of The New Pact on Migration and Asylum. It lays out rules for the 27 member countries to handle people trying to enter without authorization, from how to screen them to establish whether they qualify for protection to deporting them if they’re not allowed to stay.
Hungary and Poland, which have long opposed any obligation for countries to host migrants or pay for their upkeep, voted against the package but were unable to block it.
Mainstream political parties believe the pact resolves the issues that have divided member nations since well over 1 million migrants swept into Europe in 2015, most fleeing war in Syria and Iraq. They hope the system will starve the far right of vote-winning oxygen in the June 6-9 elections.
However, the vast reform package will only enter force in 2026, bringing no immediate fix to an issue that has fueled one of the EU’s biggest political crises, dividing nations over who should take responsibility for migrants when they arrive and whether other countries should be obligated to help.
Critics say the pact will let nations detain migrants at borders and fingerprint children. They say it’s aimed at keeping people out and infringes on their right to claim asylum. Many fear it will result in more unscrupulous deals with poorer countries that people leave or cross to get to Europe.
Read more'The Cursed': Former migrants rejected by society on return to Ivory Coast
Europe’s asylum laws have not been updated for about two decades. The system frayed and then fell apart in 2015. It was based on the premise that migrants should be processed, given asylum or deported in the country they first enter. Greece, Italy and Malta were left to shoulder most of the financial burden and deal with public discontent. Since then, the ID-check-free zone known as the Schengen Area has expanded to 27 countries, 23 of them EU members. It means that more than 400 million Europeans and visitors, including refugees, are able to move without showing travel documents.
Some 3.5 million migrants arrived legally in Europe in 2023. Around 1 million others were on EU territory without permission. Of the latter, most were people who entered normally via airports and ports with visas but didn’t go home when they expired. The pact applies to the remaining minority, estimated at around 300,000 migrants last year. They are people caught crossing an external EU border without permission, such as those reaching the shores of Greece, Italy or Spain via the Mediterranean Sea or Atlantic Ocean on boats provided by smugglers.
The country on whose territory people land will screen them at or near the border. This involves identity and other checks – including on children as young as 6. The information will be stored on a massive new database, Eurodac. This screening should determine whether a person might pose a health or security risk and their chances of being permitted to stay. Generally, people fleeing conflict, persecution or violence qualify for asylum. Those looking for jobs are likely to be refused entry. Screening is mandatory and should take no longer than seven days. It should lead to one of two things: an application for international protection, like asylum, or deportation to their home country.

People seeking asylum must apply in the EU nation they first enter and stay until the authorities there work out what country should handle their application. It could be that they have family, cultural or other links somewhere else, making it more logical for them to be moved. The border procedure should be done in 12 weeks, including time for one legal appeal if their application is rejected. It could be extended by eight weeks in times of mass movements of people. Procedures could be faster for applicants from countries whose citizens are not often granted asylum. Critics say this undermines asylum law because applicants should be assessed individually, not based on nationality. People would stay in “reception centers” while it happens, with access to health care and education. Those rejected would receive a deportation order.
To speed things up, a deportation order is supposed to be issued automatically when an asylum request is refused. A new 12-week period is foreseen to complete this process. The authorities may detain people throughout. The EU’s border and coast guard agency would help organize joint deportation flights. Currently, less than one in three people issued with an order to leave are deported. This is often due to a lack of cooperation from the countries these people come from.
The new rules oblige countries to help an EU partner under migratory pressure. Support is mandatory, but flexible. Nations can relocate asylum applicants to their territory or choose some other form of assistance. This could be financial – a relocation is evaluated at 20,000 euros ($21,462) per person – technical or logistical. Members can also assume responsibility for deporting people from the partner country in trouble.
Two issues stand out: Will member countries ever fully enact the plan, and will the EU’s executive branch, the European Commission, enforce the new rules when it has chosen not to apply the ones already in place? The commission is due to present a Common Implementation Plan by June. It charts a path and timeline to get the pact working over the next two years, with targets that the EU and member countries should reach. Things could get off to a rocky start. Hungary, which has vehemently opposed the reforms, takes over the EU’s agenda-setting presidency for six months on July 1.

5440,real,ANTI_MIGRATION_AND_XENOPHOBIA,2024-09-19,"Africans who apply for Schengen visas face high rejection rates – migration scholar explains why
Africans face a high rejection rate for visas to enter the Schengen group of countries. The group is made up of 29 European countries that have officially abolished border controls at their mutual borders. A Schengen visa is an entry permit for non-EU nationals which would allow them to make a short, temporary visit of up to 90 days in the Schengen area.
In 2023, the Schengen states generated US$906 million from visa applications, of which US$145 million came from rejected visa applications. These refusals in 2023 cost African nationals US$61 million in application fees.
A recent report by the British migration consultancy Henley & Partners shows that African countries accounted for seven of the top ten countries with the highest Schengen visa rejection rates in 2022. The Conversation Africa’s Godfred Akoto Boafo asks migration scholar Mehari Taddele Maru, who contributed to the report, why rejection rates for Africans are so high.
Whose visa applications are rejected?
I analysed the EU’s data on visa applications between 2009 and 2023 and found a dramatic increase in the rate of rejection for Schengen visa applicants. In 2014, 18% of African visa applications were rejected, while the global rejection rate was 5%. By 2022, the rejection rate for African applicants had risen to 30%, and the global rate increased to 17.5%.
Of the top 10 countries with high Schengen visa rejection rates in 2022, seven were from Africa. Among these were Algeria, Guinea-Bissau, Nigeria and Ghana.
The increase in visa rejection rates is associated with the EU’s visa policy.
We also identified two key factors – income and passport power – that may explain why African applicants face higher Schengen visa rejection rates.
Rich countries with high income levels (measured by GDP and GNI) usually have stronger passports (as measured by Henley Passport Power, an index based on International Air Transport Authority data). This means their citizens can visit several countries without visas. A strong passport gives people mobility in search of economic opportunities.
In contrast, people from poorer countries (including most African nations) have weaker passports. This means their travel options are significantly reduced without visas.
We also uncovered a link between African countries’ low rankings in national income and passport power indices and higher rates of visa rejection.
Consequently, it is harder for Africans to travel as their visa applications are more likely to be rejected.
Why are visa applications rejected?
Officially, visa rejections are often attributed to doubts about an applicant’s intention to leave the destination country before the visa expires. According to European states, most rejections are based on reasonable doubts about the visa applicant’s intention to return home.
As provided under the EU Visa Code Handbook, the assessment of a visa applicant’s intention to return home is based on circumstantial evidence. Consular officers have broad powers of discretion to decide this. They consider three key factors through documentation:
the stability of the applicant’s socio-economic situation in their country of residence
proof of employment or business activities
family and community ties.
Supporting documents may include proof of financial means, property ownership, employment contracts, business records and travel arrangements. The most favourable visa candidates often demonstrate strong ties to their home country. This includes dependent family members staying behind or property ownership.
In my view this potentially allows discrimination based on nationality and geographical factors. In the Schengen visa regime, proof of intention to return home is often linked to the economic status of applicants and their nationality. With an elastic concept such as this, the Schengen visa regime allows immigration officials in the global south to filter visa applicants based on their economic conditions and country of origin. In my research, there is no evidence to suggest that a higher rejection rate leads to a decrease in irregular migration or visa overstays.
The findings highlight visa policies that disproportionately affect Africans seeking to visit Europe. They undermine the European Union’s stated commitment to strengthening partnerships with Africa.
What needs to change?
Europe’s poor efforts in improving legal mobility pathways for Africans have left many, including governments, disillusioned about migration cooperation between Africa and Europe. Despite promises of visa facilitation, family reunification and labour migration, progress remains elusive. The few legal avenues available mostly benefit skilled workers from within the European Union.
The European Union must reform its visa regime and expand legal migration pathways. But ultimately, the primary responsibility lies with African states. They must create an environment in which their citizens can thrive and prosper within the continent. This includes investing in economic development, job creation, education, healthcare and infrastructure.
African governments should ratify the 2018 African Union protocol on free movement of Africans within their continent. Six years after its adoption, only four countries have ratified the protocol: Mali, Niger, Rwanda, and São Tomé & Principe.
In contrast, the agreement establishing the African Continental Free Trade Area, which focuses on the movement of goods, services, and capital, has been in force since 2019, just a year after its adoption.
Reforming the Schengen group’s visa policies towards Africa goes beyond just migration management. It is about getting politics right in Europe. If Europe is serious about partnering with Africa and addressing its demand for labour, the benefits of expanding legal pathways for Africans far outweigh the costs.

2138,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-04-26,"If you only have a minute:
According to a tweet from the Russian Embassy in South Africa, foreign mercenaries recruited by Ukraine are said to have committed atrocities against civilians. To support its claims, the embassy shared an article from a purported news site, the Boston Times.
The source is unreliable: the Boston Times site uses the name of a newspaper that doesn't exist anymore, and its website appears to be a conduit for anti-Ukrainian and pro-Israeli disinformation.
The article cited by the Russian embassy also mentions unverified accusations from an NGO founded by Yevgeny Prigozhin, the former head of the mercenary Wagner Group.
The fact-check, in detail
""Foreign mercenaries in Ukraine commit horrific atrocities against civilians,"" said the X account of the Russian embassy in South Africa on April 9. Citing an article from an unknown media outlet, the Boston Times, the embassy denounced what it described as the ""impunity and immunity"" granted by the ""Zelensky administration"" regarding ""torture"" and ""rape"" inflicted by foreign mercenaries.
The Boston Times appears to be a site designed to spread disinformation. Moreover, the atrocities mentioned by the Russian embassy are not supported by any verifiable evidence.
A fake site of a defunct newspaper
Several elements indicate that the Boston Times website, bostontimes.org, is not a real media outlet.
The website uses the name of a now-defunct newspaper, the Boston Times. Archives of the US Library of Congress confirm the existence of a newspaper named ""the Boston Times."" Its publication began in 1887, and its last recorded issue was published in 1943.
Bostontimes.org states in its About section that the media outlet was established in Boston in 1972, but there is no evidence that such an outlet exists in the city.
The website's logo was also likely created through artificial intelligence. The text in the logo is inconsistent, with the word in the bottom right corner being meaningless in English – it's a hint that the image was artificially generated.
An article illustrated with out-of-context photographs
The article also presents inconsistencies or lacks context in the information it provides about the alleged atrocities committed by mercenaries of the Ukrainian army.
The article shows a photograph of a child wandering in the ruins of his village, but it is not specified that this is a staged scene. By using reverse image search techniques, it is possible to find the original photograph.
The picture is taken from a music video clip, ""Angel, a song about the children of Donbass,"" shot by a pro-Russian director in 2015, seven years before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia. However, in the article, the alleged atrocities committed by foreign mercenaries were claimed to have occurred from the summer of 2022 onward. The photograph can be seen at 0'51 in the video.
The Boston Times article also presents a photograph of a Ukrainian tank in front of a body to illustrate the atrocities allegedly committed by foreign mercenaries. By conducting a reverse image search, it is possible to find its context.
The photograph was taken shortly after the Bucha massacre committed in April 2022 by the Russian army against Ukrainians. It was taken by a photographer from Reuters, Zohra Bensemra. According to residents, the image shows Ukrainian soldiers in front of the body of a civilian killed by Russian soldiers.
Prigozhin's former protégé as a source
The main source of the article is particularly problematic: Mira Terada, president of the ""Foundation to Battle Injustice"" or 'FBI', an NGO founded by the deceased head of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin. Mira Terada, whose real name is Oksana Vovk, was considered before the oligarch's death to be Prigozhin's ""protégé.""
Presenting itself as an organisation seeking to combat human rights violations, the Foundation to Battle Injustice has been responsible for disinformation campaigns in the past, notably against the French army, against which it made unfounded accusations of kidnapping children in Niger for the purpose of sexual slavery.
In the article, Mira Terada provides no details of the supposed atrocities. She does not cite the locations of the atrocities, their dates, their alleged perpetrators, or their victims, making independent verification of her claims impossible.
Russia regularly accuses several states supporting Ukraine, including France, of deploying mercenaries in the country. On January 16, Moscow boasted of carrying out a precision strike on a foreign fighter deployment point in Kharkiv, the core of which consisted of ""French mercenaries"".
This was categorically denied by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which denounced it as a ""gross Russian manipulation,"" stating that France has no mercenaries ""neither in Ukraine nor elsewhere, unlike other nations""."
2428,real,INSTITUTIONAL_AND_MEDIA_DISTRUST_PUBLIC_INSTITUTIONS,2024-03-13,"The law includes protections for the secrecy of journalists's sources and a ban on using spyware against journalists.
The legislation, backed in a vote by 464 EU lawmakers, with 92 against and 65 abstaining, also enshrines editorial independence and seeks to improve transparency on media ownership.
The law still needs to be adopted by the EU's 27 member countries before it can come into force.
The European Union commissioner for values and transparency, Vera Jourova, hailed the ""historic vote"", saying on X that ""independent media are essential to democracies"" and ""it's the duty of democracies to protect them"".
Reports Without Borders (RSF), a media watchdog advocating journalist safety and independence, also welcomed the vote.
""This law's adoption marks a major step forward for the right to information within the European Union,"" said RSF's Brussels office chief Julie Majerczak.
She called for EU member countries to ""ambitiously"" implement the law.
The draft text of the European Media Freedom Act was introduced by the European Commission in 2022 in reaction to deteriorating media pluralism and independence in EU countries such as Hungary and Poland, and also as spyware like Pegasus and Predator was being used to target journalists.
Jourova said in a Tuesday debate on the law in the European Parliament in Strasbourg ahead of the vote that its provisions address ""clear problems"" facing media in Europe.
Those included ""interference by governments in editorial decisions, pressure on media of public service, media surveillance of journalists, lack of transparency of media ownership and of state advertising, or lack of coordination among media regulators"".
The lead lawmaker shepherding the law through parliament, Sabine Verheyen, highlighted not only ""threats to media freedom in Hungary"" but also the October 16, 2017 murder of a Maltese investigative journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia.
Malta's prime minister at the time, Joseph Muscat, was forced to resign after mass protests over perceived efforts to protect friends and allies in the ensuing investigation.
Three hitmen convicted of the car bomb killing -- Vincent Muscat (no relation to the former prime minister) and brothers George and Alfred Degiorgio -- were sentenced in 2021 and 2022 to, respectively 15 years and 40 years in prison.
The European Parliament today has a room named in Caruana Galizia's honour and gives an annual journalism award in her name.
Limited exceptions
During negotiations on the new law, France insisted on ""national security"" carve-outs, sparking concerns among journalists and media-freedom organisations.
Exceptions are included in the final law, but not for national security reasons, and only in limited circumstances.
For instance, spyware on devices used by journalists can only be deployed if a number of serious violations are identified, and then only after sign-off from a judicial or independent authority.
EU countries will also be required to ensure sustainable financing of public media organisations, and there are safeguards for journalistic content published online.
The legislation contains provisions for setting up an independent EU committee composed of representatives from national regulatory authorities to examine cases where overconcentration of media ownership might infringe the rules.
The panel would issue recommendations -- nonbinding ones -- in regards to media pluralism.

3741,fake,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-09-12,"The company made this admission in patent filings disclosed by Dr. Robert Malone, the inventor of mRNA vaccine technology, during a hearing led by U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA). According to Malone, Moderna's patent shows that its vaccine contains billions of DNA fragments and other contaminants linked to birth defects and cancer.
The expert also mentioned that Moderna's patent acknowledges that RNA is preferable to DNA in vaccines. However, the vaccine maker also acknowledges the contamination risk involved with its COVID-19 vaccine that was injected into the arms of millions.
Malone testified: ""Moderna has a patent on the use of RNA for vaccines. And in that, Moderna explicitly acknowledges that RNA is superior to DNA for vaccine purposes [despite] problems, including the possibility of insertional mutagenesis that could lead to the activation of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes.
""[The Food and Drug Administration] FDA says they're not aware of any concerns. But Moderna, in its own patent, lays out exactly the same concerns that exist about DNA. So Moderna knows it – DNA is a contaminant.
""It is left in because of the way they make it. They use DNA to make RNA, and then they degrade the DNA. [Afterward,] they have to purify the degraded DNA away from the RNA – and the process they are using is not that good.""
According to the Daily Expose, scientists from the U.S. and Canada managed to procure unopened vials of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine with a clear chain of custody. They proceeded to take samples from these and examine them, discovering large numbers of DNA fragments in the RNA preparation.
The scientists then applied standard reconstruction tools to see what the circular plasmid DNAs looked like. According to Malone, the findings suggest the presence of certain DNA sequences in the vials normally not allowed in anything that is going to go into humans – ""not the least of which is an antibiotic resistance gene.""
""They include these sequences from Simian Virus 40 (SV40) – not the whole virus, but highly active promoter sequences. [This] is exactly the thing that the FDA, in their older regulations, said must be avoided because it confers even more risk for insertional mutagenesis,"" the mRNA vaccine technology inventor noted.
But the problem isn't just present in Moderna's mRNA COVID-19 injection. Pfizer's mRNA vaccine, produced in cooperation with German company BioNTech, also contained the same contaminants.
The New York-based Pfizer provided documentation about its COVID-19 injection to regulators in the U.S., Europe and Canada. However, the regulators deleted the little notation about SV40 sequences Pfizer wrote in filings – apparently in an attempt to hide it from the public.
""The FDA didn't take the raw DNA sequences, reconstruct those plasmid maps, and look at them themselves,"" Malone clarified. ""They just took for granted what Pfizer had given them. And now this is all coming out because of what these researchers found."" (Related: Health Canada confirms that Pfizer COVID-19 injections contain SV40 DNA sequence that can cause CANCER.)
According to Malone, high-level people at both Moderna and Pfizer had to have known the dangers their COVID-19 vaccines pose to the world. The potential consequences for those injected with the poison shot include ""anything that is associated with DNA damage, i.e., birth defects and cancer being the most notable ones.""

RFE/RL's Ukraine Live Briefing gives you the latest developments on Russia's invasion, Western military aid, the plight of civilians, and territorial control maps. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.
""In the coming months, the United States will provide Ukraine with a range of additional capabilities, including hundreds of air-defense interceptors, dozens of tactical air-defense systems, additional artillery systems, significant quantities of ammunition, hundreds of armored personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles, and thousands of additional armored vehicles, all of which will help to equip Ukraine's armed forces,"" the statement said.
During the phone call, Zelenskiy updated Biden on his plan to achieve victory over Russia, and the two leaders ""tasked their teams to engage in further consultations on next steps,"" the statement said.
Biden aims to shore up U.S. military support for Ukraine ahead of the November 5 election, which could return President Donald Trump to the White House in January. Trump has indicated he would seek to end the war quickly through negotiations, and many Republicans in Congress, including Trump's running mate, Senator J.D. Vance (Republican-Ohio), have opposed sending more military aid to Ukraine.
Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, have criticized Trump for saying he could quickly end the war, saying this would only allow Moscow to hold on to the parts of Ukraine that it currently occupies and seek further gains.
The White House statement said Biden and Zelenskiy committed to intensify security-assistance planning alongside Ukraine's international partners in order to ensure that Kyiv has the equipment it needs to prevail.
As part of this effort, Biden will host a virtual meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in November to coordinate their additional assistance, the statements said.
White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said earlier on October 16 that U.S. support for Ukraine will be a big part of Biden's trip to Germany later this week.
Biden will not be able to meet with Zelenskiy while he is in Europe, but Jean-Pierre said that the United States wants to ""be there for the Ukrainians"" as they continue to battle Russian forces.
Biden rescheduled his visit to Germany after his original travel plan had to be scrapped last week because of Hurricane Milton."
3654,fake,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-09-25,"Dr. Shoemaker, a courageous whistleblower of the whole scamdemic, emphatically added that hydroxychloroquine was also a known go-to cure for Covid. Both of these antidotes were “highly antiviral and immune modulatory, and those two things were the key.” He said both elements were “totally proven” and “of course, we knew it was completely safe for humans, because these medications have been used for 35 to 40 years in humans, so that’s what was sitting there, ready to be used at the next pandemic.”
Dr. Shoemaker, a very knowledgeable physician, describes a stunning amount of data revealing that the vaccine actually helps children and society to contract Covid, and he also says we should all avoid the dirty, deadly mRNA vaccines. He said the vaccines RAISE death rates to significantly high numbers in children, youth and young adults.
This is exactly why the CDC and FDA strictly prohibited medical doctors from prescribing Ivermectin to patients before and during their Covid attacks, so that the virus numbers and death tolls would skyrocket, enabling Big Government to take away American’s medical freedom of choice, constitutional rights to free speech and free press, and help Big Pharma bankroll off the Fauci Flu trillion-dollar cash cow.
This testimony by Dr. Shoemaker is another smoking gun about how the whole pandemic really was a PLANDEMIC, including the lab-made gain-of-function virus, the deadliest vaccines to follow, and the absolute censorship and disinformation campaign about the best cures for Covid.
Mainstream media was the “right arm” of Big Pharma, pushing all the lies and disinformation on the masses, around the globe, but especially in America. It’s unbelievable that nobody is in prison for it. Not one single politician, scientist, disease “expert,” reporter, news pundit, talk show host, Biden, Harris, nobody. Where is justice? People should be on trial for mass murder, conspiracy to commit murder, possession and distribution of (mRNA and Covid) biological weapons of mass destruction. It’s vaccine violence.
Ivermectin was identified by DARPA Biological Technologies as a curative, in April 2020, for Covid, and was declared through scientific evaluation to work throughout all phases of Covid illness because it both “inhibits viral replication and modulates the immune response.”
To add insult to injury, take a look at the VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Report System) graph for the first 14 days after the masses got vaccinated for Covid, and check out the mass-murdering first TWO DAYS after the injections were administered. These folks were listed by the corrupt Vaccine Industrial Complex as “unvaccinated” so that the massive death toll wouldn’t be documented properly for all to see.

3649,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-07-26,"Ozempic's biggest side effect: Turning Denmark into a 'pharmastate'?
What if your entire economy was based on one product? TV commercials joke that America runs on Dunkin', but for all intents and purposes, Denmark quite literally runs on Ozempic, a diabetes medication that is now widely used by consumers to lose weight.
Ozempic is proving to be a powerful growth engine. Its worldwide sales have increased by over 60% in the past year alone. In the United States, which is one of its largest markets, prescriptions for Ozempic and similar drugs quadrupled between 2020 and 2022. And even with those blockbuster sales, demand is so high that there has been a persistent shortage of Ozempic in the U.S. for a large part of the past few years.
Ozempic's manufacturer, the Danish company Novo Nordisk, is reaping the fruits of the craze. Its net profit more than doubled between 2019 and 2023, and its stock has soared to new heights. At the end of 2023, Novo became the largest company in Europe. And its rise has eclipsed the Danish economy, creating a lot of value on the one hand, but an imbalanced economy on the other.
You might have heard of ""petrostates,"" countries where fossil fuel extraction dominates the economy. By that measure, you might call Denmark a pharmastate, because Novo now dominates the Danish economy.
Nearly 1 out of every 5 Danish jobs created last year was at Novo. And that's just directly. If you also include the jobs that Novo has created indirectly — like, for example, at its suppliers, or from all the newly wealthy Novo employees spending their money at shops and restaurants — nearly half of all private-sector nonfarm jobs created in Denmark can be traced back to Novo.
More than that, Denmark's gross domestic product would have shrunk last year without the contribution of the pharma sector. In other words, the company has almost single-handedly rescued the country from a recession.
Novo Nordisk's meteoric trajectory raises a question about economic growth that's much bigger than just Denmark: Namely, what are the risks of having one giant company driving your entire economy? And crucially, what happens if that company's fortunes take a turn for the worse?
Danish disease
In economics, too much of a good thing can sometimes be a bad thing. One such case is a phenomenon called Dutch disease, named after the experience of the Netherlands in the 1960s. And some economists worry that Novo Nordisk's rise may cause Denmark to suffer from it too (for more on Dutch disease, listen to this episode of The Indicator from Planet Money).
When the Dutch discovered vast natural gas deposits in Groningen in 1959, they started extracting and exporting the gas as fast as possible. The high exports increased demand for the Dutch currency, the guilder, which caused its value to skyrocket relative to other currencies. And that in turn made other, non-gas Dutch exports too expensive to compete on international markets. This ultimately decimated the manufacturing sector and raised unemployment in the country. Paradoxically, the huge windfall ended up hurting the economy.
Dutch disease is usually associated with the discovery of natural resources like oil or gas, but it can happen from any development that causes a spike in global demand for a currency. Such as: the discovery of a miraculous weight loss drug that everyone in the world wants to buy.
Indeed, Novo's surging drug sales have boosted Danish exports and brought a lot of foreign currency into Denmark. For instance, the bulk of Novo's sales come from North America. Novo then has to exchange a large amount of the foreign currency it earned abroad into Danish kroner to pay its employees' salaries and its taxes in Denmark, expand its factories there and so on. This puts pressure on the krone to increase in value relative to other currencies, like the dollar.
However, the krone isn't allowed to increase much in value because Denmark keeps its exchange rate fixed to the euro. To offset the strengthening effect on the currency, Denmark's central bank has had to respond by keeping interest rates low. ""It may seem strange that weight loss medicine affects interest rates in Denmark, but it does,"" Jens Nærvig Pedersen, director of foreign exchange market and rates strategy at Danske Bank, told Bloomberg.
Novo's activities have had a noticeable effect on the krone, but the central bank's interventions have been sufficient to keep its value stable. Though a fixed exchange rate can't always save you from Dutch disease, Denmark has managed to avoid it so far, and it continues to export a wide variety of goods today. And the central bank continues to monitor Novo's effect on the currency.
The new Nokia
The dominance of Novo Nordisk in the Danish economy has prompted many to caution Denmark against falling into the same trap that its Nordic neighbor Finland fell victim to years ago: the Nokia trap.
Back in the early 2000s, Nokia, a telecommunications company, was the hottest game in town. The appeal of its iconic brick phone has long since been forgotten in the shadow of a new generation of smartphones, but in the early 2000s, Nokia was the world's largest maker of mobile phones. And like Novo Nordisk, it was a business behemoth in its home country: In its heyday, Nokia was responsible for almost a quarter of Finnish growth and generated over 20% of Finland's exports.
But then disaster struck: In the mid-to-late 2000s, Nokia started rapidly losing market share to Apple and other smartphone manufacturers. The global financial crisis hit at the same time, and Finland's economy was sent into a tailspin. Compared with its Nordic neighbors, Finland's economic decline was steeper, and its post-crisis recovery was much slower.
The widespread perception was that Nokia's downfall took the Finnish economy down. ""Steve Jobs took our jobs,"" the then-prime minister said in an interview. The geographic proximity and economic similarity of the situation raise a question: Is Denmark in danger of falling into the Nokia trap too?
As is often the case with economics, the real answer is complex. To start, Nokia's circumstances were quite extreme. It might be unusual to have a company of Nokia's size in a small open economy like Finland, but it's even more unusual to have a company go from being the global market leader to cutting tens of thousands of jobs and getting acquired by another company within the space of a few years.
The fact that the global financial crisis happened at the same time also meant that many of the factors at the root of Finland's economic troubles were unrelated to Nokia. The Research Institute of the Finnish Economy estimated that Nokia's direct contribution accounted for over 30% of the GDP decline and 20% of the employment decline between 2008 and 2014. That is an astounding amount for one company to be responsible for, but it's nowhere near the majority.
While it's unlikely that Novo will suffer from a Nokia-style collapse soon, some obstacles are on the horizon that could hamper its growth in the future. Countries are already talking about implementing stricter price controls on Novo's drugs, and Novo's patents on Ozempic expire within a decade, at which point it will probably have to fight against a wave of competition from generic-drug manufacturers. And as we see from the data, if Novo stops growing, Denmark likely stops growing too. That's the Nokia trap for Denmark.
The best way to avoid this would be for other Danish companies to grow faster and generate more value, so that economic growth in the nation becomes driven by many companies rather than one. But that's easier said than done, especially given Europe's stagnant economic environment.
The other aspect of the Nokia trap is that Denmark might become complacent, equating Novo's success with the success of its economy as a whole. But partly because they have Finland's experience to learn from, Danish policymakers are carefully monitoring the economy for signs of underlying weaknesses that might get masked by the ""Novo effect."" The country's national statistical agency recently published GDP figures with and without the contribution of the pharmaceutical industry, and the economic ministry referenced the company 31 times in its recent economic report.
If dealt with carefully, Denmark's problem can be a good one to have. Novo Nordisk's astounding success is great for the Danish economy, of course, but only if policymakers understand the risks that come with having too much of a good thing. For now, it seems like they do."
3584,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-04-29,"The jump in measles cases in 2023 is 'very concerning' says WHO official
Over the past 20 years, there's been a lot of progress when it comes to combating measles.
But the World Health Organization's latest global numbers, released this past weekend, are ""very concerning,"" says Dr. Patrick O'Connor, the WHO's medical officer for measles and rubella.
Measles cases increased worldwide from more than 170,000 cases in 2022 to more than 320,000 cases in 2023, according to WHO's count. And the first several months of 2024 have seen nearly 100,000 measles cases. These numbers are based on actual cases reported by individual countries but experts estimate the number of measles cases globally is far higher — the estimate in 2022 was more than 9 million — since many mild cases are never reported.
What's more, the number of countries with large, disruptive outbreaks has tripled in the last few years, from 16 countries in mid-2000 to 51 countries in late 2022. Those countries are concentrated in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, says O'Connor. He attributes much of this trend to the COVID pandemic.
""We're having the perfect storm of recovered surveillance systems — so we can actually detect and find all those measles cases — [and] low immunization coverage because of the disruptions of health care,"" he says, adding that during the pandemic there were very few measles cases because of lockdowns and masks meaning there is less natural immunity now.
Even experts who saw it coming say the measles increase is ""staggering.""
That's the word used by John Vertefeuille, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Global Immunization Division.
The worrying uptick in measles outbreaks and deaths is, ""unfortunately, not unexpected given the declining vaccination rates we've seen in the past few years,"" noted Vertefeuille in a statement earlier this year. ""Urgent, targeted efforts are critical to prevent measles disease and deaths.""
Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and also one of the most preventable: two doses of vaccine in childhood is 97% protective. WHO estimates that some 61 million doses were missed or delayed in 2021. In 2022, about 83% of the world's children received one dose of measles vaccine by their first birthday – the lowest proportion since 2008, when the rate was also 83%.
""We're going to see outbreaks any time we have an accumulation of people who haven't been vaccinated,"" says Cyndi Hatcher, unit lead for measles elimination in the African Region at the CDC. ""When you have immunization disruptions, measles is always going to be one of the first epidemics that you see.""
Low-income countries continue to have the lowest vaccination rates – five sub-Saharan African countries have rates below 50% for the first dose.
""Measles is called the inequity virus for good reason. It is the disease that will find and attack those who aren't protected
In Ethiopia, for example, conflict and weaknesses in the rural health system have taken a toll on vaccination rates, says Dr. Ngozi Kennedy, UNICEF's Ethiopia health manager.
""We have a lot of pastoral communities that are often on the move so they may not know how to, or may not be able to, get to health centers for the vaccine. Also, as a result of the protracted conflicts, services are often disrupted with populations and even some health-care workers being displaced,"" she says.
Children who don't get their vaccines on schedule are at risk of death and serious illness, particularly children under age 5, who are at highest risk for severe complications including pneumonia, encephalitis (brain swelling) and death. Measles can also put children at higher risk for other potentially fatal childhood diseases – such as diarrheal diseases and meningitis – because the virus can cause the immune system to forget its learned defenses against other pathogens.
""I think that people may have forgotten how dangerous measles can be if they haven't seen cases before,"" Hatcher says.
But global health experts didn't forget, and many predicted that outbreaks would be coming.
""During the pandemic, when everything was locked down, there wasn't much measles being spread ... because no one was going anywhere,"" says WHO measles and rubella senior technical adviser Dr. Natasha Crowcroft. ""It's the usual human thing that no one does anything until the problem starts. It's really hard to sell prevention.""
Last year a coalition including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, launched ""The Big Catch-Up"" – an effort to get vaccination rates back up to at least their pre-pandemic levels. (Editor's note: The Gates Foundation is one of the funders of NPR and this blog.)
Kennedy says efforts continue in Ethiopia to shore up vaccination rates. Health workers there have begun to track childhood immunizations electronically in hopes of keeping more children current, and the country has prioritized 14 ""equity zones"" to catch kids up on their shots.
But the CDC's Cyndi Hatcher says much more needs to be done.
""I think we need to be very honest with ourselves at the global level,"" she says. ""Are we truly committed to making [measles] a public health priority and do we have the resources that we need to make full immunization a reality at the global level, the regional level but especially at the country and community level?""

3439,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-06-23,"Carrying rainbow flags and dancing through the streets, thousands of Hungarians celebrated the annual Budapest Pride parade on Saturday (22 June) and vowed to keep protesting over the government's anti-LGBTQ+ policies.
Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, in power since 2010, promotes a Christian-conservative agenda and in 2021 banned the ""promotion of homosexuality"" among under-18s despite strong criticism from rights groups and the European Union.
""It's very important to be here ... to show we exist and that we matter,"" said 30-year-old Anna Reti, who took part in the march in the capital, adding that many LGBTQ+ Hungarians face discrimination and hostility in everyday life.
""For example, I went out in the street the other day with some rainbow accessories and people stared,"" she said.
Gay marriage is not recognised in Hungary and only heterosexual couples can legally adopt children. Orbán's government has redefined marriage as the union between one man and one woman in the constitution, and limited gay adoption.
His government has said the 2021 law is meant to protect children and does not target the LGBTQ+ community, but it has caused anxiety among gay, bisexual and transgender Hungarians.
Last year, some booksellers were fined for selling books depicting homosexuality, which were not wrapped in plastic as required by the legislation.
And in November, a museum director was sacked after the institution allowed under-18s to visit a World Press Photo exhibition featuring LGBTQ+ content.
Ahead of Saturday's march, the embassies of the United States, Germany and 33 other countries urged Hungary to protect LGBTQ+ rights and scrap laws that discriminate against members of the community.
US Ambassador David Pressman was one of several diplomats to join the Pride event.
""This is an amazing country with a rich history of people standing up and fighting for freedom,"" he told reporters. ""The people here who are marching today are doing so in the best traditions of the country."""
3793,fake,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-09-16,"Known as Replican, this new ""self-amplifying"" RNA injection makes copies of itself in perpetuity before producing proteins that scientists claim will cause the human body to produce antibodies to disease.
Different from the spike protein-based mRNA (modRNA) ""vaccines"" unleashed through Operation Warp Speed, Replicon is able to self-replicate itself without altering cell DNA, though it can still result in reverse transcription and DNA alteration.
""The current COVID-19 mRNA injections don't officially have the ability to self replicate (unless they get integrated into a person's DNA),"" explains Dr. Daniel Nagase, M.D., on his ""Logical Surprises"" Substack.
""If the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA is reverse transcribed and alters a cell's DNA, only then does it attain the ability to replicate through cell division. (Every time a gene altered cell divides, it makes a copy of the Pfizer or Moderna gene(s).""
Check out the following video from Dr. Nagase in which he explains further how mRNA injections cause serious genetic damage:
(Related: We we warned, this self-replicating RNA abomination is about to go live.)
Only over the past couple of days did Dr. Nagase finally come to realize just how profoundly dangerous Replicon truly is. Based on naturally occurring alphaviruses, Replicon has the capacity to forever change the human genome of not just people who receive it directly, but also others who get ""shed"" on by someone who got jabbed.
""While I knew that a self replicating vaccine was dangerous, I initially thought that if people had pre-existing antibodies to naturally occurring [sic] Alphaviruses (that the self replicating vaccine is based upon), healthy people might be able to carry enough Alphavirus antibodies to neutralize any self replicating RNA shed from people who took the Replicon or other self amplifying RNA 'vaccines,'"" Dr. Nagase writes.
""Obtaining natural alphavirus antibodies would be most easily done by frequent natural exposures to mosquito bites. However, my thoughts about natural ways to protect against the Replicon 'vaccines' only looked at a part of the problem. There was another much greater danger that only occurred to me in the past couple days.""
The fact that Replicon and the technology behind it was hatched in 2020 right around the time when the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) ""pandemic"" was unleashed speaks volumes about what the globalist plan for humanity might really be.
Dr. Nagase is concerned about the ""environmental hardiness"" of the alphaviruses used in the vaccine lends to the possibility that deadly new outbreaks will occur that can cross between species. He warns that once unleashed, these deadly abominations could result in the entire global ecosystem of life becoming permanently altered by ""artificial genes.""
The scientists involved in developing self-replicating RNA technology have continually over the years ignored all warning signs that the end result could be a mass extinction event of unfathomable proportions. It is almost as if this was the plan all along.
The recombination potential alone of the many alphaviruses used in the technology suggest that the final solution is to destroy all life by chemically and genetically altering the entire planet.
""Because alphaviruses in the wild cross species into other animals and mosquitoes, any human who gets a Replicon injection can transmit Replicon genes not just to other people, they can transfer Replicon genetic material to other species,"" Dr. Nagase warns.
""This can happen either through a mosquito, or through recombination when a Replicon patient gets an infection with another species like coronavirus, influenza virus or other alphavirus species. Every instance when someone infected with a Replicon gets another virus while that Replicon is still in the body, presents the Replicon an opportunity to exit the patient and infect another person or animal using that other virus.""

3015,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-06-25,"While this type of melting has been previously studied, models used by the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to project the impact of global warming on the Antarctic have yet to factor in this phenomenon.
They have also systematically underestimated ice loss seen thus far, said the study, published in the journal Nature Geoscience.
As ocean temperatures rise due to human-caused global warming, Antarctic ice sheets are melting, threatening a rise in global sea levels and putting coastal communities at risk.
""Increases in ocean temperature can lead to a tipping point being passed, beyond which ocean water intrudes in an unbounded manner beneath the ice sheet, via a process of runaway melting,"" the study said.
Antarctic ice sheets sit atop the bedrock and extend beyond the coast to float on the sea.
Previous studies have shown that warm seawater is seeping into the ""grounding zone"" -- where land and ice meet -- and further inland from under the floating ice.
As the water warms, even by a fraction, the intrusion accelerates from short distances of 100 metres (330 feet) to tens of kilometres (miles), melting ice along the way by heating it from below, explained the study's lead author Alexander Bradley.
""Every 10th of a degree (of warming) makes these kind of processes closer, these tipping points closer,"" said Bradley, a researcher with the British Antarctic Survey.
The risk to sea-level rise comes when the accelerated melting outpaces the formation of new ice on the continent.
Some areas of Antarctica are more vulnerable to this process than others due to the shape of the land mass, which has valleys and cavities where sea water can pool beneath the ice.
The Pine Island glacier, currently Antarctica's largest contributor to sea-level rise, is at high risk of melting due to the slope of the land that allows in more sea water, the study said.
Scientific models need to be updated to take into account the element of melt to better predict the risk of sea-level rise in the future and prepare for it, Bradley said.
""And it really just stresses the need for urgent climate action in order to prevent these tipping points from being passed,"" he added.

5506,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-09-14,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pledged to deepen ties with Russia as he held talks with visiting security chief Sergei Shoigu, state media reported on September 14. Western powers have accused cash-strapped North Korea of selling ammunition to Russia in defiance of sanctions over the more than 30-month war in Ukraine. North Korea has recently bolstered military ties with Russia, with President Vladimir Putin making a rare visit to Pyongyang in June, where he signed a mutual defense agreement with Kim. Kim ""affirmed that his government would further expand cooperation and collaboration"" with Russia based on the agreement."
5192,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-09-26,"As the climate warms, the southwestern U.S. is increasingly experiencing weather whiplash as the region swings from drought to flooding and back again. As a result, the public is hearing more about little-known infectious diseases, such as valley fever.
In May 2024, about 20,000 people attended a music festival in Buena Vista Lake, California. In the months that followed, at least 19 developed valley fever, and eight were hospitalized from their infection. This outbreak follows a dramatic increase of more than 800% in valley fever infections in California between 2000 and 2018.
In 2023, California reported the second-highest number of valley fever cases on record, with more than 9,000 cases reported statewide. And between April 2023 and March 2024, California provisionally reported 10,593 cases – 40% more than during the same period the prior year.
The Conversation U.S. asked Jennifer Head, Simon Camponuri and Alexandra Heaney – researchers specializing in the epidemiology of valley fever – to explain what valley fever is, and what might explain its rise in recent years.
What is valley fever, and how do you get infected?
Valley fever is the common name for a disease called coccidioidomycosis, which is an infection caused by pathogenic fungi from the Coccidioides genus. The fungi are primarily found in arid soils of the southwestern United States, as well as parts of Central and South America.
When the fungus has access to moisture and nutrients, it grows long, branching fungal chains throughout the soil. When the soil dries out, these chains fragment to form fungal spores, which can be stirred up into the air when the soil is disturbed, such as by wind or digging. Airborne spores can then be inhaled and cause a respiratory infection.
Cases of valley fever are typically highest in California’s southern San Joaquin Valley and southern Arizona, but they have been increasing outside of these regions. Between 2000 and 2018, the incidence of valley fever cases increased fifteenfold in the northern San Joaquin Valley and eightfold along the Southern California coast. And between 2014 and 2018, incidence increased by more than eightfold along the central coast.
Because of these trends and the virulence of the pathogen that causes valley fever, it is listed as a priority pathogen by the World Health Organization. Historically, fungal infections have received very little attention and resources. By creating this list, the WHO is hoping to galvanize action surrounding listed pathogens, including getting more resources for research as well as the development of new treatments.
What are the symptoms, and what should people be looking for?
After inhaling fungal spores from the environment, Coccidioides initially infects the lungs, causing symptoms like mild to severe cough, fever, difficulty breathing, chest pain and tiredness. Valley fever symptoms can resemble other common respiratory infections, so it’s important for people to get checked by a doctor if they’ve experienced prolonged symptoms, particularly if they have been given antibiotics that they are not responding to.
In California and Arizona, an estimated one-third of community-acquired pneumonia cases – or pneumonia acquired outside of the hospital – are caused by valley fever. However, only a fraction of community-acquired pneumonia cases get tested for it, so it’s likely the number of valley fever cases is significantly higher. Among diagnosed cases, half experienced symptoms for two months or more before being diagnosed.
In 5% to 10% of cases, the fungus can spread from the lungs to other parts of the body, such as the central nervous system, liver and bones, causing meningitis or arthritis-like symptoms. These cases can be severe and possibly fatal.
Antifungal treatment is available, and early diagnosis and treatment is critical for better outcomes.
What time of year should you be most concerned?
Valley fever cases can occur year-round, but in California, cases reported via surveillance systems tend to increase starting in August and September, peak in November and return to background levels in January and February.
Researchers believe that patients are likely exposed to the fungus in the summer and early fall months, typically one to three months prior to their diagnosis. This delay accounts for time between when patients are exposed, develop symptoms and are diagnosed with the disease. While cases peak in the fall on average, seasonal strength and timing varies regionally.
Our research shows that this seasonal surge in the fall is especially strong following wetter winters and that alternation between dry and wet conditions is associated with increased incidence in fall months.
Valley fever cases in California nearly doubled following wet winters that occurred one and two years after the 2007-2009 and 2012-2015 droughts.
In 2023, California experienced a similar transition, with an extreme drought occurring between 2020-2022 followed by heavy precipitation in the winter of 2022-2023.
This transition was followed by a near-record spike in cases in 2023. The state experienced another wet winter during the 2023-2024 wet season, furthering concern about continued high risk for valley fever in 2024.
Our research team recently developed a model to forecast valley fever cases that will occur between April 2024 and March 2025 in California. We forecast that the state is likely to see another spike in cases during the fall and winter of 2024, on par with the spike in 2023.
During high-risk periods, clinicians should consider valley fever as a potential diagnosis. This is especially true when evaluating a patient presenting with valley fever symptoms or a respiratory illness who lives in, works in or traveled to an endemic or emerging region.
We are currently working to characterize seasonal disease patterns in Arizona as well, which are different from California’s. This is likely because Arizona has two rainy seasons.
Are some people at greater risk than others?
Those who spend time or work outdoors in areas where valley fever is common, especially where they may be exposed to dirt and dust, are more likely to get it.
While healthy people are still at risk of infection, certain factors can increase the likelihood of developing severe disease from valley fever. These include being an adult 60 years or older, having diabetes, HIV or another condition that weakens the immune system, or being pregnant. People who are Black or Filipino also have been noted to have a higher risk of severe disease, which may relate to more exposure to the fungal spores, underlying health conditions, inequities in accessing care or other possible predispositions.
How can you protect yourself from getting valley fever?
People who live and work in the regions where the fungus is found should avoid exposure to dust as much as possible. When it is windy outside and the air is dusty, stay indoors and keep windows and doors closed.
When driving through a dusty area, limit vehicle speed, keep car windows closed and recirculate the air, if possible. When working outdoors, use dust suppression techniques, including wetting soil before digging to prevent stirring up dust, and installing fencing, windbreaks and vegetation where possible.
For those who must directly stir up soil or be in dusty conditions, such as while doing construction or gardening work, consider using an N95 mask to limit dust inhalation."

On January 31, 2024, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen informed leading European Union officials that the regime of President Joe Biden is still “firmly committed” to looking for additional budgetary support for Ukraine.
Yellen made these remarks despite the large degree of gridlock present in Congress that is preventing the easy passage of this aid legislation in the US.
“Failure to act would hand a victory to (Russian President Vladimir Putin) and have unthinkable consequences not only for Ukraine, but also for our collective security,” Yellen declared.
She spoke at the beginning of a Washington meeting with EU executive vice presidents Margrethe Vestager and Valdis Dombrovskis. Yellen added that Congress must hammer out a deal as soon as possible.
“We cannot allow Ukraine to run out of money while it continues its valiant struggle to defend its democracy,” she stated.
The aid package in question also features aid to Taiwan and Israel, and substantial border security aid.
On January 31, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer declared on the Senate floor: “The survival of Ukraine is on the line.”
EU leaders such Vestager and Dombrovskis emphasized the need for a strong transatlantic strategy to maintain pressure on Russia.
“We must stay the course, we must keep pressure on Russia,” Dombrovskis highlighted. For them, this also means slapping and enforcing sanctions on Russia.
At the start of their meeting with Yellen, Yestager said “we’re in it for the long haul,” and highlighted the importance of attempts to supply 50 billion euros ($54 billion) in budget aid to Ukraine over the years to come
For the time being, EU aid has halted due to similar gridlock conditions. In this instance, Hungary has blocked the EU’s military venture. Of all the EU and NATO member states, Hungary has been a thorn in the EU’s side due to its realist foreign policy where it wants to maintain relatively cordial relations with Russia.
Hopefully, this foreign policy realism holds strong on both sides of the Atlantic. The Ukraine project is clearly an elite endeavor that advances no pressing interest for Middle Americans.

3683,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-02-01,"Two Russian courts have meted out the first convictions in connection with what the government calls the “international LGBT social movement” and which was designated as extremist last year.
On Thursday, a court in the southern region of Volgograd found a man guilty of “displaying the symbols of an extremist organization” after he posted a photograph of an LGBTQ flag online, according to the court’s press service.
Artyom P., who was ordered to pay a fine of 1,000 rubles, admitted guilt and repented, saying he had posted the image “out of stupidity,” the court said.
On Monday, a court in Nizhny Novgorod, east of Moscow, sentenced to five days in administrative detention a woman who had been in a cafe when a man approached her and demanded she remove her frog-shaped earrings displaying an image of a rainbow, said Aegis, an LGBTQ rights group.
The woman was called to the police station after the man, who filmed the encounter, posted it online.
A trial is set to resume next week in Saratov in southwestern Russian against a photographer who posted images of rainbow flags on Instagram, independent Russian news outlet Mediazona reported.
The rainbow flag represents the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community. Russian law prohibits anyone in the country “displaying the symbols” of organizations it considers extremist, a list that includes social network Meta.
Russia’s Supreme Court banned the “LGBT movement” last November, continuing a pattern of increasing restrictions in Russia on expressions of sexual orientation and gender identity.
A law passed last July outlawed legal or medical changes of gender for transgender Russians, and a law banning the promotion of “nontraditional” sexual relations has been on the books for over a decade."
5223,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-08-15,"On Aug. 14, 2024, the World Health Organization declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern. There have been over 15,600 cases and over 530 deaths reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighboring countries in Africa. The disease had previously caused a global outbreak from 2022 to 2023.
Mpox – previously called monkeypox – isn’t a new disease. The first confirmed human case was in 1970, when the virus was isolated from a child suspected of having smallpox in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Though usually mild, mpox can still potentially cause severe illness. Health officials are concerned that more cases will arise with increased travel.
I’m a researcher who has worked in public health and medical laboratories for over three decades, especially in the realm of diseases with animal origins. What exactly is happening in the current outbreak, and what does history tell us about mpox?
A cousin of smallpox
Mpox is caused by the monkeypox virus, which belongs to a subset of the Poxviridae family of viruses called Orthopoxvirus. This subset includes the smallpox, vaccinia and cowpox viruses. While an animal reservoir for monkeypox virus is unknown, African rodents are suspected to play a part in transmission. The monkeypox virus has only been isolated twice from an animal in nature. Diagnostic testing for mpox is currently only available at Laboratory Response Network labs in the U.S. and globally.
The name “monkeypox” comes from the first documented cases of the illness in animals in 1958, when two outbreaks occurred in monkeys kept for research. However, the virus did not jump from monkeys to humans, nor are monkeys major carriers of the disease.
Epidemiology
Since the first reported human case, mpox has been found in several other central and western African countries, with the majority of infections in the DRC. Cases outside of Africa have been linked to international travel or imported animals, including in the U.S. and elsewhere.
The first reported cases of mpox in the U.S. was in 2003, from an outbreak in Texas linked to a shipment of animals from Ghana. There were also travel-associated cases in July and November 2021 in Maryland. The outbreak of mpox that began May 2022 is ongoing.
Because mpox is closely related to smallpox, the smallpox vaccine can provide protection against infection from both viruses. Since smallpox was officially eradicated, however, routine smallpox vaccinations for the U.S. general population were stopped in 1972. Because of this, mpox has been appearing increasingly in unvaccinated people.
Transmission
The virus can be transmitted through contact with an infected person or animal or contaminated surfaces. Typically, the virus enters the body through broken skin, inhalation or the mucous membranes in the eyes, nose or mouth. Researchers believe that human-to-human transmission is mostly through inhalation of large respiratory droplets rather than direct contact with bodily fluids or indirect contact through clothes.
Health officials are worried that the virus may currently be spreading undetected through community transmission, possibly through a new mechanism or route. Where and how infections are occurring are still under investigation.
Signs and symptoms
After the virus enters the body, it starts to replicate and spread through the body via the bloodstream. Symptoms usually don’t appear until one to two weeks after infection.
Mpox produces smallpox-like skin lesions, but symptoms are usually milder than those of smallpox. Flu-like symptoms are common initially, ranging from fever and headache to shortness of breath. One to 10 days later, a rash can appear on the extremities, head or torso that eventually turns into blisters filled with pus. Overall, symptoms usually last two to four weeks, while skin lesions usually scab over in 14 to 21 days.
While mpox is rare and usually nonfatal, one version of the disease kills around 10% of infected people. The form of the virus currently circulating is thought to be milder, with a fatality rate of less than 1%.
Vaccines and treatments
Treatment for mpox is primarily focused on relieving symptoms. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, no treatments are available to cure mpox infection.
Evidence suggests that the smallpox vaccine can help prevent mpox infections and decrease the severity of the symptoms. One vaccine known as Imvamune or Imvanex is licensed in the U.S. to prevent mpox and smallpox.
Vaccination after exposure to the virus may also help decrease chances of severe illness. The CDC currently recommends smallpox vaccination only in people who have been or are likely to be exposed to mpox. Immunocompromised people are at high risk.

SAMASTIPUR, India (AP) — Millions of Indians across 96 constituencies began casting their ballots on Monday as the country’s gigantic, six-week-long election edges past its halfway mark. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking a third straight term with an eye on winning a supermajority in Parliament.
Monday’s polling in the fourth round of multi-phase national elections across nine states and one union territory will be pivotal for Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, as it includes some of its strongholds in states like Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.
Over 50 countries go to the polls in 2024

Crucial seats in Maharashtra and Bihar states, where the BJP governs in alliances with regional parties, are also up for grabs in this phase.
In Bihar’s Samastipur city, hundreds of voters lined up at a polling station that opened at 7 a.m. amid tight security arrangements. Voters said they were concerned about rising food prices, lack of employment and economic development in the state.
Most polls predict a win for Modi and his BJP, which is up against a broad opposition alliance led by the Indian National Congress and powerful regional parties.
The staggered election will run until June 1 and nearly 970 million voters, more than 10% of the world’s population, will elect 543 members to the lower house of Parliament for five years. The votes are scheduled to be counted on June 4.
Monday will also see the end of polling in the country’s five southern states, a region that has mostly rejected Modi’s BJP since it first came to power in 2014 but where winning more seats is crucial for the party’s campaign goal of securing a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
Kashmir’s largest city, Srinagar, will also vote Monday in the first polls since Modi’s government stripped the disputed region of its semi-autonomy and took direct control of it in 2019. Despite hailing the move as a success that would bring economic development and peace to the restive region, the BJP is not contesting the polls in the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley, where anti-India sentiment runs deep, for the first time since 1996.
Instead, two regional parties — the National Conference and the People’s Democratic Party — are the main contenders for the three seats in the valley and both are opposed to the BJP.
Opposition parties say the BJP’s decision not to contest the election is in contrast to its claims and that poll results may contradict the government’s narrative of success in Kashmir, which is now run by unelected government officials and bureaucrats.
Waheed-Ur-Rehman Para, a leader of the People’s Democratic Party who is seeking to represent Srinagar, said the election there was about “a referendum against the government’s decisions and policies that were implemented without any public consent.”
While Modi began his campaign with a focus on India’s development in his 10 years in power, he has since doubled down on the BJP’s Hindu nationalism pitch in recent weeks.
In campaign rallies, Modi has called Muslims “infiltrators” and accused the main opposition Congress Party of scheming to redistribute wealth from the country’s Hindus to Muslims, who comprise 14% of the country’s more than 1.4 billion people.
Nikhilesh Mishra, a 42-year-old bank employee in Samastipur, said: “Raking up issues of Hindus versus Muslims will take us nowhere.”
He said Modi’s BJP-led alliance in Bihar, which secured an overwhelming majority in the 2019 election, had failed to bring development to the state, which is among the poorest in India.
Mishra said rising inflation and unemployment are driving young people to migrate to other states, draining it of its talent. “We want development. ... This time, we want change in the government,” he said.
Meanwhile, Modi appeared confident of BJP’s chances in Bihar, telling the New Delhi Television channel on Sunday that his alliance will fare better than it did in the 2019 elections, when it lost one seat.
“We may not even lose one this time,” he said.
Some analysts say the change in tone comes as the BJP hopes to consolidate votes among the majority Hindu population, who make up 80% of voters, and to distract voters from larger issues, like unemployment, corruption and inflation.
Despite India being one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, many people continue to face economic distress, which has been a key focus in the opposition’s campaign.

3616,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-10-02,"The number of people out of work due to ill health is growing by 300,000 a year, according to fresh analysis by a leading health thinktank.
People of working age who quit their job due to ill health were also three times less likely to return to employment than those in good health, adding to the number of people claiming disability benefits, the Health Foundation said.
Official data has dashed hopes that the effects of the pandemic would fade and the labour market would return to the situation seen before the pandemic.
The foundation said that, in addition to 4 million working-age people out of work with ill health, there were now 3.9 million people with work-limiting health conditions in employment – an increase of 1.5 million since 2013.
Indicating that the UK has seen a significant increase in the number of working-age people with disabilities that affect how they do their job, the foundation’s report showed that these workers were three times more likely to leave the workforce than those in good health.
While unemployment has increased only slightly since the onset of high inflation and the cost of living crisis in 2021, the number of people suffering mental and physical health issues has soared.
Reports from the Bank of England have highlighted how a lack of workers in key industries has forced employers to pay higher wages, preventing prices from stabilising and having knock-on effects on the economy.
Bank officials kept interest rates at 5% at their last meeting, saying they wanted to see more data indicating a return to previous levels of participation in the labour market, easing price pressures, before they cut the cost of borrowing.
The foundation said the report’s findings were part of an interim study by the Commission for Healthier Working Lives, to examine the growing challenges of working-age ill health.
Drawing on insights from employers, experts and the public, the report argues that the government needs to adopt new measures to support people with health conditions and help them back to work when possible.
The report said that support for workers with health conditions “often comes too late or is absent”.
It said: “Fewer than half of UK workers have access to occupational health services, the fit note system is ineffective and statutory sick pay is less generous than in other countries.”
“While many employers want to help, they often lack the capacity or knowledge, especially smaller businesses,” it said.
Sacha Romanovitch, chair of the Commission for Healthier Working Lives, said ministers needed to develop a strategy that supports a healthier workforce.
In the run-up to this month’s budget, and an employment white paper expected in the autumn, Romanovitch said the government needed to clear the backlog of “Access to Work” claims “so that people with disabilities and health conditions receive the support they are entitled to without delay”.
She added that there also needed to be a review of working practices in the public sector where rates of work-related ill health have soared.
“The evidence in this report shows that, despite common misconceptions, many people with long-term health conditions are eager to work and can contribute meaningfully to the economy, yet often lack the support and flexibility they need,” she said."
5779,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-09-25,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on September 25 of taking billions of dollars from the United States while at the same time refusing to ""make a deal"" to end Russia’s full-scale invasion.
RFE/RL's Ukraine Live Briefing gives you the latest developments on Russia's invasion, Western military aid, the plight of civilians, and territorial control maps. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.
Trump, who has been highly critical of the aid Washington has disbursed to Kyiv, said Ukraine should have made concessions to Russian President Vladimir Putin in the months before Russia's February 2022 attack.
""Any deal -- the worst deal -- would’ve been better than what we have now,"" Trump said. ""If they made a bad deal, it would’ve been much better. They would’ve given up a little bit and everybody would be living, and every building would be built, and every tower would be aging for another 2,000 years.”
Trump made the remark at a campaign rally in North Carolina as Zelenskiy attended the UN General Assembly in New York ahead of a visit on September 26 to Washington, where U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to announce an additional aid package.
Trump has frequently claimed that Russia never would have invaded Ukraine if he had been U.S. president and that he would swiftly put an end to the war if he returned to the White House. But he has not presented any concrete explanation of how he would accomplish that.
In a debate earlier this month with Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump refused to say whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war.
Russia and Ukraine held several negotiations before the full-scale invasion was launched in February 2022, but Kyiv rejected the demands put forth by Moscow, which included recognizing Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and separatist-controlled entities in Luhansk and Donetsk.
Trump’s comments in North Carolina appeared to be in response to Zelenskiy’s comments in an interview with The New Yorker in which he said Trump “doesn’t really know how to stop the war even if he might think he knows how.”
Trump noted that Zelenskiy was in the United States and said he was making “little nasty aspersions toward your favorite president, me.""
He also described Ukraine as a country in ruins outside of Kyiv that is short on soldiers and questioned whether it had any bargaining chips left to negotiate an end to the war.
“What deal can we make? It’s demolished,” he added. “The people are dead. The country is in rubble.”
Zelenskiy said he would present Biden with what he calls a victory plan for the war that is expected to include a request for permission to use long-range weapons provided by the United States to strike Russian targets.
There had been reports that a face-to-face meeting between Trump and Zelenskiy would take place in New York, but the meeting was expected to be scrapped, according to U.S. media.
The White House said Biden launched a joint declaration of support for Ukraine’s recovery and reconstruction involving more than 30 countries, including the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, and the European Union.
Biden, Zelenskiy, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen gathered with other world leaders on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in a strong display of unity for Ukraine.
""We're committed to providing Ukraine with the resources that it needs to build back stronger than before.... You're not alone in this fight,"" Biden said in launching the joint declaration.
A copy of the document distributed by the White House said it was Russia's responsibility under international law to pay for damages it had caused in Ukraine.
""We reaffirm that, consistent with all applicable laws and our respective legal systems, Russia’s sovereign assets in our jurisdictions will remain immobilized until Russia ends its aggression and pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine,"" it said.
Biden said more U.S. actions to accelerate support for Ukraine will be announced on September 26.
In his remarks, Zelenskiy mentioned the U.S. Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe after World War II and said: ""Today we are laying the foundation for a similar architecture of recovery.""
Meanwhile, the U.S State Department announced on September 25 that Washington will provide $375 million in additional military aid to Ukraine.
The package includes high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS) and mine-resistant ambush protected (MRAP) vehicles, as well as Javelin and tube-launched, optically-tracked, wire-guided (TOW) missiles."

The court in the southern city of Crotone found Gun Ufuk, a 29-year-old Turkish national, guilty of crimes including causing a shipwreck and aiding illegal immigration. It also ordered him to pay a €3m fine and pay damages to civil plaintiffs.
Ufuk, who denied being in charge of the boat, was one of four alleged human smugglers on a migrant vessel that went down in stormy weather off the coast of Calabria on 26 February last year.
The wooden boat, which was carrying about 180 migrants from Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan and Syria, including many children, had departed Turkey and went down metres from the shore.
It was the deadliest migrant shipwreck to occur so close to the coastline in Italy since October 2013 when 368 people died when their boat sank off the island of Lampedusa.
For days after last year’s shipwreck, bodies and debris washed up on the beaches of the area. One suspected smuggler died in the shipwreck, while two others are facing trial.
Ufuk told the court on Wednesday that he was hired to be the boat’s mechanic but was never at the helm.
“I had to flee Turkey for political reasons,” he told the court, explaining how he had been jailed for criticising President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
After the shipwreck, the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, pledged to crack down on human smugglers, including handing out tougher sentences and giving preferential quotas to workers from countries who help fight smugglers.
Her far-right Brothers of Italy party won elections in 2022 on a promise to curb the arrivals of migrants by sea.
The country arrested about 250 boat drivers in 2023, according to a report published by NGOs last month, with the majority Egyptian nationals piloting vessels carrying migrants from Libya or Tunisia.

5941,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-02-09,"The European Commission has invited interested companies to help ""to facilitate and speed up the development, demonstration, and deployment"" of small modular nuclear reactors, a fledgling technology it hopes will help the EU achieve its goal of reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.
The EU executive is inviting applicants to a European Industrial Alliance with a view to seeing Europe’s first small modular reactors (SMR) integrated into power grids or district heating systems early in the next decade, in line with its plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 90% below 1990 levels over the next 16 years.
“They can contribute on our decarbonisation pathway to complement renewables, and provide baseload energy production for deep electrification, reliable source of heat for industries and urban districts, as well as for low-carbon hydrogen production,” energy commissioner Kadri Simson as she invited companies on Friday (9 February) to join the platform, announced earlier this week in a climate policy package.
The alliance is open to firms “willing to work together to facilitate and speed up the development, demonstration, and deployment” of a fledgling technology that has also been recognised in the Net Zero Industry Act agreed provisionally earlier this week, potentially easing planning processes and smoothing access to state support.
The inclusion of nuclear power in Europe’s climate mitigation policy has been divisive, with France leading a group of EU members in favour promoting it as a low-carbon solution and Germany against – a fact recognised by Simson’s stressing that it would only be rolled out “in the countries that choose to do so, in full respect of the highest standards of nuclear safety”.
Internal market commissioner Thierry Breton said SMRs would play a “central role” in Europe’s climate action. “In a context of increasing business competition on SMRs at global level, Europe is promptly responding, capitalising on its strong nuclear competence, innovation, and manufacturing capability,” he said in a statement.
Small reactors of less than 300 megawatt capacity, and as little as 10 MW, could be “considerably more flexible” – with regard to site selection, construction time and the amount of water needed to cool them – than conventional large plants, which typically consist of several units of around 1,000 MW, the Commission said.
Environmental groups have criticised the Commission’s reliance on technologies, including SMRs and carbon capture and storage, that have yet to be proved at scale for meeting EU climate targets, rather than focusing resources on promoting existing solutions such as solar and wind power.
The SMR platform is the latest of several such industry alliances set up to further Europe’s ‘green deal’ agenda, with the first designed to develop domestic battery production capacity for batteries followed by others in areas as diverse as zero-emission aviation, plastics recycling and hydrogen production."

Former Central Intelligence Agency analyst Larry Johnson recently went on an interview with Redacted News where he revealed that Ukrainian officials have compared the country to a sinking ship like the Titanic as it has become abundantly clear that Russia is winning its war against Ukraine.
“The fact that the New York Times is now reporting this tells you how bad the situation is. They’ve realized that this party is over,” Johnson told Redacted host Clayton Morris in the interview, making a reference to a NYT report.
“It goes to part of another story that came out last week about members of the Rada – the legislature. They’re trying to get out of Ukraine. So to get out of Ukraine at the border you’ve got to show a passport. So no passport, no leaving,” Johnson stated.
“The fact that the Ukrainian legislators recognize that the end is near, which is why they’re trying to get out, it’s like that scene from the movie Titanic. The passengers are moving one direction, the rats are moving the opposite way. That’s what’s going on in Ukraine right now. The rats are heading for the lifeboats.”
The following section from the New York Times report was particularly damning:
Below is a key, damning section from the fresh NY Times reporting…
Recruiters have confiscated passports, taken people from their jobs and, in at least one case, tried to send a mentally disabled person to military training, according to lawyers, activists and Ukrainian men who have been subject to coercive tactics. Videos of soldiers shoving people into cars and holding men against their will in recruiting centers are surfacing with increasing frequency on social media and in local news reports.
The harsh tactics are being aimed not just at draft dodgers but at men who would ordinarily be exempt from service — a sign of the steep challenges Ukraine’s military faces maintaining troop levels in a war with high casualties, and against a much larger enemy.
Lawyers and activists say the aggressive methods go well beyond the scope of recruiters’ authority and in some cases are illegal. They point out that recruiters, unlike law enforcement officers, are not empowered to detain civilians, let alone force them into conscription.
Anyone who believes that Ukraine has a chance of winning this conflict is simply delusional. Russia has escalatory dominance in this region and it will not stop until it has completely pummeled Ukraine into territorial disintegration. The only way to prevent this scenario is by stopping the deployment of military aid to Ukraine and encouraging diplomatic talks.

3417,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-10-07,"Severe Covid infections can drive inflammation in the brain’s “control centre”, researchers say, leading to damage that may explain the long-term breathlessness, fatigue and anxiety some patients experience.
High-resolution MRI scans of 30 people hospitalised with Covid early in the pandemic, before the introduction of vaccines, found signs of inflammation in the brainstem, a small but critical structure that governs life-sustaining bodily functions such as breathing, heart rate and blood pressure.
The scans suggest that severe Covid infections can provoke an immune reaction which inflames the brainstem, with the resulting damage producing symptoms that can last for months after patients have been discharged.
“The fact that we see abnormalities in the parts of the brain associated with breathing strongly suggests that long-lasting symptoms are an effect of inflammation in the brainstem following Covid-19 infection,” said Dr Catarina Rua, a neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge and first author on the study.
The project was launched before researchers and public health officials knew about long Covid, the chronic post-viral illness estimated to affect 2 million people in England and Scotland and tens of millions globally. But many people with long Covid report breathlessness and fatigue, raising the possibility that brain inflammation could be involved in their symptoms, too.
“We didn’t study people with long Covid, but they do often have long-lasting effects of breathlessness and fatigue, which are similar to the symptoms these very severely affected people had six months after they were hospitalised,” Rua said. “It does lead us to ask the question, do people with long Covid have any brainstem changes?”
Rua and her colleagues used powerful 7 Tesla MRI scanners to image the patients’ brains. These revealed enough detail to see inflammation and microstructural abnormalities in the brainstem tissue. All of the patients had been admitted to hospital with severe Covid near the start of the pandemic.
The scans highlighted abnormalities linked to inflammation in multiple parts of the brainstem, starting several weeks after patients were admitted to hospital. The damage was still evident in scans more than six months later.
Damage to the brainstem might also contribute to the mental health problems some patients face after Covid infection. Of the patients in the study, those with the highest levels of brainstem inflammation had the most severe physical symptoms and the highest levels of depression and anxiety, according to the study published in Brain.
“While this study does not conclusively prove the causes of long Covid, it does point a finger at one possible suspect for some of the symptoms experienced,” said Paul Mullins, a professor in neuroimaging at the University of Bangor. “It is not clear that this shows much in the way of possible treatments for long Covid once it has occurred, but it perhaps does point to the need to reduce inflammatory responses during initial Covid infection and response.”"
3653,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-09-17,"The approved bill is the latest in a string of laws seemingly taken from Moscow's playbook.
Georgia's parliament has approved draft legislation curtailing LGBTQ+ rights, a measure echoing similar laws adopted in neighbouring Russia.
The bill was voted through on Tuesday after it was originally introduced by the ruling populist party Georgian Dream earlier this year.
It includes bans on same-sex marriages, adoption by same-sex couples, gender-affirming care, public endorsement of LGBTQ+ relations and people, and depictions of them in the media.
This extends to outlawing Pride events and public displays of the rainbow flag, as well as censoring them in films and books.
Georgian Dream leaders claim the law is necessary to safeguard traditional moral standards in the country.
LGBT rights are a controversial issue in Georgia, with polls showing general disapproval of same-sex relationships and Pride marches often coming under physical attack. The country's constitution also bans same-sex marriage.
Nevertheless, President Salome Zourabichvili, a critic of Georgian Dream, has reportedly declared that she will block the bill. However, the government and its allies have enough seats in parliament to overturn her veto. The president's powers are mostly ceremonial.
In approving the law, Georgia follows in the footsteps of Russia, which the ruling government appears to be tilting back towards as October's election approaches, despite Tbilisi's aspirations to join the EU.
Russian authorities over the past decade also banned public endorsement of ""non-traditional sexual relations"" as well as gender-affirming care, among other measures.
Russia's Supreme Court effectively outlawed LGBTQ+ activism by labelling what the authorities called the LGBTQ+ ""movement"" operating in Russia as an extremist organisation and banning it.
The new initiative was announced by Georgian Dream on the heels of the country adopting another law critics denounced as borrowed from Moscow's playbook — the ""foreign agents"" law.
It ignited weeks of protests and was widely criticised as threatening democratic freedoms and jeopardising Georgia’s chances of joining the EU.
Zourabichvili vetoed the law, but her decision was overturned in parliament.
Most of Eastern Europe lags behind when it comes to LGBTQ+ rights. Bulgaria and Hungary are two other countries that have recently passed anti-LGBTQ+ ""propaganda"" laws, adding to a long list of Eastern European countries at the bottom of the rankings."
3812,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-05-02,"The CDC says maternal mortality rates in the U.S. got better, after a pandemic spike
After spiking in 2021, the maternal mortality rate in the U.S. improved significantly the following year, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The data shows that 817 women died of maternal causes in the U.S. in 2022, compared to 1,205 in 2021. These are deaths that take place during pregnancy or within 42 days following delivery, according to the World Health Organization, ""from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes.""
""I think that the bump [in 2021] reflects the pandemic and we're returning to pre-pandemic levels,"" says study author Donna Hoyert, who a health scientist at the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.
The maternal mortality rate in 2022 was 22.3 deaths per 100,000 live births. That's a significant decrease from the 2021 rate of 32.9, but it's still much higher than the rate in other wealthy countries.
There continue to be enormous racial disparities in the U.S. maternal mortality rate as well – the rate for Black women was 49.5 deaths per 100,000 births in 2022, compared to a rate of 19 deaths for white women. Research shows the vast majority of these deaths are preventable.
Dr. Veronica Gillispie-Bell is an OB-GYN in New Orleans who was not involved in the CDC report. She agrees that COVID-19 was likely the reason for the major spike in maternal mortality.
""I really think that 2021 was actually an outlier because of the circumstances,"" Gillispie-Bell says. ""We know that because of COVID-19, there were disruptions to care that obviously impacted our ability to care for pregnant individuals, plus there were pregnant individuals who were dying from COVID."" It's hard to know for certain since the CDC report did not include cause of death, she adds.
She's encouraged that the 2022 numbers are slightly lower than 2020 – 817 in 2022 versus 861 in 2020. ""It could mean that we're moving in the right direction – I think we need more years of data to know,"" she says.
CDC's newest data comes several weeks after an academic study cast doubt on the agency's methodology, suggesting that a pregnancy checkbox on death certificates was causing the numbers to be much higher than they are in reality. CDC strongly rejected the study's findings.
Hoyert also defends CDC's methodology. ""There was plenty of literature before we made the changes that we were underestimating [maternal deaths] without a checkbox, and so we did add the checkbox,"" she says, explaining that they have continued to do evaluations and issue guidance to ensure it's being used correctly.
""I think CDC is doing great work in collecting the data and sharing that back,"" CDC Director Mandy Cohen told NPR last month. ""We disagree with how that study was looking at it, and think it's unacceptable for moms to be dying at that rate here in the United States.""
The stakes for getting these numbers right are high in a post-Roe America. Reproductive health advocates warn that abortion bans threaten women's lives, and if CDC's data is not viewed as reliable by the public, that could make it hard to evaluate the impact of these restrictions.
In a statement about CDC's latest report, Dr. Verda Hicks, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, connected the maternal mortality figures to ""the worsening state of reproductive health care since the Dobbs decision.""
""When treating pregnancy complications, abortion care can be lifesaving, and withholding that care unquestionably compromises patient lives and outcomes,"" Hicks wrote.
Despite the challenges with the data, Dr. Gillispie-Bell says the public should still put a ""great bit of stock"" into CDC's analysis. She also pointed to the work of state maternal mortality review committees around the country – she is the medical director of the committee in Louisiana. They are supported and funded by CDC.
""The first step for our maternal mortality review committee – once we get the death certificate with that pregnancy checkbox – is to then start extracting data to confirm ... so our numbers are very accurate,"" she says.
Not all states have these committees validating maternal deaths and making recommendations to reduce their numbers. CDC Director Cohen pointed out the agency now has funding available for each state. She also pointed out that CDC's data has already led to policy changes to reduce maternal deaths, including allowing Medicaid coverage to continue for a year postpartum.
""I think we're making strides, which is great,"" Cohen added. ""We have more work to do."""
6092,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-10-18,"Eric Hovde didn’t say people who believe in transitioning to clean energy are smoking crack cocaine
If Your Time is short
During a Nov. 17, 2022, appearance at Sunwest Bank’s Economic Forum, Hovde said that if people think an economy can transition from its existing fuel sources ""in a matter of a decade,"" they are smoking crack cocaine.
In this remark and other similar ones, Hovde is casting doubt on the pace of the clean energy transition, not saying anyone who thinks it can happen at all is kidding themselves. That’s a key distinction.
Hovde has derided clean energy initiatives in the past, and energy experts critiqued the usefulness of his overall point here. But that doesn’t change that he didn’t say what the group claims he did.
U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde has an evolving relationship with clean energy.
The Republican businessman, who will face incumbent Democrat U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin on Nov. 5, has embraced solar energy tax credits for his Sunwest Bank clients in recent years. That’s a flip from his 2012 campaign for the Senate, during which he said he was ""wholeheartedly"" opposed to tax credits for green energy.
He listed low costs for solar power and improved solar technology, as reasons for his change of heart. He still expresses doubt, however, about tax credits for other forms of clean energy, such as electric vehicles and wind turbines.
Climate Power, a strategic communications group focused on electing politicians who care about climate change, picked up on Hovde’s stance — particularly a fiery comment he made during Sunwest Bank’s Economic Forum Nov. 17, 2022.
""Hovde claims anyone who believes in transitioning to a clean energy economy is ‘smoking crack cocaine,’"" the group wrote in an Oct. 18 email previewing Hovde and Baldwin’s debate later that night.
But that phrasing leaves out a part of his comment that significantly changes what Hovde was saying.
Let’s take a look.
Hovde was remarking on pace of U.S. energy transition
Asked for evidence to support the group’s statement, Climate Power spokesperson Christina Polizzi pointed to the YouTube recording of the Economic Forum, and the Journal Sentinel’s mention of Hovde’s ""smoking crack cocaine"" remark, and news articles where he was quoted on the same issue.
Polizzi also sent links to other comments by Hovde deriding clean energy mandates and tax credits.
But here’s Hovde’s full quote from the forum, where the remark Climate Power picked up on comes from: ""To think that we are going to move an economy the size … any economy from its existing energy sources in a matter of a decade? You are smoking crack cocaine.""
The key part Climate Power omitted is the time element — Hovde cast doubt on a quick transition to a clean energy future, not the transition itself.
That takes the group’s claim from spot-on to off-base.
In more recent interviews, Hovde has extended the timeline for a clean energy transition that he believes people are kidding themselves on.
""To think we’re going to move off gas, (natural) gas, oil, in the next 50 years — you’re living in la la land,"" he said during an Oct. 8 luncheon cosponsored by the Milwaukee Press Club and Rotary Club of Milwaukee.
And he told the Cap Times in August that the push to end fossil fuel use before the next half century is ""delusional.""
Still, his point is clear — he’s arguing the clean energy transition is unlikely to happen in the coming decade or decades, not that people are wrong to believe it will happen at all, as the Climate Power claim makes it seem.
How fast could the clean energy transition happen?
It’s Hovde’s opinion, of course, that people who believe in achieving 100% clean energy in the U.S. in the next few decades are ""living in la la land,"" ""delusional"" or ""smoking crack cocaine.""
Energy experts point out there are already several states moving toward that benchmark by way of executive order or legislation. According to the Clean Energy States Alliance, there are currently 24 states, plus Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, that have set 100% clean energy goals. That includes Minnesota, which in 2023 passed a law requiring the state’s electricity to be carbon-free by 2040, and Wisconsin, which aims to achieve the same by 2050.
Those aren’t ""pie-in-the-sky figures,"" said Chelsea Chandler, Clean Wisconsin’s climate, energy and air program director.
""All of the science points to the clean energy transition being absolutely technically feasible,"" Chandler said. ""It’s not a technical problem, it’s a political challenge.""
Although more than 100 countries have adopted pledges to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, according to the United Nations, the world is not on track to reach that goal because ""commitments made by governments to date fall far short of what is required.""
Some people say comments such as Hovde’s take away from the energy transition’s urgency.
""It’s like firefighters showing up to a burning building and saying, ‘If you think we can put this out in an hour, you’re smoking crack cocaine,’"" Clean Wisconsin communications director Amy Barrilleaux said. ""The point is to try to put out the fire as fast as possible, not sit on the sideline coming up with excuses.""
Our ruling
Climate Power claimed Hovde said anyone who believes in transitioning to a clean economy ""is smoking crack cocaine.""
What the group brushed over is that his remark was about the pace of the energy transition. In the ""smoking crack cocaine"" example in particular, it’s ""in a matter of a decade.""
Hovde has criticized clean energy initiatives in the past, and energy experts critiqued the usefulness of Hovde’s overall point. But it doesn’t change that he did not say what the group says he did.
We rate this claim False.

6181,fake,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-02-17,"One common way that liberal media outlets report on the Catholic Church is to suggest they’re declining in numbers because they haven’t fully embraced the libertine left. CBS News posted a classic in this genre on St. Valentine’s Day:
Boston's Catholic parishes see decline in membership, with some alienated by beliefs
Reporter Laura Haefeli began:
BOSTON - Boston's Catholic parishes are seeing a significant decline in membership, an alarming trend in one of the most Catholic cities in America.
""I have distinct memories of being 4, 5 years old, praying each night before going to bed, you know, what if my life was slightly different?"" said Madeline Marlett of Dignity Boston. She's a transgender woman, who was homeschooled as a child with a conservative Catholic curriculum.
""To be LGBT mean you were ill or disordered,"" said Marlett. She's still devoted to the church, leading Catholic LGBTQ+ youth at Dignity Boston.
The story cites the Catholic News Agency reporting a Gallup poll that the percentage of Catholics who are members of a church has declined 20 percent since 2000. The decline, they regularly suggest, is due to failing to modernize like Massachusetts.
What's always missing from a story like this is any notion of ""why didn't you leave?"" Why wouldn't you join a transgender-""welcoming"" church like the Episcopalians, or the Unitarians? The answer? They want to undermine the conservatives. Dignity Boston pledges to ""work for the development of its sexual theology and for the inclusion of LGBTQI persons as full and equal members of the Church."" It's a theology that says God ""created me trans.""
🏳️⚧️ We're so proud of our Young Adult Caucus co-chair Madeline Marlett's response in this Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article! We stand against trans exclusion and discrimination!— DignityUSA (@DignityUSA) May 19, 2022
📰 Read it here: https://t.co/KhHw8AmxgB pic.twitter.com/SukEf4T4Oj
CBS found a Jesuit theologian from Harvard who locates a middle ground between conservatives and progressives, and they posted a statement from the Diocese of Boston that sounds receptive to all. CBS won't quote a real dissent from a conservative who would combat the LGBT activists, because that kind of ""fairness and balance"" is considered ""hate speech."" The LGBT lobby calls for ""reform,"" and the conservatives would call for repentance, as every church member should repent of their sins. But, typically, the word ""sin"" never appears in this story.
They also found a woman who's ""the executive director of Resolve New England, a resource for families facing infertility, like she did."" She can't understand why the church can't support in vitro fertilization and surrogacy. CBS noted Pope Francis recently spoke out strongly against surrogacy.
Marlett returns for a quote to end the story, to leave the reader with the leftist message:
In the meantime, hopeful Catholics like Marlett will continue to cheer for the church she loves and wait for it to love her back.
""It does cause pain, people will continue to feel left out and excluded but in this moment now, it is our church,"" said Marlett.
Liberal journalists constantly misunderstand that the Catholic Church is not a democracy. Catholics believe the church was founded by Jesus and handed down to the Pope and the bishops in apostolic succession. Conservatives believe the scriptures and the deposit of faith -- built since Christ died and rose again -- should be upheld, not surrendered after a poll to the latest libertine sexual theology."
6170,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-10-27,"Germany's transgender rights law takes effectNovember 1, 2024
Starting Friday, people aged 18 and older will be able to change official records to alter their names and genders or have the gender marker removed altogether, under Germany's new Self-Determination Act.
There is a mandatory three-month wait between applying and making a personal declaration, but the requirement for two psychiatric assessments and a court hearing have been scrapped.
Minors — over the age of 14 — can do so with parental approval, or seek legal recourse. Parents can act on behalf of younger children, but the child needs to be present at the register office and give their assent. This is a purely bureaucratic procedure with no medical implications.
Nyke Slawik, a German parliamentarian and transgender woman who helped negotiate the bill for the Green Party, hailed the law as a historic reform of international significance. ""It's a sign of hope in times where right-wing populist voices are getting louder again and where there is unfortunately a rollback in many countries in terms of the rights of queer people,"" she told DW.
More accessible, less costly, far less intrusive
Kalle Hümpfner, policy officer for the German Trans* Association (BVT), welcomed the fact that gender self-recognition will now be much more accessible and less costly.
Hümpfner stressed that the new law will also make the process far less intrusive. ""In the assessments, people were forced to divulge a lot of very personal information — information that was shared with the court. There have been many awful reports of people having to talk about their sexual preferences, about their masturbation practices, or their underwear choices,"" Hümpfner said.
Some 1,200 people in Berlin, with its thriving LGBTQI+ community, have submitted applications to date, according to the German press agency dpa. The Catholic news agency KNA has reported a similar level of interest in other major cities.
Richard Köhler is an expert advisor for TGEU (Trans Europe and Central Asia), a nonprofit advocacy group for trans and nonbinary people. He said the move brought Germany back into line with international human rights law and European developments of the last 10 years. It is now the 12th country in Europe to introduce legal self-determination legislation.
""Let's face it, it's an issue affecting a small number of people in a very personal way and respecting their choices doesn't harm anyone else, but it does uphold the core values of dignity and freedom that we all share,"" he said. Köhler warned that many other countries in Europe are introducing bans on legal and medical transition, including in Georgia and Russia.
Making lives of a marginalized minority easier
The changes make the practical daily lives of transgender, inter-sex, and nonbinary people much easier, as there is no longer a potential mismatch between appearance and official paperwork, which can make traveling abroad prohibitive or even just paying by credit card a serious headache.
Once someone has applied to change their gender and first name, no further applications can be made for a minimum of 12 months. Right-wing populists have suggested the new law would lead to people changing their gender marker every year.
Altering a birth certificate generates a huge volume of follow-through bureaucracy in changing official documents, from driving licenses to school exam certificates. ""It's an enormous amount of work to make your documents match and no one does that just for fun,"" said Hümpfner of the German Trans* Association.
Inclusivity and gender politics have become sensitive topics in Germany. Germany's center-left government of Social Democrats (SPD), Greens and neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) took over in late 2021 with a pledge to progress and modernize the government, and included the change to the law in their coalition treaty. It was opposed by the largest opposition bloc, the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) and Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU) and also by the far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD).
The new Self-Determination law was passed in April 2024 after a hotly contested debate in which a number of restrictions were added.
'Orchestrated attack against democracy, equality, diversity'
Hümpfner expressed regret that anxiety and fear of abuse had framed the debate — with transgender people repeatedly cast in the role of potential perpetrators. ""Time and time again during the entire legislative process, it was forgotten that this is about the basic rights of a marginalized and still very disadvantaged group,"" said Hümpfner.
Changes to the draft law included appearing to give business owners the right to decide whether or not to refuse individuals access to their premises on the basis of their gender. ""There was a lot of discussion about women's saunas. Our experience is that many transwomen rarely or never go into saunas because being in these places and being stared at a lot because of their physicality is regarded as unpleasant,"" said Hümpfner.
Another concern raised during discussions surrounding the passage of the bill was about the possibility of transwomen using women's shelters. The Association of Women's Shelters (FHK) told the German newspaper Tagesspiegel this was baseless. ""We do not know of a single case from our membership of transgender women misusing a safe house or becoming violent there — and that although transwomen have been regularly using safe houses for many years and finding protection in them without great ado,"" said the FHK.
Köhler also argued that the way the debate had been steered had poisoned public discourse and polarized the population, adding that people in the trans community were experiencing a rise in antagonism and harassment as a result.
""We're seeing an orchestrated attack against democracy, against equality, against the diversity in our society. And it's deliberate and it's orchestrated and it's heavily financed,"" said Köhler. He said trans people were easy targets because they made up such a small minority and so few people had personal contact with them.
Women's fears being instrumentalized
Beate von Miquel, the chair of the National Council of German Women's Organizations (DF) and a gender researcher, told DW that the issue was being politically instrumentalized and had become part of a culture war by far-right groups not known for their advocacy of women's rights.
""It is really bitter for the women's movement that this has become a very divisive issue. We should not allow ourselves to be divided,"" she said.
Von Miquel, whose umbrella organization represents 60 women's associations and groups, warned that the trans community and women's organizations should not be played off against one another.
""There is concern that the category woman or women will disappear and that it won't be about women anymore,"" said Miquel. ""We will stay the German Women's Council. But there must be more freedom and diversity and individuality, there is more than one way of living gender and being a woman.""

3605,fake,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-03-15,"I have to shake my head in sadness at the depravity of some doctors in the US. A recent news article mentioned that top pro-LGBT doctors know transgender hormones cause cancer and death (as well as several other problems) and yet still continue to prescribe them.
Not only that, but they refer minors for surgery, even after learning that they have a mental health disorder. One callous doctor, Christine McGinn, is quoted saying she: “operated on three DID [Dissociative Identity Disorder] patients” and also is upset over hospitals that are starting to ban transgender surgeries for minors, blaming the hospitals and surgeons for not doing the surgeries because of political pressure.
This article, citing leaked office memos and video meetings from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), has plenty of condemning material. This group is touted as the global leader in gender “medicine” (really mutilation and harmful hormone pushing).
Their own internal communications show that most doctors did know about some of the effects of hormones and unnecessary surgeries, and many are unconcerned with them. One doctor even blamed the victims (and their parents), saying, “Patients need to own and take active responsibility for medical decisions, especially those that have potentially permanent effects.”
But not only do they know this, many pages of the leaked document show that they also know minors (especially younger ones), cannot adequately give informed consent when they do not understand what will be done to them. One doctor is quoted as saying, “We try to talk about it, but most of the kids are nowhere in any kind of a brain space to really, really, really talk about it seriously.”
Another doctor admitted repeatedly that most doctors know that many children and their parents don’t understand the effects that puberty blockers, hormones, and surgeries will have on their bodies. Even people with mental health issues such as major depressive disorder, complex post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression due to homelessness, have been waved through the transgender mutilation mill.
Yet these doctors continue to perform and push for so-called gender medicine. Why would they do that? Some are perhaps in it for the money, as trans-surgeries are expensive and require follow-up visits for years. But ultimately, it is because they do not have an ultimate standard for morality.
Like it is said in Judges 17:6 and 21:25, “In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.” They worship the god of “self,” not the one true God of Scripture.
But another reason I am saddened by this news article is for the hardness of these doctors’ hearts deceived by sin (Hebrews 3:13) and because of what Christ said of those who would harm little ones precious to him (Luke 17:1–3). We should all pray that this leaked memo causes people to wake up, repent, and turn to Christ as the Savior for sin!
It also should remind us who is ultimately behind this: “You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies” (John 8:44).
The devil takes everything God has created/ordained and perverts it. He hates that which is made in the image of God."
5759,fake,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-08-29,"Ukraine used aerial drones on Aug. 22 to attack an air base in Russia's Volgograd region as part of its campaign of long-range strikes aimed at bringing down Moscow's war machine. The primary targets are warehouses used to store fuel and glide bombs to cripple Russia's air power.
According to Russian authorities in Volgograd, a falling drone started fire at a military air base in the residential village of Marinovka. An unconfirmed video posted on Russian social media showed the Marinovka Air Base on fire, with thick smoke billowing into the sky.
Meanwhile, Russia's Ministry of Defense claimed it had repelled drones over five other regions overnight. Andrei Bocharov, the region's governor, posted on Telegram early on Aug. 22 that an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) attack was ""repelled,"" adding that the attack caused a fire at a defense ministry facility 185 miles from the border with Ukraine.
Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that while Ukrainian drones ""work exactly as they should,"" they are not enough for what needs to be done. Zelensky added that Ukraine needs more weapons, such as ""missile weapons."" (Related: Tokyo to provide $3.3 billion loan to Kyiv using frozen Russian assets.)
Zelensky's office released footage of his first public visit to the border region of Sumy, the staging ground for the incursion, where he met with his top general. He also announced that Ukraine added one more settlement in Kursk to the several dozen it already controls and has more Russian military prisoners.
Col. Gen. Oleksandr Syrskiy briefed Zelensky on efforts to fortify Ukraine's eastern frontline near the strategic towns of Pokrovsk and Toretsk. Ukraine is targeting the towns as Russia advances and has yet to shift significant forces from there to resist Ukraine's fierce Kursk incursion.
In a meeting with Ukrainian diplomats, Zelensky explained that if allied countries ""lifted all the current restrictions on the use of weapons on Russian territory,"" Ukraine would no longer need to physically enter areas such as the Kursk region to protect Ukrainian citizens in the border communities and cut down Russia's ""potential for aggression."" He added that any further delay by Ukrainian allies concerning long-range capabilities is becoming ""the most effective support for Russia's offensive potential.""
In May, the Biden administration eased restrictions on the use of American-supplied weapons after Russia reinvaded Ukraine's northern Kharkiv region, allowing Kyiv to use artillery and fire short-range rockets from High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers against command posts, arms depots and other assets across the border there.
However, the policy didn't allow Ukraine to use American-supplied rockets called Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) within Russia. Now, Zelensky's administration is appealing to the U.S. to untie its hands by allowing them to use the weapons.
A strategic oil storage facility in the southern Rostov region burned for several days after it was targeted in a recent drone strike. Previously, a Ukrainian official said it had conducted its largest drone attack on Russian military airfields since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war, with strikes in Voronezh, Kursk, Savasleyka and Borisoglebsk.
A Ukrainian drone attack on the Lipetsk airfield also destroyed stockpiles of guided bombs earlier this August.
But while drone strikes are inflicting damage on Russian military resources, Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London, explained that the total damage so far ""isn't strategically significant.""
But Bronk noted the current rate of damage Ukraine has inflicted on air bases is something the Russians ""cannot just accept"" as it could become a serious problem over time.
If Ukraine keeps targeting air bases within Russia, the former could force Moscow to relocate air defense systems away from frontline areas. According to Bronk, this has already reduced glide bomb sortie rates by making the Russians fly farther on average to and from their bases to the front.
Douglas Barrie, a senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, said the increasing quantity and range of Ukrainian drone attacks is becoming a source of frustration for Russia.

5718,fake,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-02-06,"I’ve mentioned this a few times in passing, but I’ve never done a full article on it…
And I’ve never heard anyone else even raise the issue.
But it’s going to be one of those things where once you see it, you can’t ever unsee it. Or perhaps more accurately in this case, once I point it out, you’ll never be able to forget it. And it will frame how you see all this “foreign aid”.
I’m sure most of you reading this do not support the hundreds of billions of dollars we keep sending Ukraine, but I’m about to make it so much worse for you…
Very simply, it’s this: Did you know that the money we are sending Ukraine is structured as pure GIFTS?
If that doesn’t immediately blow you away, let me unpack that for you…
Of course they don’t use the word “gift” they use the word “grants” because it sounds better but they both mean the same thing — namely, that Ukraine never has to pay the money back.
Even the Left-Leaning ChatGPT admitted as much:
The financial aid the United States has been providing to Ukraine in recent years is a mix of both direct budgetary support and military assistance, rather than being structured as loans that need to be repaid. According to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the U.S. has provided billions in direct budgetary support to help Ukraine manage the acute budget deficit caused by the conflict, including funds to keep basic government services running and support for emergency responders. This assistance is designed to help the Government of Ukraine withstand economic, social, and political pressures and does not need to be repaid.
In addition to budgetary support, a significant portion of U.S. aid has been allocated to military and security assistance to help Ukraine defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. This includes funding for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which pays for training, weapons, and other military assistance, as well as funds to replenish U.S. weapons sent to Ukraine and for the Foreign Military Financing Program, enabling Ukraine to purchase new military equipment from the U.S.
Overall, the aid is part of the U.S.’s commitment to support Ukraine in the face of aggression, with the aim of ensuring the country’s stability and security. The funding for humanitarian and economic aid is provided with the understanding that it is a grant to support Ukraine’s immediate needs and long-term recovery, rather than a loan to be repaid.
I asked a second time just to confirm — Here was my follow-up question: “So none of the money given by the USA to Ukraine ever needs to be paid back?”
Answer:
The financial assistance provided by the United States to Ukraine, especially in the context of the recent aggression, has largely been structured as grants rather than loans. This means that these funds, including direct budgetary support and military aid, do not need to be paid back by Ukraine. The aid is intended to help the country address its immediate needs, support its government functions, and bolster its defense capabilities in the face of external aggression.
For instance, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has provided substantial direct budgetary support to Ukraine, aimed at alleviating the country’s budget deficit caused by the conflict and ensuring the continuity of essential government services. This kind of support is designed to be non-repayable and is given to help Ukraine withstand economic, social, and political pressures resulting from the conflict.
Moreover, the financial aid for military and security purposes, including funds allocated through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative and the Foreign Military Financing Program, is also provided as support that Ukraine is not required to repay. These funds are intended for Ukraine to purchase military equipment, receive training, and enhance its defense capabilities against aggression.
In summary, the financial aid from the U.S. to Ukraine in recent years, including both direct budgetary support and military assistance, is structured as grants that do not require repayment. This approach underscores the U.S. commitment to supporting Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and resilience in the face of challenges.
Are you kidding me?
If it’s still not knocking you off your chair, allow me to put it in a different context….
We’ve all heard about our National Debt, right?
How it’s out of control?
Here’s a picture for you from the US Debt Clock:
Yes, that would $34 TRILLION!
And here’s how fast it has been growing recently (and only accelerating):
- 2024: $34+ trillion
- 2023: $32 trillion
- 2022: $30.9 trillion
- 2021: $28.4 trillion
- 2020: $26.9 trillion
- 2019: $22.7 trillion
Why do we have that National Debt?
We all took high school government / civics class, right?
It was debt we borrowed as a nation to finance things like the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, the War of 1812, and so on!
When we needed to finance a war, we BORROWED the money, and we’re still paying it back hundreds of years later in 2024!
So our children are saddled with debt for centuries and it’s only growing and becoming more and more impossible to pay back, and what do we do?
Do we take HUNDREDS of BILLIONS of dollars and try to pay it down?
Nah.
It would be much wiser to just give that money away to Ukraine!!
Folks, this is treason — point blank, no other way to say it.
Even if you assume we want to help Ukraine (which I do not agree with that premise) but even so if that were the case, it should be structured like any other business transaction — a repayable loan! Just like we had to do!
Our politicians have violated their oaths of office and shown allegiance to other countries (Ukraine and Israel) far above any allegiance to the United States.
No one would ever in their right minds do this!
Unless….
Unless it was all one big money-laundering operation?
In that case it makes perfect sense:
FTX Money Laundering Scheme To Ukraine CONFIRMED?
FTX Money Laundering Scheme To Ukraine CONFIRMED?
Buckle up folks!
I have a MAJOR update on a story we first brought you back in the Fall of 2022.
""Fall"" is appropriate because that's when crypto firm FTX had its massive fall from grace.
And now just this week it looks like we may have confirmation that our reporting back in 2022 was 100% accurate.
Imagine that.
Let me back up for just a minute in case we have people who are new to this story or who need a refresher.
I'll publish our full reporting from 2022 down below but here's the quick recap...
This image explains it perfectly:

You pay taxes...
Taxes out the ears!
Then the US Government takes your tax dollars and sends billions upon billions over to Ukraine...
Ukraine then invested a big chunk of that money in FTX (that's called money laundering)...
FTX donates huge amounts back to the Democrat party...
The Democrats then use that money to buy, influence and steal elections.
What a great system!
And if you think that's just crazy Noah coming up with a crazy conspiracy theory, it's not.
Here is Elon Musk exposing it too:

NOW does it make sense why billions of your tax dollars are going to Ukraine every month?
You didn't honestly think we were just giving it all away, did you?
Of course not!
It's a complex money laundering operation!
Ok, now here's the update.
Prepare to have your mind blown.
This is truly ""hidden in plain sight"".
So we start here with the understanding that after FTX collapsed it owed customers about $8.7 BILLION:
JUST IN: New report shows FTX owed its customers $8.7 BILLION after commingling and misusing their deposits.
Take your #Bitcoin off exchanges!!
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 26, 2023
Ok, you with me so far?
FTX is in the hole $8.7 BILLY.
But remember, FTX was a key player in the money laundering operation, so they have to be made whole.
Then this happens:

Remember that from last week?
The Pentagon ""accidentally"" sent Ukraine $6.2 billion dollars!
So, uh, when you accidentally send $6.2 billy, do you call and get a refund or something?
Of course that's an EXTRA $6.2 billion on top of the billions we are sending weekly:

Folks, it's CORRUPTION, not ""mistakes"".
Ok, now stay with me because here's the final piece...
To recap:
FTX needs $8.7 Billion...
$6.2 Billion ""accidentally"" gets sent to the wrong place...
Now here it is:
FTX suddenly ""recovers"" $7 billion!
Wow, it's a miracle!
JUST IN: Bankrupt FTX says they have recovered $7 billion in liquid assets.

Take a look:
MAJOR Republican RINOs Caught In FTX Donation Scandal...
We're going to name names...
If you've been following this Sam Bankman-Fried / FTX scandal, you know this is big.
In fact, it's looking like Biden, Ukraine, Crypto and Pedos....are all possibly connected.
More on that at the end of this article -- jump down there first if you don't know anything about this story and need to get caught up to speed first.
We already knew Biden and many top Dems were ensnarled in this thing, and the crooked MSM is doing everything they can to give them cover.
But here's what's also been ignored: it's not just the Democrats.
I've been telling you for 7 years now, it's NEVER been about Republican vs. Democrat.
That's a fake dichotomy designed to keep you distracted.
R's and D's are mostly on the same team.
In fact, I estimate there are maybe 10-20 honest people left in the entire D.C. system.
One is Trump.
Another is Kari Lake.
And there are probably no more than 20 others -- if that many.
Everyone else, whether they've got an (R) or a (D) in front of their name is all crooked and sold out.
So sad to see what they've done to our country.
Let's get into the details...
According to Bloomberg, McConnell took $1 million:
From Bloomberg, here's more:
FTX US, a part of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire that catered to American customers, contributed to a super-PAC fighting for control of the Senate in the midterm election just days before the company’s collapse.
The Senate Leadership Fund, which is aligned with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and was the top spender in the 2022 midterms, received the $1 million donation on Oct. 27, according to its most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission. Only a couple of weeks later, more than a 100 FTX-related companies, including the US arm, filed for bankruptcy, and Bankman-Fried resigned as head of the corporate group.
The contributor listed on the FEC donation report is West Realm Shires Services Inc. and FTX US is its commercial name.
The Senate Leadership Fund did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The super-PAC spent $239 million in the midterms on behalf of Republican candidates, according to OpenSecrets, which tracks money in politics.
While several members of Congress, including Illinois Senator Richard Durbin, a Democrat, and Republican Representative Kevin Hern of Oklahoma have said they would return donations from FTX executives or give the money to charities, there isn’t a requirement in election law for committees to return donations to companies that go bankrupt.
FTX US also gave $750,000 to the Congressional Leadership Fund and $150,000 to the American Patriots PAC, both of which supported House Republican candidates. It gave $100,000 to the Alabama Conservatives Fund, which backed Republican Katie Britt’s successful run for the state’s open Senate seat.
Individual executives at the broader FTX company have given far more money. Bankman-Fried emerged as major donor to Democratic candidates leading up to the Nov. 8 midterm elections, donating most of the $39.4 million that he gave to them, FEC records show. One of his top lieutenants, Ryan Salame, gave $23.6 million -- mostly to Republicans.
We always knew Mitch was a snake, didn't we?
A rich snake.
According to a popular report circulating Twitter, here is the FULL LIST:
List of GOP committees and candidates who took money from FTX Executives. McConnell and McCarthy both took over $2mil. #DrainTheSwamp pic.twitter.com/SAYOVaJ4Me
— Bruce Porter Jr. (@NetworksManager) November 26, 2022
We have not been able to independently verify every name on this list, and to be fair we also note that candidates are rarely aware of every person or entity that makes a donation to their campaign -- but that said, you might want to write down these names and remember them.
Kari Lake says the corruption is SO DEEP and SO WICKED it will blow your mind:
The depth of the corruption will blow your mind. It is time to expose it and bring it down. https://t.co/KLngjf5fK0
— Kari Lake (@KariLake) November 26, 2022
Here is just a portion of the article Kari Lake posted...from Revolver read the full story here:
Just days ago, Bloomberg estimated 30-year-old Sam Bankman-Fried’s (SBF) personal wealth at an astonishing $16 billion. Now, the disgraced FTX founder is essentially bankrupt, and if there is a shred of justice in the world, soon headed for prison.
The collapse of FTX and its founder is one of the most spectacular implosions in history. There is no shortage of narratives to mine for interesting article fodder. Celebrities like Tom Brady and his now ex-wife Gisele lost millions to the scam. There’s the Silicon Valley “smart money” that was hopelessly entranced by a wunderkind founder. SBF also used his ill-begotten lucre to become one of the largest donors in left-wing politics of the past four years. There’s also the FTX pet philosophy of “effective altruism,” the cult-like fad ideology of contemporary Silicon Valley that SBF exploited to conduct his fraud and justify taking enormous risks. And who can forget the 28-year-old girlboss CEO of Alameda Research Caroline Ellison, who bragged that her vast financial empire only requires “elementary school math” to turn profits, and whose public list of turn-ons includes “controlling major world governments.”
Last but not least, there’s the group sex (don’t worry, everyone involved in this “polycule” situation is hideous).
All of these storylines are being regurgitated ad nauseum by countless other media outlets. The story that Revolver is about to tell you is even bigger and more spectacular than all the other fascinating storylines listed above. In fact, dear reader, FTX may not even be the biggest scam in crypto. Another, even more spectacular scam may still be live, ready to collapse at any moment… if anyone decides to take a real look at it.
The story you’re about to hear concerns the third-largest crypto-currency on the planet, which you’ve probably never heard of. It is a story of how a former Disney child-actor — a Jeffrey Epstein associate who was embroiled in an under-age sex scandal — bizarrely emerged as one of the world’s strangest crypto-currency moguls. It is the story that raises serious questions as to whether an entire cryptocurrency is a scam — effectively a private money-printer. And to top it all off, there is reason to believe that if this cryptocurrency is the scam that it appears to be, it will nonetheless be allowed to continue because of this particular cryptocurrency’s usefulness to intelligence agencies in funneling money to foreign rebel groups and jihadis with plausible deniability.
Sound crazy? Sound interesting? Strap in, it’s about to get wild.
USDT, or Tether, is what is known as a “stablecoin.” A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that, instead of fluctuating in value, is intended to hold to a consistent price. Tether is a USD stablecoin — each Tether is supposed to be equal in value to one U.S. dollar. While most cryptocurrencies are wildly speculative and backed by essentially nothing, each Tether is supposed to be backed directly by a U.S. dollar, or an extremely liquid, reliable investment like a U.S. treasury bond.
These USD stablecoins are used on cryptocurrency exchanges to conduct on-the-blockchain trades in lieu of using actual U.S. dollars. Without stablecoins like Tether, the current crypto ecosystem simply would not exist. There are multiple USD stablecoins, but Tether is by far the most popular. According to coinmarketcap.com, Tether has the third highest market cap of any crypto currency at $66 billion, trailing only Bitcoin and Ethereum. Today, fully half of all bitcoin trades globally are executed using Tether.
A year ago, crypto news site Protos summarized Tether this way:
If cryptocurrency was an engine, Tether (USDT) is one of its pistons.
Over the past seven years, the maverick stablecoin has evolved into a primary crutch for the ecosystem. It’s a tool for onboarding new money, managing and growing liquidity, pricing digital assets, and generally oiling crypto markets to keep them smooth.
Tether boasted a $1 billion market capitalization when Bitcoin hit $20,000 at the end of 2017. This year, it’s a $70 billion-plus powerhouse.
Practically every crypto exchange supports USDT trade in some form. The makeup of Tether’s reserves and its inner workings are yet to be disclosed in clear detail.
Still, the question of who exactly buys Tether directly from its parent company Bitfinex has remained unanswered since its inception way back in 2014.
Earlier this year, Protos shed light on that mystery by reporting that just two companies, Alameda Research and Cumberland Global, were responsible for seeping roughly two-thirds of all Tether into the crypto ecosystem.
Did that last sentence set off any alarm bells? It should have. Alameda Research is the quantitative trading firm founded by Sam Bankman-Fried. Bankman-Fried and his partner in crime, Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, allegedly propped up their trading firm by plundering FTX customer accounts.
The inner workings of Tether remain remarkably opaque.
New Tethers are supposed to only be minted, and added to the crypto ecosystem, when somebody gives Tether Limited dollars to create them. And if that’s how it all worked, Tether would be fine.
But there is no evidence Tether actually works this way. We repeat: There is no proof that Tether stablecoins are backed by the store of tangible assets that is supposed to justify their value.
Despite first being released eight years ago, Tether has never been audited in any way. It first promised an audit in 2017…to, you know, happen eventually. How is that coming along? As reported by the WSJ, “Tether Says Audit Is Still Months Away as Crypto Market Falters”:
…
Tether is designed to grease the rails of the roughly $1 trillion cryptocurrency market by promising each token can be redeemed for $1. Market observers have long questioned whether the firm’s reserves are sufficient and have been demanding audited information.
The company has been promising an audit since at least 2017. An audit is “likely months” away, said Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer of Tether Holdings Ltd., which issues the tether coin that recently carried a market value of $68 billion.
“Things are going slower than…we would like,” Mr. Ardoino said.
Instead of a full audit, Tether, like other leading stablecoins, publishes an “attestation” showing a snapshot of its reserves and liabilities, signed off by its accounting firm.
Audits are typically more thorough than other types of attestation. The attestations for some crypto companies sign off on the numbers provided by the company’s management for a specific date and time without testing the transactions before or after that date. That process can make the reports more vulnerable to being used to paint an unduly rosy picture.
A 2017 attestation of Tether was skewed by its sister company, Bitfinex, transferring $382 million to its bank account, hours before the accountants checked the numbers, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said last year.
Take a moment to register that: In 2017, when Tether’s total market cap was still under $1 billion, it needed a last-minute transfer of $382 million just to sly its way through a non-audit attestation of its assets. This is ominously reminiscent of the accounting trick used by borrowers to obtain so-called “liar loans” in the run-up to the 2008 subprime mortgage crash.
That 2017 attestation, incidentally, led the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to fine Tether $41 million last year, without the company admitting any wrongdoing. Tether also paid an $18.5 million fine to New York state to settle claims that it misrepresented its reserves. The settlement forced Tether and its associated Bitfinex exchange to cease operations in New York. Crucially, though, none of these fines have fully exposed how Tether works, forced it to change its methods, or even compelled it to admit wrongdoing. Tether essentially made a political payoff, it seems, and moved on.
You know things are fishy when even legendary scammer Jordan Belfort calls you out:
It’s important to state what is happening if Tether is not actually backed by the dollars that it claims. If Tether Limited is pumping out new Tethers without actually taking in an equal amount of USD, then it is essentially a privately-run money printer.
Just manufacture new Tethers, pump them into a crypto exchange, use them to buy bitcoin, then sell the bitcoin for real U.S. dollars.
That would be, in the words of Dire Straits, “Money For Nothing”:
To avoid a Dire Straits situation, in other words, the whole system must place its faith in the unaudited pinky promise of Tether’s management team. So, what remarkable financier is behind this arrangement? What person of impeccable morals is helming Tether such that it commands so much importance in the global crypto ecosystem despite doing so little to merit confidence?
Say, anybody remember the Mighty Ducks movies?
Or how about the Sinbad movie First Kid? Anybody ever catch that on The Disney Channel back in the day?
Meet Brock Pierce.
In the early 90s, Pierce enjoyed a brief career as a child actor. But before even reaching legal adulthood, Pierce pivoted into a new career, which soon ended bizarrely:
In the trailer for First Kid, the forgettable 1996 comedy about a Secret Service agent assigned to protect the president’s son, the title character, played by a teenage Brock Pierce, describes himself as “definitely the most powerful kid in the universe.” Now, the former child star is running to be the most powerful man in the world, as an Independent candidate for President of the United States.
Before First Kid, the Minnesota-born actor secured roles in a series of PG-rated comedies, playing a young Emilio Estevez in The Mighty Ducks, before graduating to smaller parts in movies like Problem Child 3: Junior in Love. When his screen time shrunk, Pierce retired from acting for a real executive role: co-founding the video production start-up Digital Entertainment Network (DEN) alongside businessman Marc Collins-Rector. At age 17, Pierce served as its vice president, taking in a base salary of $250,000.
DEN became “the poster child for dot-com excesses,” raising more than $60 million in seed investments and plotting a $75 million IPO. But it turned into a shorthand for something else when, in October of 1999, the three co-founders suddenly resigned. That month, a New Jersey man filed a lawsuit alleging Collins-Rector had molested him for three years beginning when he was 13 years old. The following summer, three former DEN employees filed a sexual-abuse lawsuit against Pierce, Collins-Rector, and their third co-founder, Chad Shackley. The plaintiffs later dropped their case against Pierce (he made a payment of $21,600 to one of their lawyers) and Shackley. But after a federal grand jury indicted Collins-Rector on criminal charges in 2000, the DEN founders left the country. When Interpol arrested them in 2002, they said they had confiscated “guns, machetes, and child pornography” from the trio’s beach villa in Spain.
Pierce managed to get out of his Interpol jam that without being charged, and his strange path through life continued.
“Wait, is there somehow an Epstein connection here?” you might be wondering. Oh, you bet there is an Epstein connection here.
In early 2011, about a decade after the Digital Entertainment Network imploded, [Brock] Pierce visited the Virgin Islands to attend “Mindshift,” a conference of top scientists hosted by Epstein. A representative for Pierce says he didn’t even know who Epstein was when he flew (commercial) to the event, which the financier had arranged as part of his elaborate effort to launder his lurid reputation. It was not even 18 months after Epstein had completed his slap-on-the-wrist solicitation sentence in Florida and registered as a sex offender.
…
Nothing suggests that anything of a sexual nature or anything untoward at all occurred at Mindshift. Pierce is only one of dozens of figures in Epstein’s dizzyingly vast network, and the link between the two may be nothing but a curiosity. But it is a strange tale: how a former child actor who never went to college ended up as an Epstein guest — a seemingly unlikely addition to a group that included a NASA computer engineer, an MIT professor of electrical engineering and a Nobel laureate in theoretical physics. “I don’t know what he had to do with science [or] why he was there,” says one person who attended.
So, we have the world’s third largest crypto currency, a stablecoin that has never been audited, founded by a washed up former child actor involved in a sex scandal with underaged minors that quietly dissipated without charges, who has prospered in crypto despite zero technical background, and who maintained a hard-to-explain connection to Jeffrey Epstein. But hey, Pierce says he hasn’t actually been involved with Tether since 2015. And maybe Pierce was just the “celebrity” face of the venture, and the other leaders have more legitimate background.
Tether’s CEO is Jean-Louis van der Velde:
The chief executive of Tether ran a company that faced a string of lawsuits in China over unpaid bills and fines for late tax payments before he helped launch the contentious stablecoin now at the heart of the crypto industry.
As crypto has moved from finance’s fringes to its mainstream, investors have increasingly relied on stablecoins, digital tokens backed by real-world assets, as a means to buy and sell volatile currencies such as bitcoin.
But as Tether’s role in the crypto universe has mushroomed since it was founded in 2014, with $78bn of its stablecoins now in circulation, so has scrutiny from regulators. The company’s rapid rise has also turned the spotlight on publicity-shy chief executive Jean-Louis van der Velde.
The 58-year-old Dutch native’s career, spanning IT sales in Hong Kong, Germany’s software industry and an ailing Chinese electronics manufacturer, gave few hints of the significant role he would later assume.
…
While US politicians race to gather more information on Tether, even some of the group’s biggest customers say they have had few dealings with its chief executive.
Sam Bankman-Fried, the chief executive of FTX, the Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange recently valued at $25bn, told the Financial Times earlier this year that he had only met van der Velde once in person.
“My sense is that he’s less involved in the external operations aspect of the business and more involved in internal management and leadership,” Bankman-Fried said. Another cryptocurrency executive who has had dealings with Tether’s management put it more bluntly: “I don’t know a lot about JL and most people don’t.”
Folks, I've been telling you that one day very soon EVERYTHING is going to come out.
The whole crooked and sick system is going to come crashing down on itself.
Can you see how that might happen now?
For years, people thought that would be impossible.
But when you build scam upon scam upon scam, and filth upon filth upon filth, well...sometimes it collapses under its own weight.
And the result is going to be glorious!
It feels like we are very close.
How many people does this take down?
Everyone except those 10-20 honest people in D.C.?
It's very likely.

I'll connect all the dots for you:
EXPOSED IN 90 SECONDS: Biden, Ukraine, Crypto and Pedos....All Connected?
I don't like to use hyperbole too often because then you become the boy who cried wolf and people don't listen to you as much.
So I'm careful with headlines like this, and I wrote this one intentionally because I believe it is true.
Folks, this is the big one, and it may just be the thing that ends up taking down not only Joe Biden but the entire crooked Democrat party.
Let me explain...
You've probably heard about a company called FTX recently and its ""founder"" Sam Bankman-Fried, who goes by ""SBF"".
If you've found the story confusing or too hard to follow, let me explain it really simply, because it is simple.
SBF appears to be a Government spook (or ""Useful Idiot"", we're not sure which yet).
But what is clear is the guy is mostly a complete bumbling idiot, and yet somehow rose to control billions, running one of the largest crypto exchanges out there.
Remember those Super Bowl ads with Tom Brady and Larry David?
That was FTX.
It rose up out of almost nowhere to suddenly be this behemoth.
What we're now learning is the whole thing was perhaps a full ponzi, perhaps just a fraud, perhaps just a total fake, but definitely it was not a real mega-company.
So last week, FTX suddenly shocks everyone and goes bankrupt with no warning.
The crypto market tanked, huge crash.
Bo Polny actually predicted the entire thing, more on that below...
But now as we're putting together the pieces and digging through the wreckage, we're learning this might have actually been the biggest money laundering operation of all time.
Remember all those BILLIONS upon BILLIONS that were going to Ukraine?
What if they were being laundered?
I mean, we all suspected it all along, right?
We just didn't know how the con worked.
Now we're learning, or at least we're starting to connect the dots.
We're still in the early stages here and I want to be clear we're still seeing in a room dimly lit, so this is still speculation at this point, but the puzzle pieces are all starting to fit together.
Here's basically how it went...
The U.S. takes billions upon billions of taxpayer dollars and funnels those over to Ukraine.
Ukraine then puts those billions into FTX (remember, it appears to not be a real company, more like a government plant).
FTX is owned by Sam Bankman-Fried.
SBF then takes the billions and donates them back to the Democrat party.
This part is not speculation: SBF was the #2 largest donor to the Democrats right behind George Soros.
The Democrat party then funnels the money to people like Joe Biden (10% for the Big Guy!) and uses it to buy seats, errrrrrrrr, I mean run elections, in all states at all levels.
End results?
Key Democrats end up with millions...
Races are stolen, errrrrrrrr ""won""...
And Americans are SREWED.
If this all ends up being true or even partially true, I just have one question: Is this treason?

Here is the Daily Caller:
Sam Bankman-Fried, prolific Democratic donor and ex-CEO of now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX, funded the campaigns of members of Congress overseeing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), one of the key bodies tasked with regulating the crypto industry and the subject of Bankman-Fried’s aggressive lobbying.
Bankman-Fried’s FTX is currently under investigation by the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after Bankman-Fried allegedly moved $10 billion in client assets from his crypto exchange to his trading firm Alameda Research, and a liquidity crisis at his exchange which prompted the company to file for bankruptcy. However, prior to the agency’s probe, Bankman-Fried aggressively courted the CFTC – and funded several key lawmakers charged with overseeing the agency, pouring cash into their campaign coffers.
The spectacular meltdown of the FTX crypto exchange has revealed it to be nothing more than a slush fund for Democrat candidates.
Sam Bankman-Fried stepped down as FTX CEO on Friday after it was announced his exchange had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the face of a multi-billion dollar liquidity crunch.
On midterm election day, Bankman-Fried managed to lose nearly 94% of his estimated $15.6 billion fortune.
The U.S. branch of FTX is now valued at $1, down from a peak of $8 billion in January. Bankman-Fried is now also under investigation by both the Department of Justice and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Prior to the midterms, Bankman-Fried was touted by POLITICO as the Democrats’ “newest megadonor” and “potential Democrat savior” second only to billionaire globalist George Soros.
“We’ve never seen something like this on this scale,” said Bradley Beychok, co-founder of American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic super PAC. “On our side, there’s a small pool of people who write these kinds of checks and they tend to be the same folks. But Sam, to his credit, came right in with a big splash.”
In fact, Bankman-Fried spent almost $40 million on Democrat candidates this year.
The 30-year-old Bankman-Fried has been a major force in Democratic politics, ranking as the party’s second-biggest individual donor in the 2021–2022 election cycle, according to Open Secrets, with donations totaling $39.8 million. That ranks only behind George Soros (about $128 million) but ahead of many other big names, including Michael Bloomberg ($28.3 million). What’s more, he had promised to spend far more on Democrats moving forward, predicting in May that he’d fund “north of $100 million” and had a “soft ceiling” of $1 billion for the 2024 elections.
He also donated $10 million to then-candidate Joe Biden in 2020.
A YouTuber named “Nobody Special Finance” succinctly explained the FTX “Ponzi scheme” that led to its collapse this week.
“The truth is, Sam Bankman-Fried is a liar and a crook,” said Nobody Special. “His personal crypto, FTX Token, was basically a Ponzi scheme … He used his Ponzi token as collateral to borrow billions of real dollars that he couldn’t pay back … He then used those real dollars to build an empire out of dying companies.”
“[Sam Bankman-Fried] then sold people cryptos like Bitcoin, or so they thought. What they really bought was an IOU.”
In essence, Bankman-Fried used his corrupt earnings to finance the Democrats’ midterm races to head off a “Red Wave.”
Now that FTX has imploded, Democrats are saving face by renewing calls for the crypto space to be heavily regulated.

3910,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-08-14,"WHO declares 2024 mpox surge a 'public health emergency of international concern'
The World Health Organization has declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern. Cases of mpox — previously called monkeypox — have been surging in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In recent weeks, cases have appeared in nearby African countries, including several that have never reported mpox cases before.
""What we're seeing is tip of the iceberg"" because of weaknesses in the surveillance system, says Dr. Dimie Ogoina, the chair of the emergency committee convened by WHO and an infectious disease physician at Niger Delta University in Nigeria.
""This is something that should concern us all,"" says WHO's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
WHO has declared seven public health emergencies in the past, including one for mpox in 2022. The type of mpox that is circulating now is known to be more deadly than the type that swept the globe two years ago.
""We need to be ... aggressive""
On Tuesday, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention took a similar step, declaring mpox an emergency.
Africa CDC has never done anything like this before.
""We can no longer be reactive — we need to be proactive and aggressive,” says Dr. Jean Kaseya, director-general of Africa CDC. ""This is a fight for all Africans and we will fight it together.""
In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), children make up the majority of the 14,000 reported cases and 511 deaths so far in 2024. Those numbers roughly match the number of cases reported in all of last year in the country — and they dwarf the mpox numbers reported in 2022.
""[The declaration] is a wake-up call for the world that urgent action is needed,” said Dr. Nicole Lurie, executive director of emergency preparedness and response at the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, headquartered in Norway, in a statement.
Dr. Boghuma Titanji, assistant professor of medicine at Emory University, said in a statement that the declaration is ""a crucial step toward enhancing coordination among African countries to address the ongoing mpox outbreak.""
Why Africa is so worried
In the last couple of weeks, there has been a new and alarming development. Mpox has been detected in countries that have never previously identified cases. About 50 confirmed cases and more suspected cases have been reported in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, according to World Health Organization officials.
It is with past health emergencies in mind that Africa CDC is trying to move quickly and garner international support. ""We were abandoned during COVID time, and today we don't want to be again abandoned. We don't want to be dependent. We are taking appropriate action,"" says Kaseya, noting that declaring a public health emergency is a new power that the African Union gave to the agency in 2023. Kaseya says that the agency sought input from more than 600 experts and that the scientific committee that was convened to consider the mpox situation unanimously recommended the emergency declaration.
Kaseya says it's particularly concerning that about 70% of cases in the DRC are in children under 18. ""This one is a major alarm for the world,"" he says. ""We are losing the youth in Africa.""
Experts say the higher number of cases and deaths among children is likely because they don't have protection from the smallpox vaccine — which was discontinued after that related virus was eliminated in 1980 — and because about 40% of children in the region are malnourished, making it harder for their bodies to fight off the virus.
The U.S. response
There's concern about mpox in the U.S. as well. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an mpox alert last week. While the risk to the general population in the U.S. remains low, Christina Hutson, senior science adviser at the U.S. CDC, says it's important for clinicians, health departments and travelers to be aware of the virus's spread in Africa and be vigilant about symptoms.
In addition, last week the U.S. pledged nearly $424 million to help with what the U.S. Agency for International Development calls an ""ongoing catastrophe"" in the DRC, plus $10 million to respond to mpox and 50,000 mpox vaccine doses.
While Japan, the U.S., the European Union and vaccine manufacturers are working on vaccine donations, Africa CDC says the need far outstrips what's in the pipeline.
""We need to have vaccines. Today, we are just talking about almost 200,000 doses [becoming] available. We need at least 10 million doses,"" says Kaseya. ""The vaccine is so expensive — we can put it around $100 per dose. There are not so many countries in Africa that can afford the cost of this vaccine.""
The type of mpox spreading in the DRC's east — particularly among sex workers and other adults — and into some of the neighboring countries is a subtype called clade Ib. (Clade is the term used for mpox variants.) This is a new type of mpox that has kept scientists on their toes, discovering new information that is both good and bad.
It's harder for diagnostic tests to pick it up because of a genetic change in the virus, says Hutson of the U.S. CDC. It's also the first time clade Ib has been spread through sexual transmission. However, it also seems less fatal than the original clade I circulating elsewhere in the DRC. The number of people who have died has dropped below 1%. At least that, she says, is a glimmer of good news."
3823,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-04-17,"The debate has also weakened conservative Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson's standing, after he admitted to caving into pressure from party members on the issue.
Beyond lowering the age, the proposals also aim to make it simpler for a person to change their legal gender.
""The process today is very long, it can take up to seven years to change your legal gender in Sweden,"" Peter Sidlund Ponkala, president of the Swedish Federation for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Intersex Rights (RFSL), told AFP.
Under the proposal, two new laws would replace the current legislation: one regulating surgical procedures to change gender, and one regulating the administrative procedure to change legal gender in the official register.
If parliament adopts the bill as expected on Wednesday, people will be able to change their legal gender starting at the age of 16, though those under 18 will need the approval of their parents, a doctor, and the National Board of Health and Welfare.
A diagnosis of ""gender dysphoria"" -- where a person may experience distress as a result of a mismatch between their biological sex and the gender they identify as -- will no longer be required.
Surgical procedures to transition would, like now, be allowed from the age of 18, but would no longer require the Board of Health and Welfare's approval.
The removal of ovaries or testes would however only be allowed from the age of 23, unchanged from today.
Gender dysphoria surging
A number of European countries have already passed laws making it easier for people to change their legal gender.
Citing a need for caution, Swedish authorities decided in 2022 to halt hormone therapy for minors except in very rare cases, and ruled that mastectomies for teenage girls wanting to transition should be limited to a research setting.
Sweden has seen a sharp rise in gender dysphoria cases.
The trend is particularly visible among 13- to 17-year-olds born female, with an increase of 1,500 percent since 2008, according to the Board of Health and Welfare.
While tolerance for gender transitions has long been high in the progressive and liberal country, political parties across the board have been torn by internal divisions over the new proposal, and academics, health care professionals and commentators have come down on both sides of the issue.
A poll published this week suggested almost 60 percent of Swedes oppose the proposal, while only 22 percent back it.
Some critics have expressed concerns about biological males in women's locker rooms and prisons, and fear the legal change will encourage confused youths to embark down the path toward surgical transitions.
Others have insisted that more study is needed given the lack of explanation for the sharp rise in gender dysphoria.
Deep divisions
""There is a clear correlation with different types of psychiatric conditions or diagnoses, such as autism,"" Annika Strandhall, head of the women's wing of the Social Democrats (S-kvinnor), told Swedish news agency TT.
""We want to pause this (age change) and wait until there is further research that can explain this increase"" in gender dysphoria cases.
RFSL's Ponkala disagreed, saying the simplified process was important for transgender people, a ""vulnerable"" group.
""They face a lot of risks... We see that the political climate has hardened,"" he said.
Kristersson, the prime minister, has defended the proposal as ""balanced and responsible"".
But he has also admitted he wanted to keep the age at 18 but gave in to strong forces in his party.
His own government has been split on the issue, with the Moderates and the Liberals largely in favour and the Christian Democrats and Sweden Democrats against.
He has had to seek support from the left-wing opposition to get the proposal through parliament.
If adopted, the new law would come into force on July 1, 2025.

5991,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-11-13,"The largest political group in the European Parliament is counting on support from the far right to gut a law that would keep products linked to deforestation off the market, in a move that risks undermining the EU’s position at the COP29 climate talks.
The Greens in the European Parliament have warned that a bid by the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) to water down a new EU law designed to break the link between demand in Europe and deforestation around the world could damage the EU’s credibility at the COP29 talks.
Under pressure from the EPP, the European Commission proposed last month to postpone application of the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) to give companies an extra year to prepare. The change has already been approved by governments in the EU Council.
But despite an understanding that the implementation deadline would be the only substantial change, the largest group in the parliament has proposed a raft of amendments ahead of a final vote tomorrow (14 November) that would substantially weaken the law.
“I truly hope that at the end of the day [the EU] won't look ridiculous in front of the partners and international community, backtracking on one of the biggest achievements of the previous Commission,” former environment commissioner Virginijus Sinkevičius told reporters today.
The EPP has tabled 15 amendment proposals, which would extend the delay to two years, introduce a new category of ‘no risk’ countries and exempt traders from the bulk of reporting obligations.
The group says in its proposal that the changes it wants are justified by a need to ‘avoid unnecessary administrative burden and the additional costs’, and is apparently counting on support from conservative and nationalist groups to push them through.
Backtracking on the legislation would lead to “uncertainty” over EU’s ability to follow up its headline climate action goals with concrete legislation, Sinkevičius said. “It would also show that we are not a reliable partner,"" he said.
“A significant job has been done in explaining [the law] to…countries, especially those that are going to be affected, but also working with the rest of the world to ensure that they also take steps in adopting a similar legislation,” he said.
Fellow Green MEP Anna Cavazzini, who chairs the parliament’s internal market committee, pointed to contradictions in the EPP’s position, and the potential for the “chaos” of a protracted stand-off.
Having originally supported the EUDR, the group has successfully pushed for a one-year delay – but if its fresh amendments are endorsed with support from the far-right, the parliament will find itself in opposition to the EU Council, and there will be no time to change the law before it takes effect on 30 December.
“For me, it's one of the clearest laws that exist, because it will prohibit products from areas that have been recently deforested – with a clear deadline,” Cavazzini said. “I have the feeling, this ‘bureaucracy’ discussion is just being used at the moment to kill basically everything.”"
2804,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-07-31,"Authorities in Ukraine say the attack was Russia's biggest drone barrage against Ukraine in seven months.
Ukrainian forces shot down all 89 Shahed drones launched by Russia in a nighttime attack on the country, Ukraine’s air force said on Wednesday, in what was said to be one of the largest drone barrages this year.
No damage or injuries were immediately reported in the bombardment, which mostly targeted the region of Kyiv, the capital.
""Yesterday, the enemy used multiple rocket launchers and artillery to attack the towns of Beryslav, Zmiivka, Shliakhove, Novokaira, Tiahyntsi, and Odradokamianka. Residential buildings and outbuildings were damaged as a result of hostile attacks,"" said Volodymyr Litvinov, head of the Beryslav District Military Administration.
Russia deployed the same number of Shahed drones in an attack on January 1, an air force statement read. Both Ukraine and Russia have heavily relied on explosive drones throughout the war and are racing to develop additional countermeasures.
The Russian drones are being shot down by Ukraine’s Soviet-era aircraft, according to Anatolii Khrapchynskyi, an aviation expert in Kyiv.
“The air force is using electronic jamming against the drones’ GPS, which forces the drones to fly at a higher altitude, which then makes it easier for Ukrainian aircraft to strike them down,” he said.
He added that tactic will likely also be used when US made F-16 fighter jets are received in the coming days by Kyiv’s European partners.
Ukraine has been pushing its Western allies for F-16s for Ukraine for months, saying they were critically needed to fight back against the onslaught of missiles Russia has fired against it.
The F-16 is specialised in suppressing enemy air defences. The West has hesitantly moved toward providing the jets after previous concerns that arming Ukraine with advanced weaponry would further escalate the war with Russia.
Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces said they struck more military targets on Russian soil overnight.
They hit a warehouse for weapon storage and military equipment in the border region of Kursk, a statement from Ukraine’s General Staff said."

A study released in July of excess mortality in 125 countries during the covid pandemic found the major causes of death globally stemmed from public health establishment’s response, including mandates and lockdowns that caused severe stress, harmful medical interventions and the covid injections.
The authors said the theory that the virus caused the deaths is propped up by mass virus-testing campaigns that should be abandoned.
Instead, they found that in many places, there was no excess mortality until the vaccines were rolled out, and most countries showed temporal associations between vaccine rollouts and increases in all-cause mortality.
Let’s not lose touch…Your Government and Big Tech are actively trying to censor the information reported by The Exposé to serve their own needs. Subscribe now to make sure you receive the latest uncensored news in your inbox…
A study published on 19 July 2024 authored by Denis Rancourt, Joseph Hickey and Christian Linard found that the excess all-cause mortality for the years 2020 to 2023 in 125 countries is incompatible with a pandemic viral respiratory disease.
The authors argue that the three primary causes of death associated with the excess all-cause mortality over this period are due to mandated measures such as lockdowns; harmful medical interventions such as the use of ventilators and the denial of use of antibiotics; and, covid injections.
We have previously published an article about this study which you can read HERE. The following is a Substack Note posted by Denis Rancourt last Monday, 9 September 2024.
In Our Extensive Work We Concluded
In our extensive work we concluded that the three primary causes of death associated with the excess all-cause mortality during (and after) the covid period are:
(1) Biological (including psychological) stress from mandates such as lockdowns and associated socio-economic structural changes.
(2) Non-covid-19-vaccine medical interventions such as mechanical ventilators and drugs (including denial of treatment with antibiotics).
(3) Covid-19 vaccine injection rollouts, including repeated rollouts on the same populations.
In all cases – for all three identified primary causes of death – a proximal or clinical cause of death associated (such as on death certificates) with the quantified excess all-cause mortality is a respiratory condition or infection. Therefore, we distinguish (and define) true primary causes of death from the pervasive and accompanying proximal or clinical cause of death as respiratory.
We understand the covid period mortality catastrophe to be precisely what happens when governments cause global disruptions and assaults against populations. We emphasise the importance of biological stress from sudden and profound structural societal changes and of medical assaults (including denial of treatment for bacterial pneumonias, repeated vaccine injections, etc.). We estimate that such a campaign of disruptions and assaults in a modern world will produce a global all-ages mortality rate of >0.1 % of population per year, as was also the case in the 1918 mortality catastrophe.
We are compelled to state that the public health establishment and its agents fundamentally caused all the excess mortality in the covid period, via assaults on populations, harmful medical interventions and covid-19 vaccine rollouts.
We conclude that nothing special would have occurred in terms of mortality had a pandemic not been declared and had the declaration not been acted upon.

3637,fake,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-09-11,"According to the public health agency's guidance issued on Aug. 30, children as young as six months old should get injected with either two doses of the 2024-2025 Moderna COVID-19 vaccine or three doses of the 2024-2025 Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.
For the latest Moderna injection, the CDC recommends that babies get the first dose at six months and the second dose a month after the first. For the latest Pfizer shot, the agency advises that the first dose should be given at six months. The second dose should be given three weeks after the first, and the third dose should be given at least eight weeks after the second.
Following the CDC's guidance, nine-month-old babies must have been injected with the COVID-19 vaccine to be considered ""up to date"" with their vaccination. But the problem is that both the latest versions of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are not licensed for use on children under 12. This is because the Food and Drug Administration only granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for the new vaccines.
Children's Health Defense (CHD) CEO Mary Holland remarked that the CDC is ""absolutely misleading"" the public by asserting that COVID-19 vaccines granted EUA are safe and effective. This is because EUA vaccines are not held to the same safety or efficacy standards as licensed vaccines.
""By law, EUA products 'may be effective' and they have not undergone the safety testing required to permit licensing. This is one more horrific example of the CDC putting profits before people and acting as an unethical arm of Big Pharma's marketing operation,"" she said.
""The earlier COVID-19 shots have been proven unsafe and ineffective. Now we're asked to believe that newer versions are miraculously safe and effective?""
According to the CDC, ""the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the known risks of COVID-19 and possible severe complications.""
But Brian Hooker, CHD's chief scientific officer, begged to differ. He pointed to research showing the dangers of vaccine induced myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation) and pericarditis (heart lining inflammation).
""It is criminal that these untested vaccines are being recommended to infants and children, especially given the fraudulent tactics to market them to an unsuspecting public,"" Hooker said. He stressed that there are still no licensed COVID-19 vaccines available for children under 12, so all COVID-19 injections given to young children are EUA products.
The Defender explained that if a parent takes her children to get injected with the COVID-19 vaccine, her 12-year old could receive the fully licensed one. Meanwhile, her 11-year-old must get injected with the unlicensed COVID-19 vaccines available only under EUA.
Hooker described the CDC's actions as problematic given that historically, regulatory authorities have interpreted the meaning of ""safe"" as the benefits outweighing the risks. He continued: ""With the risk to children of dying from a COVID-19 infection being statistically zero, it is unclear if there is any benefit.""
Holland ultimately concluded that the CDC's new guidance is an insult to people’s intelligence. ""I pray that parents will have the good sense to say no to these dangerous and unnecessary shots for babies,"" she said.

But critics say it has become the latest mouthpiece for nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz party, amplifying its narratives while slamming those critical of the government and most recently the EU.
Since the beginning of the year, Megafon has poured more than 650 million forints ($1.8 million) into promoting its content on Facebook, according to estimates by the platform's owner Meta.
No other political party in the EU has spent as much as Megafon over the same period, according to AFP.
While some clips accuse European leaders of ""wanting nuclear war"", others suggest that women might soon be forced to produce weapons in factories and children may be sent to the front lines.
Several videos also featured remarks by French President Emmanuel Macron on the possibility of sending Western troops to Ukraine and his proposed debate on the role of the country's nuclear arsenal in Europe.
But Macron's remarks were taken out of context and skewed to portray European leaders as wanting ""a third world war"".
An advocate for peace talks between Ukraine and Russia and the Kremlin's closest EU ally, Orban has characterised the upcoming European Parliament elections as a referendum on the war, saying he was now ""fighting for peace alone"" in the bloc.
'Seemingly infinite' funding
During Orban's 14 years in power, Hungary's media landscape has been transformed, with public media long a government mouthpiece and large swathes of the private media sector owned by pro-government allies.
But the nationalist leader still had to win over the electoral support of younger, urban citizens, who had increasingly been turning online including for news.
In the wake of the opposition's surprise win in the capital Budapest and other larger cities in 2019, Megafon was born.
""Immense amounts of money were poured into dominating social media platforms"" as if Megafon had ""seemingly infinite"" resources, Kata Horvath of the Mertek Media Monitor watchdog told AFP.
Unlike other influencers with ""grassroots support"", Megafon's content creators ""owe the majority of their views to advertising"", she explained.
The source of Megafon's funding remains unclear.
In recent weeks, Megafon ""has spent so much money that I can't imagine a Hungarian who hasn't seen them in their Facebook feed"", said analyst Robert Laszlo of the Political Capital think-tank.
Megafon says it is financed by private donors, rejecting allegations by independent media that taxpayers' money funnelled through various organisations was involved.
In the past, Megafon's director Istvan Kovacs, a former Fidesz candidate, said the centre has ""no formal relations"" with any political party.
Megafon did not respond to an interview request by AFP.
'Digital freedom fighter'
According to expert Laszlo, Megafon is simply ""another tool for the government"" to ""convey the key messages of the ruling party louder, and more simplistically"".
""Pieces from real speeches and videos are manipulatively edited to appeal to emotions"" in order to forge ""hostile narratives, where there is always someone to blame"", he said.
Through Megafon's clips, Orban's Fidesz aims to reach more Hungarians who do not follow politics closely ""but can still be persuaded to lean towards the party"", Laszlo added.
In addition to its costly political campaigns, Megafon offers free four-day training courses to anyone who seeks to become a ""right-wing digital freedom fighter"".
More than a thousand people have already taken the training courses, according to the centre.
Among them are dozens of Fidesz candidates standing in local elections on June 9, an investigation from AFP partner Lakmusz recently revealed.
In early May, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto praised Megafon's efforts at a public event organised by the centre, calling on them to ""fight a fierce online battle"" in the coming weeks.

6086,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-04-18,"In Europe, southern countries like Spain and Italy will bear the brunt of declining incomes, while Arctic-adjacent nations could benefit.
The climate crisis will reduce global income by about a fifth in the next 25 years compared to a fictional world that's not warming.
That’s according to a new study which predicts people in the world’s poorest areas and those least responsible for heating the atmosphere will take the biggest monetary hit.
Climate change’s economic bite out of incomes is already locked in at about $38 trillion (€35.6 trillion) a year by 2049, researchers at Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) found. By 2100 the financial cost could hit twice what previous studies estimate.
“Our analysis shows that climate change will cause massive economic damages within the next 25 years in almost all countries around the world, also in highly-developed ones such as Germany and the US, with a projected median income reduction of 11 per cent each and France with 13 per cent,” says study co-author Leonie Wenz, a climate scientist and economist.
These damages are compared to a baseline of no climate change and are then applied against overall expected global growth in gross domestic product, explains study lead author and climate scientist Max Kotz.
So while it's 19 per cent globally less than it could have been with no climate change, in most places, income will still grow, just not as much because of warmer temperatures.
Temperature rise will cause biggest loss of income
For the past dozen years, scientists and others have been focusing on extreme weather such as heatwaves, floods, droughts and storms as having the biggest climate impact.
But when it comes to financial hit the researchers found “the overall impacts are still mainly driven by average warming, overall temperature increases,” Kotz says. It harms crops and hinders labour production.
“Those temperature increases drive the most damages in the future because they're really the most unprecedented compared to what we've experienced historically,” Kotz says.
In 2023, a record-hot year, the global average temperature was 1.35 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial times, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The globe has not had a month cooler than 20th century average since February 1979.
Where will see the biggest income drops due to climate change?
In the United States, the southeastern and southwestern states get economically pinched more than the northern ones with parts of Arizona and New Mexico taking the biggest monetary hit, according to the study.
In Europe, southern regions, including parts of Spain and Italy, get hit harder than places like Denmark or northern Germany.
Only Arctic adjacent areas - Canada, Russia, Norway, Finland and Sweden - benefit, Kotz says.
It also means countries which have historically produced fewer greenhouse gas emissions per person and are least able to financially adapt to warming weather are getting the biggest financial harms too, he adds.
The world's poorest countries will suffer 61 per cent bigger income loss than the richest ones, the study calculated.
“It underlies some of the injustice elements of climate,” Kotz says.
When will cutting emissions make a difference?
Dispiritingly, the study finds that economic harms over the next 25 years are locked in with emission cuts producing only small changes in the income reduction.
But in the second half of this century two different possible futures are simulated, showing that cutting carbon emissions now really pays off because of how the heat-trapping gases accumulate, Kotz says.
If the world could curb carbon pollution and get down to a trend that limits warming to 2 degrees Celsius - which is the upper limit of the 2015 Paris climate agreement - then the financial hit will stay around 20 per cent in global income, he adds.
But if emissions increase in a worst case scenario, the financial wallop will be closer to 60 per cent.
That shows that the public shouldn't think it's a financial “doomsday” and nothing can be done.
Still, it's worse than a 2015 study that predicted a worst case income hit of about 25 per cent by the end of the century.
How are climate-driven economic losses calculated?
Published in the journal Nature yesterday (17 April), this new study looked deeper than past research. It examined 1,600 global areas that are smaller than countries, took several climate factors into account and studied how long climate economic shocks last, Kotz says.
The study explored past economic impacts on average global domestic product per person and uses computer simulations to look into the future to come up with their detailed calculations.
Marshall Burke, the Stanford University climate economist who wrote the 2015 study, says this new research's finding that the economic damage ahead is locked in and large “makes a lot of sense.”
Burke, who wasn't part of this study, said he has some issues with some of the technical calculations “so I wouldn't put a ton of weight on their specific numerical estimates, but I think the big picture is basically right.”
The conclusions are on the high end compared to other recent studies. But since climate change goes for a long time and economic damage from higher temperatures keep compounding, they “add up to very large numbers,"" says University of California Davis economist and environmental studies professor Frances Moore, who wasn't part of the study.
That's why fighting climate change clearly passes economists' tests of costs versus benefits, she says."
2481,real,INSTITUTIONAL_AND_MEDIA_DISTRUST_PUBLIC_INSTITUTIONS,2024-06-02,"With official results yet to be announced, Serbia's president and SNS party leader Aleksandar Vucic claimed a commanding victory in the capital and almost all other municipalities around the country where votes were held.
The SNS had narrowly won the December vote with 49 seats in the city council but was unable to form a municipal government, prompting a new election.
""We had a majority even after December 17 in Belgrade. But we felt that wasn't enough legitimacy because some others didn't want to form a coalition with us. Now, we will have 62 or 63 seats"" out of 110 on the city council, Vucic said on Sunday.
Shortly after Vucic's speech, fireworks resounded in the capital.
According to preliminary results based on exit polls published by the Center for Free Elections and Democracy (CeSID) and Ipsos, the SNS came out on top with 53 percent of the vote in Belgrade followed by Kreni Promeni (""Go for Change""), a newcomer to the opposition, with 17 percent of the vote.
Turnout, meanwhile, was lower than in December -- two hours before the polls closed at 6:00 pm (1600 GMT), 37 percent of voters in the capital had cast their ballots, compared with over 45 percent in December, according to the only official turnout figures published that day.
Unlike last year's elections, SNS was pitted against a divided opposition, with some boycotting the vote while others tried to attract voters. Savo Manojlovic, leader of Go For Change and its Belgrade mayoral candidate, expressed satisfaction with the results, but added: ""We have nothing to celebrate in a country with such electoral conditions.""
""This is a great success for these people, all the supervisors, candidates, and supporters who stood by us in impossible conditions with a budget where we didn't have a single billboard"", Manojlovic said.
Irregularities reported
Local NGOs CRTA and CeSID, observing the voting on Sunday, reported dozens of irregularities, including vote-buying or double registration of voters.
The observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will share their initial report on the vote Monday morning.
Opposition activists on social media accused the SNS of organizing a call centre to buy votes in Novi Sad, Serbia's second largest city.
Local media reported that when activists tried to enter the building, clashes broke out and tear gas was used.
International observers at December's polls, including ones from the OSCE's ODIHR democratic institutions division and the European Union, alleged irregularities including vote-buying and ballot-stuffing.
The claims fuelled weeks of protest rallies outside government offices.
Serbia's top court rejected an opposition move to have the vote annulled.
'National survival'
Vucic has pushed an ultra-nationalist message to rally the SNS base, incensed by a UN General Assembly vote last month to establish an annual day of remembrance for the 1995 Srebrenica genocide.
The president himself attended the vote in New York, draped in a Serbian flag to denounce a resolution he said would ""open old wounds"" and ""create complete political havoc"".
To combat potential fraud, legislation supported by the opposition was passed in May that prohibits anyone who has moved in the last year from voting in their new constituency.
That followed allegations made in December that Serbs from neighbouring Bosnia had been bussed into Belgrade to cast ballots illegally.
The controversy over December's vote appeared to have limited campaigning and public interest in the elections.
""I saw more calls to boycott the elections than to participate in them,"" Dimitrije Secujski, a student from Belgrade, told AFP after voting.
During campaigning, ""I didn't notice any action like there was for the previous elections in December.""

3502,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-09-19,"Overdose deaths have continued to drop, now at their lowest level in 3 years, data shows
However, overdose deaths remain higher than pre-pandemic levels.
The estimated number of drug overdose deaths in the U.S. have been dropping for months and are now at their lowest levels in three years, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Deaths from overdoses dropped for the first time in five years in 2023, following a steady rise during the pandemic. However, the current number of overdose deaths still remains higher than pre-pandemic levels.
In April 2024, the latest month with data, the estimated number of deaths in the past 12 months was 101,168, according to the CDC. The last month with figures that low was in May of 2021, with 100,997 deaths.
Data from other sources, such as emergency department visits and calls to EMS, support the downward trend, according to an analysis led by Dr. Nabarun Dasgupta, a senior scientist at the Injury Prevention Research Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He tells ABC News that the data may point to 20,000 fewer deaths annually, or more.
While experts continue to explore possible reasons driving the decline, there are a few public health initiatives to curb drug overdoses that may be showing signs of success.
“Enhanced access to naloxone, expanded treatment programs for opioid use disorder, and increased public awareness about the dangers of synthetic opioids like fentanyl are likely playing significant roles in saving lives,” said Dr. John Brownstein, chief innovation officer at Boston Children’s Hospital and an ABC News medical contributor.
Another potential explanation for the downturn, Dasgupta says, may be related to changes in the drug supply, such as more people using xylazine, a dangerous, non-opioid animal sedative that's often mixed with other illicit drugs, including fentanyl.
“Xylazine makes people use less fentanyl, is the bottom line,” Dasgupta told ABC News, while citing research that showed that those who overdosed and tested positive for xylazine had less severe health outcomes than those who did not have xylazine in their system. This could be due to the fact that those who used illicit substances, like fentanyl, mixed with xylazine may be using those substances less often, Dasgupta said.
“We're seeing this pattern kind of happening that looks a lot like a change in the drug supply, more so than just explained by all the interventions in the public health space,” Dasgupta added. “It's probably a mix of all these things at the end of the day, but something really changed in the third quarter of last year.”
Within each state, however, the decline in overdose deaths is not uniform among all people. Maryland, for example, experienced a decline in deaths among white populations, yet an increase among Black populations, Dasgupta points out.
Changes in drug overdose deaths also vary greatly by state, with some still experiencing increases in the past 12 months, CDC data shows. States with the greatest dips in overdose deaths over the past year, according to the same data, were Nebraska, North Carolina, Vermont, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, in that descending order.
While the national downward trend may continue, experts told ABC News it may not be permanent.
“We've seen dips that have been erased a year later. So, I'm cautious. I feel like things really haven't cooled down yet,” Dasgupta said. “It feels like we've put the lid on the pot, but we're still at a rolling boil. There's still a lot of people dying of overdose.”
“It's crucial that we continue to intensify our efforts to address the root causes of the opioid epidemic,” Brownstein said. “We need to continue investing in comprehensive strategies that address the complex factors driving the opioid crisis.”

5198,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-11-07,"America’s military veterans make up about 6% of the adult population but account for about 20% of all suicides. That means that each day, about 18 veterans will die by suicide.
In the U.S., the overall rate of suicide has largely increased since the start of the millennium, but veterans are disproportionately represented among this tragic trend.
Each of these losses affects not only the individual but also their families, friends and co-workers. Thus, working to prevent suicide and its underlying causes is important not only to protect our loved ones but also to foster happier, safer communities.
We are a team of researchers at Arizona State University’s Center for Violence Prevention and Community Safety. We manage the Arizona Violent Death Reporting System, a surveillance system sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and part of the larger national surveillance system that operates in all U.S. states, Puerto Rico and Washington. We gather information on suicides through agreements with the Arizona Department of Health Services, medical examiners and law enforcement.
Assessing risk amid uncertainty
Military veterans range from 18 years of age to more than 100, include both men and women, and represent diverse races and ethnicities. As of 2018, the largest veteran cohort were those who served during the Vietnam War, followed by those who served during peacetime only, the Gulf War and post-9/11 conflicts.
Identifying the true risk of veteran suicide, especially relative to the general population, is a surprisingly difficult task. In past decades, researchers and stakeholders debated about which figures were most accurate, those showing veterans at increased risk or those showing the opposite. Such debates often stemmed from methodological factors.
However, mounting evidence shows that veterans need targeted suicide prevention services, and our data backs this up. From 2015 to 2022, the age-adjusted suicide rates among male veterans in Arizona outpaced those of nonveterans by a factor of 1.49 to 1.88. Put another way, while veterans in Arizona made up only 8.4% of the population in 2022, they represented 20.3% of the state’s suicides, meaning veterans were 2.5 times more likely to die by suicide.
While these numbers stem from Arizona, they also reflect the national trends showing greater and growing rates of suicide among veterans.
Why are veterans at greater risk?
One reason is that, compared to nonveterans, a greater proportion of veterans are white, male and older – demographic categories with elevated rates of suicide in the general population. For example, in Arizona, about 97% of veteran suicides between 2015 and 2022 were men, compared with 75% in the comparable nonveteran population.
Other explanations relate to veteran-specific factors. Some argue that military training and combat exposure can reduce a person’s fear of pain or death, putting suicidal veterans at greater risk of completing suicide. Military training also familiarizes a person with the use of firearms, a particularly lethal means of suicide. Statistics show that veterans, including female veterans, die by suicide using firearms more so than the general population. This tendency to use firearms as the method of suicide leads to more fatal suicide attempts.
At the Arizona Violent Death Reporting System, we collect data on circumstances that precede and may have contributed to suicide, which can help identify risk factors. While we’ve found that veterans often exhibit fewer such factors overall, certain demographic categories do display risk factors.
For example, a higher proportion of veterans ages 18 to 54 had a diagnosed mental health problem – primarily post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. In addition, more male veterans ages 65 and older had physical health problems that contributed to their suicide compared with similar nonveterans.
This highlights the need to encourage veterans to share their mental or physical health struggles with others, which will prevent veterans from struggling alone. Large-scale initiatives are trying to tackle this issue, but we can also raise awareness and reduce stigma around suicide on a local level.
Shining a light on the problem
In 1999, then-Surgeon General Dr. David Satcher highlighted suicide as a serious public health crisis, paving the way for tackling the monumental issue on a national scale.
Now, 25 years later, the U.S. government continues to emphasize the increasingly dire situation. Most recently, the Biden administration released a 2024 national strategy aimed at establishing strategic directions for improving mental health treatment and reducing suicide.
Historically, health care facilities operated by the Veterans Health Administration have been a central resource for veterans experiencing mental or physical problems. This continues to be true: While the overall population of veterans is decreasing, the number of veterans who seek resources from the organization has increased. Encounters between veterans and the Veterans Health Administration offer opportunities to screen for suicide risk and offer resources for those in need.
Crisis lines are a potentially effective means of prevention. For example, the Veterans Crisis Line has been shown to reduce a caller’s immediate distress and suicidality. Many callers have found the crisis line helpful, with responders providing both effective intervention and compassionate support.
Education and policy provide another means of suicide prevention. As firearms are a particularly lethal means of suicide, a great deal of research funding has gone toward understanding their role in suicide. Studies generally find that reducing access to guns is associated with reduced suicide rates. As a result, both general and veteran-specific suicide prevention efforts highlight the importance of handling guns safely and storing them securely.
If you know a military veteran, keep an eye out for warning signs of mental distress, which may display in a person’s words, feelings or behavior.
For example, they may display intense anxiety, agitation or desperation, or express a sense of hopelessness. Veterans diagnosed with depressive syndrome, PTSD or both may be at greater risk.
For a person who is considering suicide, even the slightest hope can mean the difference between life and death.
If you or someone you know is experiencing signs of crisis, the free and confidential 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline is available to call, text or chat.
If you are a veteran and would like to speak with responders trained to understand your unique circumstances, call 988 and then press 1."
5638,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-11-13,"Outgoing Secretary of State Antony Blinken began a farewell visit to the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Brussels, Belgium, on Wednesday in which he repeatedly insisted that President Joe Biden would “push every dollar out the door that we have at our disposal” to Ukraine.
Blinken met with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and Ukraine’s newly minted foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, asserting that the Biden’s administration secured $8 billion in Ukraine spending in September and would continue to find way to supply Ukraine with “the air defenses it needs, that has the artillery it needs, that has the armored vehicles it needs” to fight Russia.
Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 shortly after Biden lifted sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which would have dramatically increased Russian natural gas exports to western Europe, particularly Germany. President-elect Donald Trump sanctioned the pipeline project during his first term as a means of depriving Russian strongman of the funds necessary to conduct more belligerent activity in eastern Europe; Putin initially invaded Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula and colonized it in 2014. Biden’s move to rescind the sanctions prompted shock and condemnation in Kyiv, where President Volodymyr Zelensky declared himself “very unpleasantly surprised” by the news.
Biden has supported the funding of the Ukrainian military since the full-scale invasion to the tune of tens of billions of dollars, but has done little to support negotiations with the aim of ending the conflict. Trump, in contrast, vowed to end the fighting as soon as possible to prevent the further destruction of the Ukrainian state. Zelensky enthusiastically welcomed the news last week that Trump would return to office and was among the first world leaders to congratulate him and speak to him directly following the election.
Blinken, during his appearance in Brussels, emphasized that the Biden administration would work to get as much money “out the door” to bankroll the Ukrainian war effort as possible before Inauguration Day.
“The purpose of this visit is to focus our efforts on ensuring that Ukraine has the money, the munitions, and the mobilized forces to fight effectively in 2025 or to be able to negotiate a peace from a position of strength,” Blinken told reporters.
“We’ve obligated just recently and pushed out the door another $8 billion in security assistance for Ukraine – that was in September, another almost half a billion dollars just a few weeks ago,” he explained, “and President Biden has committed to making sure that every dollar we have at our disposal will be pushed out the door between now and January 20th.”
“We’re making sure that Ukraine has the air defenses it needs, that has the artillery it needs, that has the armored vehicles it needs,” he insisted.
“The President is determined that we push every dollar out the door that we have at our disposal,” he repeated, “notably from the $61 billion supplemental that was passed on a bipartisan basis by Congress some months ago, and we’re on track to do exactly that.”
Blinken nonetheless warned that it was a time “for everyone to do more,” suggesting that the largess out of the Biden administration may soon come to an end.
In a joint press conference with Sybiha, the Ukrainian foreign minister, Blinken again stated that “everyone is focused on making sure that Ukraine has what it needs” for the war.
Sybiha raised the issue of the presidential transition, stating that part of his reason for meeting with Blinken was to ensure continued support from Washington to Kyiv.
“We maintain contact with both parties and work both with the President-elect and his team and also with the outgoing administration,” he assured.
Biden’s National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan announced this weekend that Biden was planning to spend $6 billion appropriated to be spent for Ukraine before January, hinting that Trump’s inauguration may herald in a less generous era in Ukraine spending.
Throughout the presidential campaign, Trump identified the Ukraine issue as a major priority for a potential second term and vowed to end the conflict as quickly as possible. The president-elect repeatedly lamented the scale of humanitarian and cultural destruction in Ukraine.
“I want to get Russia to settle up with Ukraine and stop this — millions of people being killed, far greater than the number you read about,” Trump said during an interview in September. “But I want to get that done before I even take office, I want to get that done as president-elect, because it has to be solved — too many people dying, too many cities are just in rubble right now, you look at the cultures just being destroyed.”
Speaking to Breitbart News in August, Trump noted the severe damage to Ukraine’s cultural heritage as a result of the invasion.
“You look at the heritage of the country—the cities are mostly knocked down,” Trump said, describing Ukraine. “They’re flattened. They’re just totally flattened. Have you ever seen some of these cities? There’s not a building standing. The country has been devastated. So I want to get it solved and I will be able to get it solved. And I’d like to do it before I get to the White House after I’m president-elect.”
As president, Trump caused some anxiety in Brussels by repeatedly demanding that other members of the NATO alliance pay their fair share in defense spending. In 2018, a prescient Trump condemned Germany for funding the Russia war effort through fossil fuel purchases – “What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy?” – and demanding more robust spending commitments.
“Why are there only five out of 29 countries that have met their commitment?” Trump asked at the time in a social media message. “The U.S. is paying for Europe’s protection, then loses billions on trade. Must pay 2% of GDP IMMEDIATELY, not by 2025.”
In August, Trump clarified that he would resume his demands for more spending from NATO allies.
“I’ll also get you reinforcement for allies abroad, making them pull their weight,” Trump told the National Guard Association of the United States. “They have to do that, and they have to pay their fair share. As I was saying for years, all of these NATO countries spent far less than two percent of GDP on their militaries, leaving our forces overstretched.”
“To make up for shortfalls and help deter threats I’ll insist that every NATO nation must spend at least three percent,” Trump promised. “You have to go up to three percent, two percent is the steal of the century.”

2395,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-04-03,"CDC closely monitoring cases of bird flu, taking animal to human case seriously: CDC director
Officials have been ""preparing for it [in humans] for 20 years.""
Although still confident the risks of avian flu to the human population are low, Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told ABC News they are taking seriously dairy cows being infected in at least 11 farms and, most recently, a human dairy farmer in Texas.
Public health officials have been ""working on avian flu and preparing for it [in humans] for 20 years,"" Cohen said. ""We've invested in our ability to test for it, to prevent it, to treat it.""
""These are the things that reassure me: 20 years of preparation, no genetic changes to this virus, no human-to-human spread and nothing in the virus in terms of adaptations that would make us think it is more adaptive to human spread,"" she said.
Cohen said the human who contracted avian flu, discovered last week in Texas, works with dairy cows. They ""had mild symptoms; they're doing well and recovering,"" she added.
Cohen went on to say that the CDC and the U.S. government were ""taking this situation very seriously and closely monitoring it."" The federal agency is working with local health departments, state health departments and the U.S. Department of Agriculture and has, over the last two decades, invested in the ability to prevent and treat the disease, Cohen explained.
There is still no evidence of human-to-human transmission of bird flu, called H5N1, within the United States, she said. The latest evidence shows the virus did not adapt to infect a human.
The fact that the virus does not appear to be passing from person to person is one reason that the CDC feels confident that, at this moment, the risk to the public is low.
Cohen said current tests and treatments still work, and, if needed, there is a capacity to increase manufacturing of Tamiflu, an antiviral medication, millions of doses of which are in the national stockpile. Additionally, vaccines could be developed in an accelerated timeline, she said.
She dismissed any comparison to the COVID-19 pandemic for reasons including the fact that avian flu is not a new virus, medications already exist to treat it, there is no evidence of human-to-human spread and no evidence of the virus having mutated.
While the sick person in Texas was presumed to have been infected by a cow, it remains possible that a bird was also the culprit as both cows and birds were sick and present on the farm, according to Cohen. Local health departments are set to test symptomatic individuals exposed to infected livestock.
Infection can occur between animals and humans due to the virus getting into a person’s eyes, nose, mouth, or if inhaled, according to the CDC. Respiratory transmission in close proximity is believed to be the most likely way the virus is passed on. People who are in close proximity to infected animals may be at greater risk of infection.
There are currently 11 dairy herds with confirmed positive cases in cattle, according to the USDA. This includes seven in Texas, two in Kansas, one in Michigan and one in New Mexico."

Heart disease is the #1 killer in the modern world. It's the reason why millions pop aspirin, blood pressure, or statin drugs daily in the hopes that they might reduce the risk of a sudden and premature death. But pharmaceutical approaches to prevention carry with them such profound health risks that, in most cases, the jury is still out as to whether they do more good than harm. Here at GreenMedInfo.health, we have a strong belief (and therefore bias) that natural substances are superior to synthetic ones in preventing and treating health problems. We also focus on bringing to light research on the unintended, adverse effects of these commonly employed pharmaceutical interventions, as they are underreported in popular media. That said, as an ""evidence-based"" platform we make a concerted effort to defer to the authority of peer-reviewed and published scientific literature, which when closely inspected, lends remarkably consistent support to our core advocacies. You can view literally thousands of studies we have gathered on natural ways to prevent and sometimes reverse heart disease via our newly redesigned Research Dashboard by searching any number of over 10,000 categories, from arterial calcification to high blood pressure to heart attack.
Why The Drugs (Patented Chemicals) Won't Work
A quick word about commonly ingested and putatively heart-friendly drugs for the primary prevention of heart disease…
First, let's acknowledge that heart disease is not caused by a lack of a drug. This point is so obvious that it often seems to escape the attention it deserves. To the contrary, it is exposure to tens of thousands of chemicals (many of them drugs) that did not pre-exist the industrial revolution in the late 19th century that is one of the major, if not the primary reason why we have a heart disease epidemic. Of course, nutritional and lifestyle factors (e.g. smoking) play a huge role, but being exposed to chemicals and drugs that shouldn't be in the body (outside their occasional use in emergency medicine where they can be life-saving) is a sorely underreported part of the puzzle.
Aspirin, for instance, has been linked to over 50 serious side effects, the top 7 of which we documented in our previous report, The Evidence Against Aspirin and For Natural Alternatives. Statin drugs are even worse. Not only are the statistics manipulated to make them seem far more effective than they actually are, but we have identified over 300 adverse health effects linked to their use. Should we be surprised? The body is comprised, molecule by molecule, cell by cell, of natural substances not synthetic ones. Therefore what's not natural is perceived by the body as xenobiotic (""foreign to life""), rejected if possible, but almost always leadsing to a wide range of adverse effects that are at the root of many health conditions that are, in turn, treated with more chemicals to suppress or mask the symptoms of chemical poisoning. It's a truly vicious cycle. Some call it the medical merry-go-round.
Why Garlic May Save Your Heart (And Your Life)
Given the uncertainty that comes with taking pharmaceuticals -- basically patented chemicals, ostensibly to ""improve health"" or ""reduce disease risks"" -- natural alternatives are receiving far greater attention today than ever before. And rightfully so! Literally thousands of years of cross-culturally confirmed positive experience is backing their use, including a glut of relatively recently performed scientific research.
We've looked at a wide range of natural alternatives to drugs for heart disease in previous posts, with pomegranate, turmeric, and sesame seed demonstrating extraordinary cardioprotective properties, to name but a few. Garlic, however, may be the most compelling of them all from the standpoint of clinical research, given that numerous recent studies now show this amazing herb can prevent and even reverse the accumulation of calcified plaque in the arteries. This is, of course, the goal of root-cause resolution medicine: to address and ameliorate the underlying pathologies, instead of simply suppressing symptoms or surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease risk such as LDL cholesterol. Take a look at one of our previous reports on the topic of garlic's artery de-calcifying properties here.
The most recent clinical study on the topic of garlic's heart-disease healing properties was just published in the journal Nutrition and entitled, ""Aged Garlic Extract Reduces Low Attenuation Plaque in Coronary Arteries of Patients with Metabolic Syndrome in a Prospective Randomized Double-Blind Study."" It looked at whether or not aged garlic supplementation could reduce the volume of so-called low-attenuation plaque in the arteries of patients suffering from metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome includes a constellation of health problems, including high blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol levels. This condition greatly increases the person's risk for heart attack and stroke, and often occurs alongside atherosclerosis.
Although several previous studies have demonstrated that aged garlic extract (AGE) inhibits the progression of coronary artery calcification, its effect on noncalcified plaque (NCP) has not been clearly demonstrated to be effective in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
The new study involved 55 patients with metabolic syndrome, with an average age of 58.7 and 71% men. They were divided into two groups (27 orally administered with 2400 mg a day of aged garlic) and 28 placebo. The intervention lasted an average of 354 days.
The patients were maintained on current medications such as aspirin, hypertensive, or hyperlipidemia medication, and did not change medications during the study period.
The results showed a significant decrease in low-attenuation plaque volume (-1.5% ± 2.3%), compared with an increase of 0.2% ± 2.0%, in the placebo group. Low-attenuation plaque is associated with ischemia risk (inhibited blood supply) in atherosclerosis, a factor in poorer prognosis.
The clear conclusion of the study was that aged garlic prevented plaque buildup in the arteries. When compared to the increase in plaque volume in the untreated group, clearly the intervention has life-saving implications in that it actually reversed the progression of atherosclerosis.
How does garlic work?
The researchers surmised that garlic possesses a number of therapeutic properties that occur simultaneously to stabilize atherosclerosis. Those primary properties are:
When you consider the diverse ways in which garlic expresses its cardioprotective actions, it is what you could call a ""poly pill."" For decades the pharmaceutical industry has been trying to reproduce the spectrum of benefits witnessed in natural substances with a patented chemical capable of doing the same thing. The industry has clearly failed. In fact, drugs like statins carry over 300 distinct risks for adverse effects. You can view the statin database on our website to see the evidence for this astounding evidence of its toxicity.
We have additional research on our garlic database which reveals the cardioprotective properties of this remarkable herb. We have created a public page for 16 studies on the topic here, as part of our professional membership tool set functionality called ""create public page."" [Learn more about Professional features here]
Garlic is a powerful, time-tested, safe, affordable and easily accessible natural healing agent with dozens of documented side benefits. Those on medication, such as a blood thinner, should be mindful not to take it in ""nutraceutical"" concentrations without the guidance of a trained medical professional. For those who have opted out of conventional, drug-based approaches we can only opine that the best thing would be to let your food, and herbs like garlic, be your medicine, if you so choose to exercise your free will.

More people than perhaps even realize it themselves are being experimented on as part of what they call “modern medicine.” And in a new article, author Roman Bystrianyk unpacks the sordid history of Stanley “Godfather of Vaccines” Plotkin, a renowned physician who admitted that the sick, orphans, the mentally handicapped, and babies of imprisoned mothers have all been experimented on throughout history in order to create new vaccines.
Back in the 1960s when he was completing a pediatric residency in London, Plotkin observed while at the Hospital for Sick Children (now known as the Great Ormond Street Hospital) and admitted to such in a 2018 court case that society’s most vulnerable were being preyed upon so Big Pharma could develop new high-profit injectable drugs for the masses.
An American physician, Plotkin in his now-“retirement” works as a consultant for the “big four” vaccine manufacturers. He also consults with biotechnology firms, non-profit organizations and governments about how to push more vaccines on people.
When asked about his infamous “Godfather of Vaccines” nickname, Plotkin said he does not necessarily prefer the name, but if people want to call him that then they can.
“I think it’s ambiguous since the Godfather was a criminal,” Plotkin retorted. “I wouldn’t [call myself that], but obviously I can’t stop others.”
(Related: Remember when Ivanka Trump admitted that her father, who repeatedly referred to himself as the “father of the vaccine” during COVID, partnered with Moderna to produce mRNA injections before the launch of Operation Warp Speed?)
Plotkin is an important figure in the vaccine industry, even if his name does not ring a bell in your mind. He is one of the first people that the world’s movers and shakers went to after the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) appeared out of nowhere to consult with him about how mRNA (modRNA) injections should be marketed.
“The medical establishment sees you as part of an unending experiment, a subject for trial in an array of medications and vaccines – without ever being fully informed of the potential dangers,” Bystrianyk wrote. “You likely trust that these products are meticulously tested, believing corporations and governments would never risk your well-being. But history tells a different story.”
One of the primary examples Bystrianyk provides in his piece is the combination DTP (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis) vaccine, which has been in use since the late 1940s in the United States and since around 1957 in England.
The DTP shot was problematic from the very beginning, Bystrianyk says. In the 1940s, twin boys died after receiving their second injection of the multivalent vaccine. The DTP shot was also discovered to cause brain damage, seizures and other problems in tests.
“The 1985 IOM [Institute of Medicine] report of the US National Academy of Sciences reported on the problem of adverse reactions to the whole-cell pertussis vaccine,” Bystrianyk writes.
“The panel estimated that 17,994,600 doses of whole-cell vaccine were given each year. The result was 7,197,840 cases of minor reactions, 10,283 convulsions, 164 cases of encephalitis and 58 cases of chronic disability, with costs running into the millions. The panel also estimated that the whole-cell DTP caused two to four deaths per year.”
In that same 2018 testimony in a Michigan court, Plotkin admitted that deadly DTP injections had been given to vulnerable people groups all throughout Latin America and Africa as part of Big Pharma clinical trials. This was done despite the fact that the shots were linked to a 10-fold increased death rate among those who took it.
“I wonder how much of my recurring ear infections and other childhood illnesses were caused by their so-called ‘vaccines,'” one commenter wrote, lamenting the vaccine damage that he received as a child.
“It’s hard to tell since they poisoned almost everyone and sick children became the new normal. But they are not going to continue this crap on me as an adult.”

Russia and Ukraine have swapped 95 prisoners of war each, in their latest exchange deal.
According to Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for POWs, some of those who were released on Wednesday had spent more than two years in captivity. They were captured in Mariupol, during Russia’s early offensive in the Kyiv region.
It also confirmed that just over 3,400 people, both civilians and military, have returned from Russian captivity since the outbreak of the war.
Zelenskyy said in a post on the Telegram messaging service that the United Arab Emirates had again brokered the agreements. The UAE has said it maintains friendly relations with both Moscow and Kyiv.
Zelenskyy posted photos of mostly gaunt servicemen with shaven heads and wrapped in Ukrainian flags standing in what appeared to be an open area of countryside.
“No matter how difficult it may be, we are looking for everyone who may be in captivity. We have to return everyone,” he wrote.
The Russian Defense Ministry said the freed Russian soldiers will be flown to Moscow for medical treatment and rehabilitation.
The prisoner swap was the 54th since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of neighbouring Ukraine back in February 2022.
Officials from the warring countries meet only when they swap the dead and POWs, after lengthy preparation and diplomacy.
Neither Ukraine nor Russia are disclosing how many prisoners are being held in total."

Millions of American children these days are being bombarded day in and day out with LGBT perversion at school, in media and online. Many of these kids end up believing the lies they are told by their teachers, politicians and Hollywood actors about the gender ""spectrum,"" prompting them to lob off body parts and take hormone-destroying pharmaceuticals in order to become their ""true selves.""
After analyzing insurance claims filed nationwide, Do No Harm found that 5,747 unique patients received gender-affirming surgery, which includes things like mastectomies and genital reassignment. A whopping 8,519 minors were prescribed puberty blockers and / or hormone replacement therapy during this same time period, which all in all saw more than 60,000 total prescriptions written for LGBT transitioning drugs.
The total amount of all insurance claims filed between 2019 and 2023 for ""gender-affirming care"" was found to be $119 million. Do No Harm put together a searchable database that parents can use to see what more than 225 hospitals across the country have been doing to underage youth in recent years.
(Related: Did you know that Kamala Harris is a proud supporter and promoter of transgender child mutilation and degenerate LGBT perversion?)

Keep in mind that Do No Harm's researchers were extremely conservative in their estimates. Chances are that there are many more children out there whose bodies have been destroyed by LGBT transitioning procedures and drugging that were not captured in the research.
""We've really been meticulous in trying to make sure that the data are as clear as possible and are as accurate as possible,"" said Dr. Stanley Goldfarb, Do No Harm's chairman.
Many of them may not feel this way now, but LGBT mutilation is something that the vast majority of transgenders will come to regret, especially if they ""transitioned"" while underage.
""The eugenicists, neo-Malthusians, nihilists, and ecofreaks are jumping up and down as they achieve their mission to eliminate the human race and stop people from reproducing,"" one commenter wrote about this modern-day horror show.
""Those who push this on children should be jailed,"" wrote another. ""It's even worse than grooming alone and people like Pete Buttigieg and his 'husband' would likely do such things to their two adopted children / victims. Those children never had a chance at a normal life.""

[EPA-EFE/YURI KOCHETKOV] Euractiv is part of the Trust Project >>> Languages: BulgarianPrint Email Facebook X LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram The Pentagon said on Monday (24 June) that Ukraine makes its own targeting decisions after the Kremlin directly blamed the United States for an attack on Crimea that it said was carried out with US-supplied ATACMS missiles and that killed at least four people and injured 151. The war in Ukraine has triggered the biggest confrontation between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, and Russian officials have said that the conflict is entering the most dangerous escalatory phase to date. But directly blaming the United States for a deadly attack on Crimea – which Russia annexed in 2014 and now considers to be Russian territory although most of the world considers it to be part of Ukraine – is a step further. “Ukraine makes its own targeting decisions and conducts its own military operations,” Major Charlie Dietz, a Pentagon spokesperson, said. A White House National Security Council spokesperson said any loss of civilian life was a tragedy. “That certainly includes the thousands of innocent Ukrainians who have been killed by Russian forces since this Russian war of aggression began,” the spokesperson said. At least two children were killed in the attack on Sevastopol on Sunday, according to Russian officials. Video showed people running from a beach near Sevastopol and some of the injured being carried off on sun loungers. Russia said the United States had supplied the weapons, while US military specialists had aimed the weapons and provided data for them. Ukraine can use US-supplied weapons to hit Russian forces that are firing on Ukrainian troops anywhere across the border into Russia and not just in Russian territory near Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, the Pentagon said on 20 June.

Russia summoned US Ambassador Lynne Tracy to the foreign ministry where she faced accusations that Washington was “waging a hybrid war against Russia and has actually become a party to the conflict”. The attack, Russia told Tracy, would “not go unpunished.

3496,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-08-12,"More than half of US states reporting 'very high' COVID activity levels: CDC
At least 27 states are reporting ""very high"" levels, wastewater data shows.
More than half of U.S. states are reporting ""very high"" levels of COVID activity as the virus continues to spread and increase in many parts of the country, according to the latest wastewater data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
At least 27 states are reporting ""very high"" levels and 17 states are reporting ""high"" levels of wastewater viral activity.
The western region continues to see the highest levels followed by the South, Midwest and Northeast, respectively.
Current levels are nearing but remain lower than what they were in the winter months, when there tends to be increased spread of respiratory illnesses.
Wastewater data comes with limitations in how well it represents spread in a community, but it may be the best data available, experts say.
""While wastewater is not a perfect measure, it's increasingly vital in filling the gaps left by the absence of comprehensive case reporting and hospitalization data,"" said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist and chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor.
Many national surveillance systems have diminished in scope since the national public health emergency ended, leaving authorities will limited resources to monitor how the virus is spreading.
""As traditional surveillance systems have dwindled, wastewater analysis has emerged as one of the most reliable tools we have to monitor COVID-19 activity in communities,"" Brownstein added.
Other limited COVID surveillance systems such as emergency department visits and test positivity are also on the rise, according to CDC data. Deaths from the virus remain relatively flat, especially compared to previous years.
Updated COVID vaccines are set to be available this fall, according to federal health authorities. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended that vaccine manufacturers formulate shots based on the KP.2 strain, an offshoot of the omicron variant that is currently estimated to make up about 6% of cases.
Genetically similar variants, known as KP.3.1.1 and KP.3, currently make up almost half of estimated cases, CDC data shows.
The CDC has already recommended that everyone over the age of 6 months get an updated COVID vaccine this season. The recommendation will take effect as soon as the vaccines are made available, pending FDA authorization.
An expected delivery date for the updated COVID vaccines has not been shared yet, but in previous years the shot was made available in late August or September. Vaccine manufacturers have told ABC News they are ready to ship doses as soon as they receive the green light from the FDA."
5649,fake,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-11-04,"His remarks come as officials have indicated that these troops are expected to approach the frontlines in the coming weeks. When asked about the presence of North Korean soldiers already in Russia, Biden said the Ukrainian forces should hit them if they cross into their territory. (Related: U.S. says North Korea has deployed troops to support Russia in war against Ukraine.)
American intelligence agencies have suggested that North Korea has deployed around 10,000 troops, with several thousand already moving toward Russia's Kursk region, an area where Ukrainian forces are currently engaged in conflict with Russian troops.
According to U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) spokesperson Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder, a small number of these troops are already in the region, with the rest undergoing training in eastern North Korea, anticipated to be deployed soon for combat operations.
Ryder echoed U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s assessment that Russia's decision to welcome North Korean forces reflects a dire situation regarding its manpower and operational capacity. This was further highlighted during a recent discussion between National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Andriy Yermak, head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, confirming the U.S.'s commitment to supporting Ukraine.
The potential deployment of North Korean soldiers has raised alarms, especially after reports indicated that these troops were not only on Russian soil but actively participating in combat in western regions adjacent to Ukraine.
South Korea's National Intelligence Service has long warned of North Korea's preparations to send military personnel, including fighter pilots, with estimates suggesting over 12,000 could arrive by year's end.
While both Moscow and Pyongyang have dismissed these reports as ""fake news,"" intelligence sources connected to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have confirmed the presence of North Korean troops in the Kursk region, categorizing it as a significant escalation in North Korea's involvement in the conflict.
NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte described this development as a threat to global security and a violation of international law, linking it to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s increasing desperation amid heavy losses.
The DoD reaffirmed the intelligence on North Korean troops, indicating they could soon engage in combat against Ukraine. Deputy Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh expressed concerns about their potential role in bolstering Russian operations.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been proactive in addressing this issue, discussing the situation with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and emphasizing that the conflict is evolving into a broader international struggle. He noted that the arrival of North Korean troops could force Ukraine to confront them directly on European soil.
As the Kremlin prepared for meetings with North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui, Zelensky warned that this could lead to a direct conflict between Ukraine and North Korea. The Pentagon has made it clear that should North Korean forces engage in battle, there would be no limitations on Ukraine's use of U.S. weapons against them.
This unfolding situation raises questions about North Korea's motives for sending troops. While North Korea is often accused of providing military support to Russia, analysts suggest that the regime could be seeking advanced military technology and strategic advantages in return.
North Korea's military collaboration with Russia, especially following the signing of a mutual defense pact, indicates a strengthening alliance that could yield benefits for both parties. Observers note that North Korea might gain access to critical military technology, enhancing its capabilities and providing battlefield experience for its troops, which could be valuable if tensions rise on the Korean Peninsula.
However, experts warn that North Korean soldiers may face challenges in adapting to the Russian military environment, given their lack of combat experience and potential language barriers. While Ukraine has attempted to appeal to these soldiers to defect, promising better conditions, the reality of strict monitoring and the risk of severe repercussions for surrendering could deter such actions.
As the situation continues to develop, the implications of North Korean involvement in the Ukraine conflict could reshape regional dynamics and international responses, with both Ukraine and its allies closely monitoring the evolving landscape.

5698,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-09-05,"Russia was planning to attack Ukraine from the Kursk region before Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion last month, Ukraine’s top military commander, Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskiy, said in an interview broadcast on September 5, after Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that the incursion has not affected Moscow’s special military operation.
RFE/RL's Ukraine Live Briefing gives you the latest developments on Russia's invasion, Western military aid, the plight of civilians, and territorial control maps. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.
Syrsky said in an interview with CNN that he considers the operation in Kursk a success because it reduced the threat of an enemy attack.
""We prevented them from acting. We moved the fighting to the enemy's territory so that he could feel what we feel every day,"" he said.
According to Syrskiy, Moscow has transferred tens of thousands of troops to the Kursk region, including some of its best airborne assault units.
Syrskiy also admitted that Ukraine is under significant pressure in the Pokrovsk area, but he said that Ukrainian forces have so far succeeded in stopping the Russian advance there.
""Over the past six days, the enemy has not advanced a single meter in the Pokrovsk area. In other words, our strategy is working,"" he said.
Syrskiy said that the ability of Russian forces to maneuver and deploy reinforcements from other directions has been limited and ""this weakening is undoubtedly felt in other areas.""
In recent weeks, the front line in the Donetsk region has moved closer to the strategically significant city of Pokrovsk, which in the first two years of the full-scale war was deep behind the front line.
Since its surprise incursion into Kursk, Kyiv claims to have seized control of more than 1,200 square kilometers of Russian territory, while Russian forces have pushed ahead with their effort to capture Pokrovsk.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in an interview with U.S. broadcaster NBC this week that the aim of the incursion was to accrue Russian territory and troops for future exchanges, emphasizing that Ukraine does not need Russian territory.
""Our operation is aimed at restoring our territorial integrity. We capture Russian troops to replace them with Ukrainian [ones],"" he said. ""We tell them, you know, we need our military soldiers in exchange for Russian ones. The same attitude is to the territories. We don't need their land.""
Putin, speaking on September 5 at the Eastern Eurasian Forum in Russia's Far Eastern city of Vladivostok, claimed that by sending troops into the Kursk region Ukraine had weakened its forces in its eastern Donbas region.
""The enemy's goal was to make us get nervous, mess around, move our troops from one site to another, and stop our offensive in key directions, first of all in the Donbas,"" Putin said. ""Did the enemy manage to do so? No, it managed nothing.""
Putin claimed that Russia's forces ""stabilized the situation and started gradually pushing the enemy from the territories along the border."" The move left Ukraine without the means to ""contain our offensive"" in eastern Ukraine, Putin said.
""To the contrary, by sending its sufficiently big and well-trained units to the border districts, the enemy weakened itself on key fronts, while our troops have expedited their offensive operations,"" he said.
Putin has previously called the Ukrainian incursion ""a provocation"" and publicly said it left Russia with no reason to negotiate with Kyiv. He backtracked from that position on September 5, saying that ""we never refused to hold negotiations."" However, he said in Vladivostok that any peace talks must take into account Moscow's long-standing conditions -- that parts of Ukraine occupied by Russian troops must remain under Moscow's control. Kyiv has rejected these conditions.
Putin also hinted in Vladivostok that when talking about possible talks, Kyiv must take into consideration the future losses it faces.
""It sometimes seems to me that those who now lead Ukraine are aliens or some sort of foreigners. As a matter of fact, they simply do not think, and I am serious about this. You know, [they have] such colossal losses. What can they do further, I do not understand,"" Putin said.
Putin's statements came as Russian forces targeted the capital of Ukraine, Kyiv, with more overnight drone strikes. The Ukrainian military said that several other regions, including the northern Chernihiv and northeastern Sumy regions, were targeted by Russian drones.
In the Sumy region, the government expanded the mandatory evacuation from five towns in two districts.
Sumy Governor Volodymyr Artyukh discussed evacuation measures during a meeting in Glukhiv, one of the areas where shelling has intensified.
In view of the destruction of infrastructure and housing, the regional authorities decided to expand the list of settlements for mandatory evacuation, he said. The order now includes Glukhiv, Esman, and Svesa in the Shostkinsky district, and Manukhivka and Ivanivka in the Konotopsky district."

Alyoshina told the Novaya Gazeta Baltia newspaper on June 25 that she was threatened with being confined to a psychiatric clinic if she continued to be a woman. Born in 1990 as Roman Alyoshin, the ex-chief of the Civic Initiative political party branch in the Siberian region of Altai changed gender to female in 2020. After the Supreme Court labeled the ""international LGBT movement"" extremist, Alyoshina quit politics."
6010,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-09-24,"WASHINGTON -- At a Pennsylvania munitions factory where 155-mm artillery shells are churned out by the thousands, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy grinned and shook hands, and he signed one of the shells that the Ukrainian military is heavily dependent on.
""It is in places like this where you can truly feel that the democratic world can prevail,"" he said in a post on X, ""thanks to people like these -- in Ukraine, in America, and in all partner countries -- who work tirelessly to ensure that life is protected.""
The munitions plant was Zelenskiy's first stop on a weeklong visit to the United States, a trip shaping up to be one of the most consequential trips for the Ukrainian leader since Russia launched its all-out invasion in February 2022.
In speeches at the United Nations and meetings at the White House, Zelenskiy is hoping to rally the world to his cause fighting Europe's largest land war since World War II -- and also get permission to expand his military's ability to hit Russia more forcefully inside Russia itself.

In the United States, Americans are increasingly impatient with U.S. support for Ukraine, sentiments channeled by Donald Trump, the former president and Republican candidate in the November 5 election. And on the ground, Russian troops continue to grind forward in eastern Ukraine even as they suffer immense losses, closing in on the key cites of Pokrovsk and Vuhledar.
""It's important for Ukraine to present some kind of consistent and realistic vision on how specifically assistance from the West can help it achieve its strategic goals,"" Mikhail Alexseev, a political science professor at San Diego State University, told RFE/RL.
Global South In Focus
Zelenskiy will address the UN General Assembly in New York on September 25, where he is expected to remind the world of Russia's invasion, launched in February 2022.
Zelenskiy will need to focus his address in particular on the Global South, said Andriy Veselovskiy, Ukraine's former representative to the European Union.
That's a term that refers to the countries of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, most of which are ambivalent at best about the war, concerned more about the dangers of economic turmoil or spiking food prices. Many nations in that loose grouping view the fighting as a proxy war between the United States and Russia.
All of the 40 nations that abstained or voted against a March 2022 UN resolution condemning Russia's invasion were located in the Global South.
""Ukraine needs to avoid the separation of the West and South on the question of Ukraine,"" Veselovskiy told RFE/RL. ""We need to at least make the positions of some countries milder. We need to change the mood on the question of Ukraine.""
The Global South broadly speaking has leverage with Russia, experts said, given that the Kremlin has destroyed its relationship with the West. But right now, the mood is that Ukraine should make the effort to hold talks with the Kremlin, said Richard Gowan, the UN director for International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based research organization.
""There's a sense that it's really time for Ukraine to sit down and negotiate with Russia,"" Gowan told RFE/RL. ""There may not really be an appreciation of how difficult it would be for the Ukrainians to get a viable deal with Moscow.""
West Wing
Zelenskiy's visit to the White House on September 26 will be just as consequential, if not more so.
Despite Ukraine's daring incursion into Russia's Kursk region in August, Russian forces continue to grind forward in Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine.
Ukrainian officials have pleaded for months for not only more weaponry; Washington is the single largest supplier of arms and equipment, including the artillery shells from the Pennsylvania factory.
During his meeting with President Joe Biden, Zelenskiy will also request permission to use U.S. long-range missiles to strike military targets deep inside Russia like depots and airfields housing fighter jets.
Those jets are being used with devastating consequences by Russia, dropping heavy, guided bombs that flatten entire city blocks or obliterate Ukrainian defensive positions and are difficult to shoot down. The bombs have also heavily damaged the country's energy infrastructure.
Up to 4,000 such bombs are being dropped on eastern Ukraine each month, Zelenskiy told CNN in an interview last week.
For that reason, Ukrainian commanders want to use Western weaponry to hit Russian airfields.
Biden administration officials have so far denied Ukraine's request, fearing it would cross a red line for Russian President Vladimir Putin. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin earlier this month suggested such long-range fire would turn the tide in the war.
Alexseev said Kyiv cannot outright win in a war of attrition, but it can push back Russian troops by disrupting supply lines.
Last week, Ukraine hit two ammunition depots far beyond the front line, apparently with homemade drones. At one depot in the Tver region, up to three months of munitions may have been destroyed, according to estimates by Estonia's defense intelligence agency.
Critics of the U.S. policy have pointed out that several of the Kremlin's apparent red lines have already been crossed in the past with no repercussions.
However, Biden may be more cautious this time with the U.S. presidential election just six weeks away, experts said.
Kamala Harris, Biden's vice president, is running neck-and-neck with Trump in the election campaign, according to many polls.
Some Republicans, like Trump running mate Senator JD Vance, say the United States should not give more aid, arguing Kyiv has little chance of driving Russia out.
Other Republicans oppose it on the grounds the money could be better spent at home.
Though Ukraine is not at the top of most Americans' concerns for the election, the question has resonated with some voters, and polls have shown growing American impatience.
Victory Plan
Zelenskiy is also expected to unveil his ""victory plan"" -- a detailed road map to end the war as Ukraine sees it.
Few details of the plan have been released, though Zelenskiy administration officials have signaled they think it is realistic and achievable, so long as it gains Western backing.
""Decisive action now could hasten the just end of Russian aggression against Ukraine next year. Our victory plan will help bring Russia to peace in practice,"" Zelenskiy said after meeting with a group of Republican and Democratic senators on September 24.
""Now, at the end of the year, we have a real opportunity to strengthen cooperation between Ukraine and the United States,"" he said in a post on Telegram.
More Money, More Weapons, More Aid
Regardless of who wins the presidency and control of Congress on November 5, U.S. aid to Ukraine next year is most likely to decline from the $61 billion package passed in April, analysts said.
By how much will depend on various factors, including which party comes out on top.
Democrats would likely support a larger package than the Republicans. Harris has clearly stated she wants Ukraine to prevail in the war.
Trump, meanwhile, has dodged the question, saying only that he wants the war to end, but has given few details of how that would happen.
Zelenskiy's visit to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Pennsylvania was in part aimed at reminding lawmakers and American voters that aid to Ukraine also generates jobs in the United States, Alexseev said.
""It's obviously important to highlight that benefit as it has a broad appeal to the traditional Democratic base but also to the Republican base, since a lot of support for Trump is based on grievances about the loss of manufacturing jobs,"" he said."

The messages say that ""temporary measures"" have been imposed on conscripts in accordance with amendments to Russia's law on military duty. Other restrictions refer to a ban on driving and registering vehicles, registering and selling real estate, receiving loans, and registering as a self-employed individual or entrepreneur. Since its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has reportedly suffered massive losses on the battlefield, although Moscow does not reveal the number of its war casualties. According to Britain's Chief of the Defense Staff Tony Radakin, an average of some 1,500 Russian soldiers were killed or injured daily in October alone, making it Russia's worst month for casualties since the beginning of the war."

WASHINGTON (AP) — Relatively few Americans fully endorse the idea that a fertilized egg should have the same rights as a pregnant woman. But a significant share say it describes their views at least somewhat well, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
The new survey comes as questions grow around reproductive health access in the continued fallout from the decision by the Supreme Court to end federal abortion protections. The poll found that a solid majority of Americans oppose a federal abortion ban as a rising number support access to abortions for any reason.
But anti-abortion advocates are increasingly pushing for broader measures that would give rights and protections to embryos and fetuses, which could have massive implications for fertility treatments and other areas of health care.
The poll suggests that when it comes to more nuanced questions about issues like in vitro fertilization, or IVF — which may be affected by the restrictive climate in some states, even though they were not previously considered as part of “abortion” — there is general support for reproductive health protections. But the poll also shows some uncertainty, as Americans are faced with situations that would not have arisen before Roe v. Wade was overturned.
According to the poll, about 6 in 10 U.S. adults support protecting access to IVF, a type of fertility treatment where eggs are combined with sperm outside the body in a lab to form an embryo. Views on banning the destruction of embryos created through IVF are less developed, with 4 in 10 adults expressing a neutral opinion.
“I believe that it’s a woman’s right to determine what she wants to do with her pregnancy, and she should be cared for. There should be no question about that,” said John Evangelista, 73. “And IVF, I mean, for years, it’s saved a lot of people grief — because they want to have a child. Why would you want to limit this for people?”
Earlier this year, Alabama’s largest hospital paused in vitro fertilization treatments, following a court ruling that said frozen embryos are the legal equivalent of children. Not long after, the governor signed legislation shielding doctors from potential legal liability in order to restart procedures in the state.
But the political damage was done. Democrats routinely cite IVF concerns as part of a larger problem where women in some states are getting worse medical care since the fall of Roe. They link delayed IVF care to cases in states with abortion restrictions, where women must wait until they are very sick in order to get care. Democrats say these issues show how GOP efforts to overturn Roe have profoundly affected all facets of reproductive care.
On the other hand, protections for IVF are supported by Americans across the political spectrum: About three-quarters of Democrats and 56% of Republicans favor preserving access to IVF, while about 4 in 10 independents are in favor and just under half, 46%, neither favor nor oppose protecting access. For some, their views have been shaped by personal experience with the procedure.
“I’m about to go through IVF right now, and you’re trying to get as many embryos as you can so you can have more chances at having one live birth, or more than that, if you’re lucky,” said Alexa Voloscenko, 30. “I just don’t want people to be having more trouble to access IVF; it’s already hard enough.”
But the poll found that about 3 in 10 Americans say that the statement “human life begins at conception, so a fertilized egg is a person with the same rights as a pregnant woman” describes their views on abortion law and policy extremely or very well, while an additional 18% say it describes their views somewhat well. About half say the statement describes their views “not very well” or “not well at all.”
This view is in tension with some aspects of IVF care — in particular, fertility treatments where eggs are fertilized and develop into embryos in a lab. Sometimes, embryos are accidentally damaged or destroyed, and unused embryos may be discarded.
Republicans are about twice as likely as Democrats or independents to say that the statement about fertilized eggs having the same rights as a pregnant woman describes their views extremely or very well. About 4 in 10 Republicans say that compared with about 2 in 10 Democrats and independents.
And views are less clear overall on a more specific aspect of policy related to IVF — making it illegal to destroy embryos created during the process. One-quarter of U.S. adults somewhat or strongly favor banning the destruction of embryos created through IVF, while 4 in 10 have a neutral view and about one-third somewhat or strongly oppose it.
“Human life begins at a heartbeat,” said Steven Otey, 73, a Republican who doesn’t believe created embryos should be destroyed. “Embryos ... can become babies, we shouldn’t be destroying them.”
About 3 in 10 Republicans and roughly one-quarter of Democrats favor banning the destruction of embryos created through IVF. Four in 10 Republicans — and nearly 6 in 10 independents — have a neutral view.

5211,fake,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-11-06,"11/06/2024 / By Cassie B.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is meant to protect the health of Americans, but what happens when the person in charge is taking part in the exact type of behavior they prohibit others from engaging in?
That’s the question some people are asking about FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf, who seems surprisingly eager to promote pharmaceuticals for off-label use despite the practice being banned.
During his first stint serving as the FDA commissioner under Barack Obama’s presidency, Dr. Califf even drafted a proposal that would see pharmaceutical firms given permission to advertise their drugs for off-label use. This is something that the FDA has long prohibited, and he received quite a bit of pushback for the proposal.
For example, Senator Ed Markey sent him a letter about the off-label use of deadly opioids, warning: “The FDA must not become complicit in the growing prescription fentanyl problem this country is combating.”
In 2009, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer paid $2.3 billion for illegally marketing more than a dozen of its drugs off label. They were investigated by several federal agencies, one of which was the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations.
This was a big issue at the time, and it’s something that hasn’t gone away yet. Dangerous (and often deadly) outcomes of off-label drug use still make headlines. Even the New York Times mentioned Dr. Califf’s push for off-label promotion in his previous stint as FDA commissioner when President Biden appointed him to the role yet again in 2021.
“[T]he proposal, which many public health experts considered dangerous, was blocked by others in the Obama administration, according to a person familiar with it,” the paper noted.
Now that this criticism has died down a bit, he’s at it again, this time pushing for the off-label use of COVID-19 vaccines as a way to protect children from long COVID-19. He posted about this on X several months ago, sharing an article from the journal Nature about how the vaccines can somehow accomplish this.
Even the FDA has admitted this is not an authorized use. An FDA official told journalist Paul Thacker in a letter: “The FDA-approved and authorized coronavirus vaccines are indicated for active immunization to prevent COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The vaccines are not approved or authorized as a treatment for long COVID.”
They reiterated in a follow-up email that the vaccines have not been approved or authorized for preventing long COVID.
However, the article Califf linked to in Nature did indeed make this claim, and the fact that he shared it will have been interpreted by many as an endorsement of it. But the study was a small, observational one that had never undergone peer review.
It also contained a number of quotes from pediatric infectious disease specialist Dr. Jessica Snowden. One thing that the Nature article conveniently forgot to mention when they published it is the fact that Dr. Snowden received money from Pfizer for providing marketing talks about their COVID-19 jab and she sits on their advisory board. (This fact was added in a correction to the story, but not until much later.)
The study was problematic in many ways, especially the fact that it depended on self-reports of long COVID rather than an official diagnosis from a medical professional.
Dr. Califf’s questionable stance is back in the spotlight after he recently gave a speech about the threat of “medical misinformation.” As you might have guessed, he was referring, at least in part, to COVID-19 vaccines. He must have forgotten that he is a part of the problem.

5626,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-11-01,"US AI-Powered Drones Prove Their Worth in Ukraine’s Electronic Warfare Challenge
Shield AI, a California-based drone startup, has achieved a significant breakthrough in Ukraine with their V-BAT drone successfully operating in heavily jammed airspace, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report. The company’s success marks a rare victory for Western drone manufacturers in an environment where most unmanned aircraft struggle to survive.
Game-Changing AI Technology
The company’s V-BAT drone stands out for its revolutionary approach to autonomous flight. Unlike traditional drones that rely on GPS and radio control, Shield AI’s drones operate using Artificial Intelligence similar to self-driving car technology. The V-BAT can fly for 12 hours, cover 600 miles, and carry 25 pounds of payload – all without requiring GPS or remote pilot control.
“If you can’t put a pilot in the plane and you can’t control a plane remotely, how is the plane going to fly?” says Dan Gwak, managing partner at Point72 Private Investments and Shield AI board member. “There’s only one answer, and that’s AI.”
Impressive Field Performance
The drone proved its capabilities during testing near Kyiv, where it withstood seven different jammers running at full power over two days. Even more impressively, during an operation near Dnipro, the V-BAT flew more than 60 miles into Russian-controlled territory through heavily jammed airspace, successfully spotting a surface-to-air missile system.
“It feels like a good drone for battle,” said a Ukrainian drone pilot who goes by the call sign Kord. “A lot of the drones don’t pass this test because they don’t have the capabilities.”
Market Impact and Future Prospects
Shield AI’s success comes at a crucial time in the Drone Industry. Ukraine loses roughly 10,000 drones monthly to electronic warfare, highlighting the urgent need for jamming-resistant systems. The Ukrainian government has requested hundreds of Shield AI systems, with each V-BAT typically costing about $1 million.
Founded by Brandon Tseng, a former Navy SEAL, and his brother Ryan, Shield AI has raised about $800 million and is valued at nearly $3 billion. The company trails better-known defense firms like Anduril Industries and SpaceX but has made significant inroads with military customers. Both the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps currently use the V-BAT, and the Air Force is testing the company’s AI software for potential use in jet fighters.
Manufacturing and Deployment Challenges
Despite its technological achievements, Shield AI faces some hurdles. The company can currently only produce about 120 aircraft annually at their Frisco, Texas facility. Additionally, while Ukraine has requested the systems, funding remains uncertain. As Oleksandr Kamyshin, an adviser to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, notes, “Buying from outside is not the priority.”
DroneXL’s Take
This development represents a significant leap forward in drone technology/artificial intelligence. The ability to operate autonomously in GPS-denied environments isn’t just crucial for military applications – it could revolutionize civilian drone operations in urban environments, disaster zones, or areas with heavy electromagnetic interference. Shield AI’s success demonstrates that autonomous navigation systems can work reliably in the most challenging conditions, potentially opening new doors for civilian applications in infrastructure inspection, emergency response, and Urban Air Mobility."
3411,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-10-03,"TBILISI, Georgia — Georgian parliamentary speaker Shalva Papuashvili said in a Facebook post on Thursday that he had signed into law a “family values” bill curbing LGBT rights, just weeks before a high-stakes parliamentary election.
Lawmakers from the ruling Georgian Dream party last month approved the bill, which bans gender transitions and could outlaw pride marches and displays of the LGBT rainbow flag. The party says the law is necessary to protect Georgia’s Orthodox Christian church from outsiders.
President Salome Zourabichvili, a critic of the ruling party, had refused to sign the bill into law. Georgian Dream and its allies in parliament had enough seats to overcome her opposition.
Georgian LGBT activists say that the law is an attempt by Georgian Dream to boost support among conservative voters ahead of the Oct. 26 election, in which the party is seeking an unprecedented fourth term in power.
Some Western countries have criticized the bill, casting it as part of what they say is a turn towards authoritarianism and alignment with Russia in country that had mainly leaned towards the West since the breakup of the Soviet Union.
Opinion polls show that Georgian Dream remains the country’s most popular single party against a divided opposition, though it has lost ground since 2020, when it won almost 50% of the vote and a narrow majority in parliament.
Georgian Dream, founded by the country’s richest man, has also enacted a law requiring groups that receive funding from abroad to register as foreign agents, which its opponents say is modelled on legislation used to criminalise dissent in Russia.
Relations with Moscow have overshadowed politics for decades in Georgia, which has been a candidate to join NATO and the EU.
Moscow supports separatists in two ethnic regions who broke away from Tbilisi’s rule in wars in the 1990s, and Russian forces defeated Georgia in a brief war in 2008. Georgian Dream argues that its opponents would bring a return to war, and says it would pursue more stable relations with Russia."

Much of the United States is shivering through brutal cold as most of the rest of the world is feeling unusually warm weather. However strange it sounds, that contradiction fits snugly in explanations of what climate change is doing to Earth, scientists said.
In a map of global temperatures the last several days, big chunks of the world — the Arctic, Asia, parts of Africa, the Middle East and South America — show as dark red, signifying more than a dozen degrees Fahrenheit (7 degrees Celsius) warmer than the late 20th-century average. But the United States stands out like a cold thumb — a deep bluish-purple that is just as out of whack but on the frigid side.
Wind chills in parts of North Dakota reached minus 70 degrees (minus 56 degrees Celsius), while the heat index in Miami was more than 160 degrees warmer at 92 (33 degrees Celsius). The fourth-coldest NFL football game took place in Kansas City, while across the globe the thermometer hit a blistering 92 degrees, 12 degrees (6.8 degrees Celsius) warmer than average on Friday during tennis’ Australian Open in Melbourne. Warm temperature records fell overnight in Aruba, Curacao, parts of Argentina, Oman and Iran.
Where weather was warmer than usual, it was happening both in the southern hemisphere, which is in summer, and in the northern hemisphere, which is in winter. For example, Oman, in the north, had its warmest January night ever at 79.5 degrees (26.4 degrees Celsius). Argentina, in the south, had a record for warmest January night at 81.1 Fahrenheit (27.3 Celsius).
If it seems as if the world has gone topsy-turvy, in a way it has. Because this all comes from what’s happening in the Arctic, where it used to be warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet. Now, it’s warming three to four times faster.
“When the Arctic is off-the-charts warm (like now), we’re more likely to see frigid cold invade places like Texas that are ill-equipped to deal with it,” said Jennifer Francis, a Woodwell Research Center climate scientist and a pioneer in the theory of Arctic Amplification, which links the cold outbreaks to climate change. “Rapid Arctic warming is one of the clearest symptoms of human-caused climate change, making winter extremes more likely even as the globe warms overall.”
The way the cold is invading is through a weather phrase that is becoming increasingly familiar to Americans: The polar vortex. It’s a weather term that goes back to 1853 but has only been frequently used in the past decade or so.
That could be because the icy stabs are happening more often, said winter weather expert Judah Cohen of Atmospheric Environmental Research, a commercial firm outside of Boston.
The polar vortex is strong, icy weather that usually stays over the top of the planet, penned in by strong winds that whip around it, Cohen said.
It’s like an ice skater spinning rapidly with her arms tucked in, he said. But when the polar vortex weakens, the arms start flailing out, the skater slips and “all the cold air then gets released away from the center of the polar vortex,” Cohen said.
The current cold outbreak is consistent with Arctic change and the polar vortex, Cohen said. “What we found is when the polar vortex stretches like a rubber band, severe extreme winter weather is much more likely in the United States. That’s where it tends to be focused and in January we have an extreme case of that stretching of the polar vortex.”
This one is stronger and may last longer than most, Cohen said.
Cohen and others have done studies that show the polar vortex outbreaks have become more frequent in recent decades.
The idea is the jet stream — the upper air circulation that drives weather — is wavier in amplified global warming, said University of Wisconsin-Madison climate scientist Steve Vavrus. And those wave changes in the upper air knock the polar vortex out of its place and toward the United States, Cohen said.
It’s a theory still debated by climate scientists but growing in acceptance. Initially, Vavrus and Francis theorized it was due to melting Arctic sea ice leading to barometic pressure changes. Now several scientists say it’s more complicated, yet still connected to climate change and the supercharged warming in the Arctic, with other factors like Siberian snow cover and other atmospheric waves also playing a role.
“The key takeaway for me right now is that Arctic Amplification is happening and has complex interactions within our climate system. Winter will always bring us cold weather, but like the warm season it may be changing ways that we understand and ways that we are still learning about,” said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd. “Unlike the Vegas slogan, what happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic.”
Think of what’s happening as an orchestra making one symphony, and “what’s driving all those orchestra instruments is a warming planet,” Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini said.
Gensini and Cohen said this cold snap in the United States will fade in several days to be replaced by unusually warm weather, due to climate change. But another polar vortex looks like it’s coming at the end of the month, though not as strong as this one, they said.
Despite the U.S. cold, Earth’s global average temperature keeps flirting with daily, weekly and monthly records, as it has for more than seven months. That’s because the United States is only 2% of Earth’s surface, scientists said.
“A place like Chicago or Denver or Lincoln, Omaha, Oklahoma City, Dallas, Houston, I mean we’re all experiencing it,” said Gensini, who said the temperature outside his window Tuesday was 6 below. “We’re one isolated pocket if you look globally.”

3011,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-04-24,"The U.S. provided Ukraine with powerful long-range ballistic missiles for the first time earlier this month, and its military has already used them twice in the last week against Russian forces, according to three U.S. officials.
The first strike was about 100 miles inside Crimea’s border on the morning of April 17, targeting a Russian military airfield, according to the officials. The Ukrainian military used the U.S.-provided Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, for the second time Tuesday night, targeting Russian forces east of the southeastern Ukrainian town of Berdyansk in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, officials said.
The Biden administration has not previously acknowledged sending ATACMS to Ukraine, but a National Security Council spokesperson confirmed that the U.S. has provided them. They were part of the $300 million military aid package unveiled March 12.
The NSC spokesperson said the administration did not reveal at the time that it was sending Ukraine the long-range missiles for operational security reasons. President Joe Biden directed his national security team to send the ATACMS to Ukraine secretly, the spokesperson said.
The powerful missiles have a range up to 300 kilometers (about 187 miles) and allow Ukraine to strike the Russian military throughout Crimea and in occupied parts of eastern Ukraine that had been difficult to reach. The U.S.-provided ATACMS included both warheads with cluster munitions and with unitary blast fragmentation.
The revelation that Ukraine has used the long-range ATACMS came as Biden signed into law a foreign aid package providing billions of dollars in weapons and support to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. The measure, which will provide about $61 billion for Ukraine, was hung up for months due to opposition in the Republican-led House.
The Biden administration was already preparing a military aid package for Ukraine worth more than $1 billion, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning. It will include a range of equipment that the U.S. has already provided Ukraine, including ammunition, stinger missiles, artillery rounds, infantry fighting vehicles and other military equipment, the officials said.
NBC News was first to report in February that the Biden administration was planning to provide ATACMS to Ukraine.
Late last year, the U.S. began to supply Ukraine with the missiles, but until now they had limited the shipments to older medium-range models amid concerns that taking the longer-range ones from U.S. stockpiles could endanger military readiness. In early February, the U.S. Army presented a plan to buy new ATACMS directly from industry and send ones in storage to Ukraine, and the Biden administration approved.
The White House also concealed the decision to send the medium-range ATACMS in 2023, acknowledging it only after Ukraine used them in combat. Administration officials also cited operational security as the reason for its secrecy.
The Biden administration had resisted sending the long-range missiles over the past two years because officials worried Ukraine would use them to strike inside Crimea or Russia and prompt Russian President Vladimir Putin to escalate the conflict. White House and Pentagon officials have expressed similar concerns about other sophisticated weapons systems but have repeatedly decided to provide them to Ukraine.
But after multiple warnings to Russia not to use long-range weapons inside Ukraine and to stop attacking Ukrainian energy grids went unheeded, the White House decided to give Ukraine the same capabilities.
An NSC spokesperson said Biden directed his team to send the ATACMS after North Korea provided Russia with ballistic missiles that have now been used in Ukraine and after Russia has repeatedly attacked civilian infrastructure inside Ukraine.
The U.S. imposed limitations on the use of the long-range systems, including that they cannot be used to strike inside Russia and must be used within sovereign Ukrainian territory, which, according to the U.S. government, includes Crimea.
Testifying before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense last week, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned that without funding for more weapons to Ukraine, Russia is gaining the upper hand.
""We’re seeing the Ukrainians be challenged in terms of holding the line — they’re doing a very good job, a credible job — but in order to continue to do that, they’re going to need the right materials, the right munitions, the weapons to be able to do that,"" Austin said.
An NSC spokesperson said more military aid will provide a boost to Ukraine on the battlefield, but it cannot turn the tide of the war alone. Ukraine is running low on munitions and equipment, while Russia continues to launch waves of drones and missiles, the spokesperson said.
Speaking on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the new aid will give the country a chance at “victory” as it defends itself from Russia.
“I think this support will really strengthen the armed forces, I pray, and we will have a chance at victory if Ukraine really gets the weapons system, which we need so much, which thousands of soldiers need so much,” he said."

""Our operation is aimed at restoring our territorial integrity. We capture Russian troops to replace them with Ukrainian,"" he said. ""We tell them, you know, we need our military soldiers in exchange for Russian ones. The same attitude is to the territories. We don't need their land.""
Since its incursion began in the Kursk region in early August, Kyiv claims to have gained control of more than 1,200 kilometers of Russian territory.
Early reports hinted that the operation was intended to better position Kyiv in the event of peace talks amid some calls for more intense efforts to end the 36-month-old full-scale war.
Ukrainians and analysts have also suggested it is designed to drive the seriousness of the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine home to Russians.
It marked the first foreign invasion of Russian territory since World War II.
Kyiv and some of its allies have argued recently that Western providers of military aid, weapons, and artillery should further lift restrictions on how Ukrainian defense forces can use such supplies, including by allowing strikes deeper inside Russia.
Asked if Ukraine will seek to capture more Russian territory, Zelenskiy replied to NBC in English: ""I will not tell you. Sorry, I can't speak about it."

(Live Action) — The media has been spewing out stories right and left about women who have allegedly experienced life-threatening medical emergencies that supposedly warranted induced abortions, yet were unable to obtain them. You can see how our Live Action News team has fact-checked and/or debunked many of those stories here.
In addition, polls featuring vague and skewed wording continue to paint a confusing and illogical picture about the American public’s feelings about abortion at various gestational ages, after certain developmental milestones, and for various reasons. Commonly, even people who consider themselves “pro-life” say that they would allow abortion for reasons of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother (despite the fact that intentional killing is not medically necessary).
According to a new report, these “exceptions” continue to make up a very small percentage of the total number of abortions in the U.S. every year. Most U.S. abortions are elective abortion procedures, done for reasons other than these commonly accepted “exceptions.”

Research group claims 95% of abortions are elective
Charlotte Lozier Institute (CLI) Senior Research Associate Tessa Cox told Live Action News that the “official state data” the organization has reviewed in the past “shows that the vast majority of abortions, more than 95%, are for elective or unspecified reasons.”
“Less than 5% of abortions are performed because the mother or unborn baby has a physical health condition or because the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest,” Cox added.
Lozier’s report noted that just 0.4 percent of abortions are done due to rape, and 0.3 percent are done due to a risk to the woman’s life or major bodily function:
Cox pointed out that “many states don’t report reasons for abortions, and some large states like California don’t report any abortion data at all.”
What state data show
In 2023, the Guttmacher Institute found that “16 states require providers to give some information about the patient’s reason for seeking the procedure.” Out of those states, the former “special affiliate” to Planned Parenthood found:
- 11 states ask whether the abortion was performed because of a threat to the patient’s health or life.
- Eight states ask whether the abortion was performed because of rape or incest.
- 15 states ask whether the abortion was performed because of a diagnosed fetal abnormality.
- Nine states ask whether the abortion was performed for other reasons (e.g. the patient’s economic or familial circumstances).
For this report, Live Action News looked at the states which collect abortion data by reason, and found the following:
Alaska (2023) – The state does not seek reasons for abortion generally, but asks the question, “Was This Termination Elected Due to the Detection of a Congenital Anomaly?” and “Type of Congenital Anomaly.”
Less than 1 percent of abortions committed in Alaska in 2022 were for “congenital anomalies” and none were reported in 2023:
- 8,963 abortions committed because “abortion is elective.”
- 90 for fetal health/medical considerations.
- 40 for domestic violence.
- 40 for sexual assault.
- 2,611 declined to specify a reason.
2,442 abortions were listed in the “other” reasons category. These included 1,581 who “didn’t want to have children,” 150 who felt “unprepared” or “not ready” for children, 70 called it a “timing issue,” 150 gave “financial reasons,” 324 referred to “personal/emotional health,” 10 said the “father doesn’t want child/lack of support” and more. Additional reasons can be seen in the image below. Out of the 340 listed for “maternal health,” 258 were not specific and were categorized as “unknown” reasons.

Florida (2023) – Over 71 percent of total reported abortions in Florida (84,052) were reported as “elective” in 2023. This is a slight decrease from the 74 percent committed for elective reasons in 2021.
Out of the 59,901 recorded in 2023, nearly 55,000 babies aborted for “elective reasons” in Florida were killed during the first trimester. In the second trimester, 5,109 were aborted for “elective reasons.”
Less than 0.3 percent were for “Life Endangering Physical Condition (251),” and less than 1 percent were for either “incest (11)” or “rape (107)” or “fetal anomaly (141)” combined.
Hawaii (year reported) – While Guttmacher lists the state as tracking abortions for reasons of “fetal anomaly,” CLI has found that state reports are lagging, and they have been unable to obtain a copy for several years.
Illinois (2022) – While Guttmacher claimed that the state was tracking “other” reasons for abortions, the current published year does not contain this information. Older reporting forms indicate the state was gathering some data, asking whether the abortion was the “patient’s request” or “other.”
Louisiana (2022) – The state reported that out of 4,570 abortions recorded by reason, 1,350 (30 percent) were for “mental health of mother,” 103 (2.25 percent) for “physical health of mother,” less than 1 percent for “risk of fetal deformity (10)” and “rape or incest (21).”
In addition, 3,086 (66 percent) were categorized as “other,” which includes elective.
Minnesota (2022) – 12,175 abortions were committed in the state that year. Due to women selecting more than one reason, the data shows 14,768 abortions by reason.
This means that less than 1 percent were for rape or incest, while nearly 50 percent were because the client did not “want” children. Nearly 26 percent refused to specify a reason.
In addition, slightly more than 11 percent involved the emotional (7 percent) or physical health (4 percent) of the mother.
In the “other” category, women listed education and career, relationships, and feeling unready for children as reasons for seeking abortions.
READ: Washington Post publishes op-ed admitting late-term abortions are ‘not a myth’
A previous Live Action News report found that less than 1 percent of total reported abortions in Minnesota (10,136) in 2021 were committed for rape (44) or incest (11), while 54 percent of abortions were committed because the mother “d[id] not want children at this time.”
Nebraska (2023) – The state recorded 2,325 abortions committed that year. Because women may have selected more than one reason, the total reasons listed came to 2,684.
According to the report, nearly 7 percent of women claimed “contraceptive failure” led to their abortions, while over 12 percent admitted that a failure to use contraception was their reason for abortion. In addition, 42 percent of women listed “socio-economic” reasons. Nearly 23 percent “declined to answer” or give a reason.
Less than 1 percent of abortions were committed due to “maternal life endangered,” “emergency situation,” or “fetal anomaly.” These reasons combined totaled less than 2 percent of these reasons given. Sexual assault (0.63 percent) and incest (0.07 percent) were also less than 1 percent of abortions.
“Maternal physical health” accounted for 5 percent and “mental health” was recorded at over 8 percent.
New Jersey (year unknown) – According to Guttmacher, New Jersey tracks abortions committed for reasons of fetal abnormalities; however, the data was not publicly available.
New York (unknown) – Guttmacher claims the state tracks abortions for reasons of the health and life of the mother or fetal abnormalities; however, this data is not among the state’s public information.
North Dakota (2022) – In 2023, the state’s vital records department revealed that abortions had decreased substantially, but the state was unable to publish a report. Previous years’ reports did not show abortions by reasons, despite Guttmacher claiming they did require the data.
Oklahoma (2022) – In 2022, there were more than 2,160 answers by reason, because the individual could provide multiple answers.
- Shockingly, and despite the abortion industry claim that sex selective abortions do not occur, there were seven women who selected that they wanted to abort because “Mother wanted a child from a different sex.”
- Lack of support from the husband or father as well as lack of finances for the woman was also among the many reasons listed.
- Tragically, 424 women claimed it was their husband or partner who wanted the abortion.
In 2023, the state showed zero abortions were recorded.
South Dakota (2022) – The data showed that between 2018-2022, rape and incest accounted for between <1 percent up to as high as 3 percent of abortions in the state. Physical harm to the mother was the reason given by between 2 percent or as high as 3.6 percent of women seeking abortions.
The majority of abortions between 2018-2022 were committed because:
- Mother did not desire to have the child (ranging between 63.9 percent to as high as 70.4 percent).
- Mother could not afford the child (ranging between 46.4 percent to as high as 51.8 percent).
- Emotional health was unstable (ranging from 17 percent to as high as 23.4 percent).
The state reported zero abortions in 2023.

Utah (2021) – The state reported that “In 2021, there were nine choices for ‘Reasons for an abortion.’”
The reasons selected most often were socio-economic (1,474), elective (925), or contraception failure (447). These three reasons (2,846) together made up 96 percent of the 2,978 reasons for women living in Utah to have an abortion.
Abortions reported for rape made up less than half a percent, and none were reported for maternal life endangered.
Tragically, of the babies who were aborted at or after 21-weeks of gestation, nine were for “socio-economic reasons,” five for “fetal malformation,” and 24 were “not stated.”
Virginia (2022) – Guttmacher claims the state tracks some reporting by reason; however, public documents do not include this data.
Washington (2022) – Guttmacher claims the state tracks some reporting by reason; however, public documents do not include this data.
West Virginia (2023) – Guttmacher claims the state tracks some reporting by reason; however, public documents do not include this data. The state recorded just four (4) abortions in 2023.

Abortions for “contraceptive failure” totaled 471 in Nebraska in 2020 but fell to 180 by 2023. In Utah, while 76 “contraceptive failure” abortions were recorded in 2019, they rose to 447 by 2021.
“Assessing the number of abortions performed for various reasons can be challenging due to the poor quality of U.S. abortion data resulting from inconsistent reporting requirements,” CLI noted.
Cox suggested, “To provide an accurate picture of abortion trends post-Dobbs, all states should report this information.”

5217,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-08-20,"The proverbial “sugar high” that follows the ingestion of a sweet treat is a familiar example of the potentially positive effects of food on mood.
On the flip side, feeling “hangry” – the phenomenon where hunger manifests in the form of anger or irritability – illustrates how what we eat, or don’t eat, can also provoke negative emotions.
The latest research suggests that blood sugar fluctuations are partly responsible for the connection between what we eat and how we feel. Through its effects on our hormones and our nervous system, blood sugar levels can be fuel for anxiety and depression.
Mental health is complex. There are countless social, psychological and biological factors that ultimately determine any one person’s experience. However, numerous randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that diet is one biological factor that can significantly influence risk for symptoms of depression and anxiety, especially in women.
As a family medicine resident with a Ph.D. in nutrition, I have witnessed the fact that antidepressant medications work for some patients but not others. Thus, in my view, mental health treatment strategies should target every risk factor, including nutrition.
The role of the glycemic index
Many of the randomized controlled trials that have proven the link between diet and mental health have tested the Mediterranean diet or a slightly modified version of it. The Mediterranean diet is typically characterized by lots of vegetables – especially dark green, leafy vegetables – fruit, olive oil, whole grains, legumes and nuts, with small amounts of fish, meat and dairy products. One of the many attributes of the Mediterranean diet that may be responsible for its effect on mood is its low glycemic index.
The glycemic index is a system that ranks foods and diets according to their potential to raise blood sugar. Thus, in keeping with the observation that blood sugar fluctuations affect mood, high glycemic index diets that produce drastic spikes in blood sugar have been associated with increased risk for depression and to some extent anxiety.
High glycemic index carbohydrates include white rice, white bread, crackers and baked goods. Therefore, diets high in these foods may increase risk for depression and anxiety. Meanwhile, low glycemic index carbs, such as parboiled rice and al dente pasta, that are more slowly absorbed and produce a smaller blood sugar spike are associated with decreased risk.
How diet affects mood
Many scientific mechanisms have been proposed to explain the connection between diet and mental health. One plausible explanation that links blood sugar fluctuations with mood is its effect on our hormones.
Every time we eat sugar or carbohydrates such as bread, rice, pasta, potatoes and crackers, the resulting rise in blood sugar triggers a cascade of hormones and signaling molecules. One example, dopamine – our brain’s pleasure signal – is the reason we can experience a “sugar high” following the consumption of dessert or baked goods. Dopamine is the body’s way of rewarding us for procuring the calories, or energy, that are necessary for survival.
Insulin is another hormone triggered by carbohydrates and sugar. Insulin’s job is to lower blood sugar levels by escorting the ingested sugar into our cells and tissues so that it can be used for energy. However, when we eat too much sugar, too many carbs, or high glycemic index carbs, the rapid increase in blood sugar prompts a drastic rise in insulin. This can result in blood sugar levels that dip below where they started.
This dip in blood sugar sparks the release of adrenaline and its cousin noradrenaline. Both of these hormones appropriately send glucose into the bloodstream to restore blood sugar to the appropriate level.
However, adrenaline influences more than just blood sugar levels. It also affects how we feel, and its release can manifest as anxiety, fear or aggression. Hence, diet affects mood through its effect on blood sugar levels, which trigger the hormones that dictate how we feel.
Interestingly, the rise in adrenaline that follows sugar and carbohydrate consumption doesn’t happen until four to five hours after eating. Thus, when eating sugar and carbs, dopamine makes us feel good in the short term; but in the long term, adrenaline can make us feel bad.
However, not everyone is equally affected. Identical meals can produce widely varying blood sugar responses in different people, depending on one’s sex, as well as genetics, sedentariness and the gut microbiome.
And it’s important to keep in mind that, as previously mentioned, mental health is complicated. So in certain circumstances, no amount of dietary optimization will overcome the social and psychological factors that may underpin one’s experience.
Nevertheless, a poor diet could certainly make a person’s experience worse and is thus relevant for anyone, especially women, hoping to optimize mental health. Research has shown that women, in particular, are more sensitive to the effects of the glycemic index and diet overall.
Unfortunately, simple solutions, such as swapping sugar for artificial sweeteners, are not an option. Research has shown that among all processed foods, artificial sweeteners and artificially sweetened beverages are most strongly associated with depression.
Optimizing mood with food
The most obvious way to stabilize blood sugar levels is to decrease sugar and carbohydrate intake. However, this is not the only way. Research has proven that simple changes can drastically mitigate volatile blood sugar fluctuations. Some strategies to stabilize blood sugar and optimize mood include:
Make low glycemic index carbohydrates such as parboiled rice, whole grain bread and al dente pasta dietary staples and be mindful of how many high glycemic index carbohydrates you consume. I give my patients this guide to increase their awareness of the glycemic index of various carbohydrates.
Eat carbohydrates earlier in the day such as breakfast or lunchtime, as opposed to later in the day, like dinner or, worse yet, as a nighttime snack. Our hormones follow a circadian rhythm, and carbs eaten earlier in the day produce a smaller blood sugar spike compared with carbs eaten later in the day.
Avoid eating carbohydrates on their own, such as snacking on a box of crackers or downing a bowl of rice. Always strive to combine carbohydrates with proteins such as beans, nuts, meat and fish, or with healthy fats such as olive oil and avocado. The combination of nutrients slows down the digestion of carbohydrates and thereby produces a smaller blood sugar spike.
Eat carbohydrates at the end of the meal, after eating vegetables and protein first. Just changing the order in which foods are eaten can drastically lower the blood sugar spike that comes after.
Eat a salad dressed with olive oil and vinegar prior to eating carbohydrates. The combination of vegetables, acid from the vinegar and fat from the olive oil, all work together to slow carbohydrate absorption and minimize the resultant blood sugar spike."

The first of the results in the Republic of Ireland's local council elections have started to be declared.
A total of 949 city and county council seats will be filled across 31 local authorities. However, it could be the beginning of next week before all councillors are declared.
The polls closed at 22:00 local time on Friday.
Voting also took place in the Republic of Ireland on Friday in the European elections, but those ballots will be separated and local elections are counted first.
Irish state broadcaster RTÉ is reporting that current indications suggest the two main government parties, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, will likely be in a battle to be the largest party in local government.
Tallies suggest, however, that both parties will lose seats.
More than 2,100 candidates had been selected or declared for the local election.
The polls will provide political parties with an insight into voter sentiment.
The current Irish government has been in place since June 2020, when Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party voted to enter a coalition together.
The next election must be held by March 2025.
Speaking to reporters at Cork City Hall, Tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Micheál Martin said the government still intended to ""go full-term”.
“Local election results do not correlate the general election results,” the Fianna Fáil politician said.
However local elections can help “in terms of bringing new candidates forward” for general elections, he added.
Paschal Donohoe, minister for public expenditure, said while it was still early days, it appeared his party - Fine Gael - had been successful in ""getting out its votes"".
""The early tallies show that there is a large majority of people who are willing to vote in a very different way to how extremists and the far right will make the case for,"" he added.
The full results of the elections will take days to be finalised because Ireland uses a system of proportional representation which allows voters to rank every candidate in each race by order of preference.
The process means ballot papers are sorted and counted multiple times by hand.
Analysis: A 'defeat' for Sinn Féin?
The two main coalition government parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, can breathe a collective sigh of relief as their losses are not expected to be on the scale many had predicted.
For Sinn Féin, on the other hand, a victory is being seen by many as a relative defeat.
The main opposition party will have more councillors elected to local authorities this time, but not as many as it wanted or expected.
The party will now have to figure out why, especially at a time when the government has been under sustained pressure on a number of fronts, notably over a long term housing crisis and a more recent crisis around immigration.
One theory is that the party miscalculated and ran too many candidates. But even before polling day, opinion polls were suggesting a drop in popularity for Sinn Féin.
Away from the big parties, the big winners in this election could be independent candidates.
Among those expected to be elected to Donegal County Council are a number of members of the 100% Redress Party.
The party has been campaigning for 100% government redress for thousands of residents whose homes have been crumbling due to defective blocks.
Speaking to RTÉ, Sinn Féin's finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty said the party would make gains in some counties, but added there would be a lot of disappointment among new candidates.
It had been a tough election, Mr Doherty said, adding there was still a lot to play for and there were strong indicators coming from the three constituencies for the European election.
Sinn Féin had a disappointing local election in 2019, he added, but nine months later the party saw candidates who missed out being elected to parliament.
He said Sinn Féin would ""dust themselves down"" and look at ""the lessons that can be learned"".
One voter cast more than her vote at her polling station in Bray, County Wicklow.
Oona McFarland was separated from a very special ring when it fell into the ballot box.
Staff at the polling station noted down the number of the box, which meant count staff were extra careful when separating votes.
She was reunited with the ring which is in memory of her late daughter at the count centre on Saturday.
""It is a very sentimental ring, so I'm delighted to have it back,"" Ms McFarland said.
How many EU seats are being filled?
About 373m people across the EU are eligible to vote to elect 720 MEPs in the European elections.
Voting has been taking place across Europe over four days, and as a result, Ireland will not start counting European votes until Sunday 9 June.
Results cannot be announced until after 22:00 local time on Sunday when voting has ended across Europe.
Fourteen MEPs will be sent back to Brussels from the Republic of Ireland.
Five will represent the constituency of Midlands North-West, a 15-county constituency in which 27 candidates are running.
Five will represent Ireland South, where 23 candidates are running across 10 counties.
And four will represent Dublin, where there are also 23 candidates on the ballot.
Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said his party was at risk of losing its existing MEP seat in Dublin, which is currently held by Ciarán Cuffe.
Speaking to RTÉ News at the RDS count centre in Dublin, Mr Ryan said Mr Cuffe was “in with a chance” of the final seat in the four-seat constituency.
Counting will also take place for the country's first directly elected mayor in Limerick, with 15 candidates vying for the job."

When the World Economic Forum called “misinformation” the single largest identified risk in early 2024, it was the latest call of many, with an express, not-so-carefully-hidden objective.
The idea of censorship in the name of “misinformation” began with the United Nations in 1945, specifically with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (“UNESCO”).
The following is a tweet posted by Escape Key describing the history of the use of “misinformation” as a tool of censorship to which we have added hyperlinks.

Censoring Free Speech
By Escape Key
It seems strange that we, in the West, have to put up with even dealing with this question, given that our entire framework fundamentally rests upon a cornerstone of free speech. Yet, here we are.
But where did this drive come from?
And in that regard – yes, a number of recent initiatives exist, including those outlined by [Michael] Shellenberger. But they don’t step back in time to identify the roots – which incidentally is where these issues will have to be addressed. Or else the issue will just come right back when you least expect it, in much the same way those dandelions on your neighbours’ lawn arrive on yours.
In reality, the call for censorship is a two-pronged drive; while one is the public drive we see at the likes of Davos, there’s a hidden drive the fruits of which we also very much experienced during the scamdemic. And this drive led to doctors and other health industry professionals being fired for refusing to carry out orders.
But first, it’s important to understand a little bit of background, and this story starts in London, 1945. Predictably, this is about the United Nations, specifically, UNESCO. Because almost as soon as the ink was dry on the agreement which founded UNESCO itself, they turned around and signed an agreement with ICSU [International Council for Science], which in more ways than one was the “S” in UNESCO.
The overall scheme was set for the long term. Consequently, what better organisation to infiltrate but the one responsible for producing the “best available science,” ICSU, and educating the young? And this partnership worked wonderfully for many years, leading to progressive brainwashing to the point where a majority of people now believe plant food is a pollutant. And naturally, ICSU, their committees (i.e., SCOPE ), and many of their scientists were generously funded by … wait, I don’t want to spoil the surprise.
In 1989, at the request of Collegium International founding Michel Rocard, the French National Consultative Ethics Committee for Health and Life Science delivered opinions on “ethics in science.” These opinions went through still a conference in still-communist Moscow in 1991, becoming ‘Bioethics and Human Rights’. In 1995, Clinton established the National Bioethics Advisory Committee, just 3 years before the first successful culturing of human stem cells in a lab. And in 1996, the ICSU created their ‘Standing Committee on Responsibility and Ethics of Science’, a panel comprising of almost entirely “soft” scientists disregarding the claimed “hard” science background of the ICSU. And this then kicked UNESCO into gear, first launching COMEST in 1998, and then to release their publication, ‘Science, ethics, and responsibility‘, in 2000.
But COMEST was different in scope – while ICSU’s SCRES focused on scientists and science in general, COMEST also included the delivery of science to the people in general. External communication. And what also took place in May 1998 was the Clinton administration dealing the “escalating threat posed by information warfare, information terrorism, and cybercrime.” On this point Russia more than agreed; in October of that same year, they penned the UN General Assembly resolution A/C.1/53/L.17 outlining the “misuse or exploitation of information resources or technologies for criminal or terrorist purposes.”
So, at this stage, we have the ICSU SCRES dealing with internal matters within the fields of science, and UNESCO COMEST – with some level of overlap – dealing with communication of “the best available science” to the public at large – external matters. But to make further progress, what was needed was a disaster. An event so large, you’d be marked the fool for even daring to question it.
9/11. Or more specifically, the anthrax attacks.
In March 2002, the Eubios Declaration for International Bioethics arrived. This was then followed by calls for “ethics declarations” in the various STEM fields, eventually leading to even preposterous, contemporary calls for “ethics in mathematics,” having shoved through declarations in practically all other fields. The objective of those ethics declarations, of course, is to create a parallellegal justice system, where you can get fired by an undemocratically selected “ethics panel” for daring to question any aspect of fraud. The scamdemic was a clear example of that, as healthcare professionals en masse were dismissed for “ethics violations.” This will also soon take place in the field of “Climate Change,” as related “ethics declarations” were discussed in the Eubios Journal of Asian and International Bioethics already in May 2009 (EJAIB Vol 19/3), also making a note of the “health implications of climate change.” And in that same year, COMEST prepared the report titled ‘Ethics and Climate Change‘.
The public still presented an issue, however. So, the work of the Clinton administration and Russia on “information terrorism” gradually turned into claims of “dangerous misinformation,” and eventually became overt calls for “restrictions” on free speech, including for the sake of “public health and morals” in the 2009 document ‘Camden Principles on Freedom of Expression and Equality‘, ultimately calling for an ombudsman on the topic. This work was then carried forward by the ‘Rabat Declaration‘ of 2013, released by the United Nations Human Rights Council (A/HRC/22/17/Add.4).
However, what the Camden Principles also outlined was the “right to be forgotten,” and in 2010, France introduced legislation on exactly that. And these led to Dan Shefet in 2013 suing Google, forcing them to globally remove information, after which he launched the Association for Accountability and Internet Democracy, who would go on to cooperate with UNESCO in 2018 on their conference in Canada titled ‘Internet and the Radicalisation of Youth‘, from which the ‘Call of Quebec‘ was launched, outlining the implementation of “measures for preventing radicalisation.” Meanwhile, another United Nations agency – the ITU [International Telecommunication Union] – with UNESCO involvement launched the Broadband Commission, which in 2017 started work on “protecting children online,” along with calling for “media literacy education.” This led to two reports, the latter of which was titled ‘Balancing Act: Countering Digital Disinformation While Respecting Freedom of Expression‘. And this document outlined the idea of “developing responses that reduce or remove visibility.” This naturally relates to “fact-checked” social media posts, and could also be described as “free speech but not reach.”
The idea of an “internet ombudsman” continuously resurfaced in documents, and in August 2020, in cooperation with UNESCO, the Hyderabad Declaration was released, titled ‘Access to Information in a time of crisis’, where said crisis obviously referred to covid-19. The document calls for “the moral balancing” of free speech, and helpfully suggests a centralisation of information while respecting “the right to be forgotten.” It carries on, outlining the difference between mis- and disinformation being intent, which obviously is impossible to determine with any level of certainty. A point also made clear through the release of “UN2.0,” which goes on to state conflicting definitions of disinformation on a singular page.
But we’ve skipped a bit of history. Because while the Broadband Commission was busy, determining how to most efficiently silence you in the future, the Annenberg Public Policy Centre put together a ‘Transatlantic Working Group on Content Moderation Online and Freedom of Expression‘, a group including not only a wealth of WEF members, but also UK Tory MP Damian Collins, Michael Chertoff, Thomas Hendrik Ilves, and David Kaye. I left him for last because he on Twitter would later outline his definition of free speech which includes “respect of the rights or reputations of others,” though said principles clearly didn’t apply to himself, as he on the same day in the most juvenile manner possible would address Elon Musk’s “grade school version of free speech; quisling in the face of government demands, Soros-baiting antisemitism, 2nd amendment extremism.” Incidentally, Kaye is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and in the years 2014-2020 worked as a Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and Opinion … for the United Nations.
Damian Collins would then go to work, pushing for censorship in the UK Parliament, having previously pushed every imaginable bug-eyed conspiracy about especially Russia. Another member of the Transatlantic Working Group was Barbora Bukovská, who just by amazing coincidence also helped draft the Camden Principles in 2009.
I’m now going to spoil the surprise, which isn’t really one. Because, as per usual, the Rockefeller Foundation funded not only the ICSU, SCOPE, and many of their scientists, but they also – through the Spelman fund in the early 1930s – funded the International Institute of Administrative Sciences, an organisation strongly connected to Guy Braibant, an openly self-declared communist. And why is that important? Because it was he, who chaired that 1989 French National Consultative Ethics Committee which produced the first outline on ethics in science.
On 1 January 2020, the HK[S] Misinformation Review launched. The first edition outlined misinformation, disinformation, anti-vaccination, an indirect plea for censorship, and they further questioned what constitutes “ethical research.” This initiative can be traced back to a workshop at Harvard, which also included Renee DeResta and Sander van der Linden. This was then followed by a 5 Jan article by ABC News titled ‘5 ways to spot disinformation on your social media feeds‘ [the article was taken down and an article with the same title was republished on 29 May] and in late January, the Washington Post announced that ‘Facebook, Google and Twitter scramble to stop misinformation about coronavirus’, at a time where the gross levels of genuine disinformation hadn’t truly been ramped up by the likes of the WHO and the MSM.
Of course, the UK has recently passed legislation pushing censorship, and the European Union’s Digital Services Act is by intent crumbling the very foundation of Western Democracy through the rest of the continent, leaving really only America still standing.
Don’t allow it to happen over there.
God Bless America.

3773,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-09-24,"Thousands of women are dying from heart disease worldwide because of the misconception that it is a “man’s disease”, doctors and scientists say.
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) was the “number one killer” of women but, despite significant progress in its medical management, many were dying “unnecessarily” because they were underdiagnosed, undertreated and under-represented in clinical trials, the experts said.
A consensus statement drawn up by 33 leading health figures affiliated with the British Cardiovascular Society aimed to address unmet needs, ensuring parity of care and improving the health outcomes of women with CVD in the UK and worldwide.
Among other things, it called for dedicated women’s heart champions and heart hubs to prevent the “needless death toll” from an essentially preventable disease.
Conventional risk factors, such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol, were often not treated as promptly or as appropriately as they were in men, despite accounting for about half of all preventable cardiovascular disease deaths, the statement said.
Women also faced particular cultural, societal, and financial issues, which magnified their heart disease risks. In addition, their biology, physiology and body shape not only affected their risk of CVD but also the effectiveness of diagnostic procedures and treatment, it added.
Healthcare professionals and the public mistakenly believed that women’s risk of CVD was lower than men’s, the statement said. “Myths and unconscious biases within clinical practices and societal perceptions further obscure the reality that heart disease does not discriminate by sex,” it said.
All too often women’s voices went unheard and their heart symptoms were not taken seriously enough, it added.
Published in the medical journal Heart, the consensus statement said: “Globally, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in women. However, the misconception that it is a ‘man’s disease’ underlines that CVD in women has contributed to its under-recognition and undertreatment.
“Over 3.6 million women in the UK are currently affected by ischaemic heart disease, which kills one in 14 women.”
The experts said there was a “discrepancy” between men and women when it came to diagnosis and treatment, with women less likely to receive certain treatments or diagnostic tests.
Women were also “frequently under-referred for treatment, which leads to poorer outcomes”, they added. The statement also highlighted that women were “under-represented” in clinical research about CVD.
The statement’s lead author, Prof Vijay Kunadian, said: “Heart disease, in particular coronary artery disease, is the number one killer for women in the UK and worldwide. And yet, even to this day, we see that their symptoms are being ignored or [women are] told there is nothing wrong with them, or treated for something else, when all along they might be suffering from a heart problem.”
Global databases were showing “year after year” that women were being undertreated and that was leading to higher death rates after heart attacks. “We can’t ignore that any more, it is about time that we do something about it.”
Lives were being lost needlessly because “if women received the correct treatment, then their lives could be saved”, Kunadian said.
“People assume it is a men’s disease – when a man complains he is more likely to get the attention from the ambulance or the doctors for example,” she added. “So we need to change the perspective of people and make people think this is also a woman’s condition.”
In the UK, the Department of Health and Social Care has vowed to prioritise women’s health, which it said had been neglected by the previous government."
2226,real,ANTI_MIGRATION_AND_XENOPHOBIA,2024-06-05,"UN migration and refugee agencies cite 'fundamental' right to asylum after US moves to restrict it
The U.N.’s refugee agency has expressed concern over plans for new asylum restrictions in the United States
GENEVA -- The U.N.'s migration and refugee agencies expressed concern over Biden administration plans for new asylum restrictions in the United States and said the right to asylum is fundamental.
President Joe Biden on Tuesday unveiled plans to enact immediate significant restrictions on migrants seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border as the White House tries to neutralize immigration as a political liability ahead of the November elections.
The move would bar migrants from being granted asylum when officials deem that the southern border with Mexico is overwhelmed. It comes after the collapse months ago of a bipartisan border security deal in Congress that most Republican lawmakers rejected at the behest of former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.
Refugee agency UNHCR urged the U.S. to ""reconsider restrictions that undermine the fundamental right to seek asylum.”
“The new measures will deny access to asylum for many individuals who are in need of international protection, and who may now find themselves without a viable option for seeking safety and even at risk of refoulement,” it said in a statement issued late Tuesday, referring to a term for turning people back to places where they could face persecution.
“Any person who claims to have a well-founded fear of being persecuted in their country of origin must have access to safe territory and have this claim assessed before being subject to deportation or removal,” the agency added.
The U.N.’s International Organization for Migration, which is run by Amy Pope, a former senior adviser on migration for Biden, was more muted.
“IOM acknowledges the challenges posed by the increasing irregular crossings of migrants at the United States-Mexico border,” the organization said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press. “It is crucial that any measures taken to manage migration respect the fundamental right to seek asylum, as well as to strengthen safe and regular migration pathways.”
Biden's order will go into effect when the number of border encounters between ports of entry hits 2,500 per day, senior administration officials said. That means the order should go into effect immediately, because the daily averages are higher now.
Average daily arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico were last below 2,500 in January 2021, the month Biden took office. The last time the border encounters dipped to 1,500 a day was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The restrictions would be in effect until two weeks after the daily encounter numbers are at or below 1,500 per day between ports of entry, under a seven-day average.
As migration increases around the world with millions of people fleeing wars, hunger, climate change or simply seeking a better future for themselves and their families, wealthy countries have been looking for ways to restriction the influx. Far-right populist parties have been exploiting the issue with anti-migration rhetoric to gain votes in elections from Europe to the U.S. and beyond.

6109,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-10-19,"Defense chiefs from the Group of Seven (G7) developed economies vowed to support Ukraine's ""irreversible path"" to eventual NATO membership and pledged continued military support in the ""short and long term"" as Kyiv battles against Russia's full-scale invasion.
The leaders on October 19 also condemned Moscow for its military aggression along with its deployment of ""hybrid warfare"" and the ""irresponsible use of nuclear rhetoric.""
""We underscore our intent to continue to provide assistance to Ukraine, including military assistance in the short and long term,"" the G7 said in a joint statement following its summit in Naples.
“We support Ukraine on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership,” it added.
Italy, which holds the 2024 rotating chair of the group, hosted the event that also included the United States, Canada, France, Britain, Germany, and Japan and representatives of the European Union and NATO.
Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, who attended the event, ""expressed gratitude for the constant support in the fight against Russian aggression,"" his office said.
The G7 defense chiefs said in their statement that they ""consider it imperative to continue supporting the education and training needs of the Ukrainian defense and security forces...given the need for force regeneration and reconstitution.""
It noted the G7 decision to make available an estimated $50 billion by using revenue derived from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine, including military, budgetary, and reconstruction assistance.
""We consider it a priority to work now to find solutions to create a Ukrainian military interoperable with supporting member states and NATO, capable of defending Ukraine now, and deterring further attacks in the future,"" it said.
""This process must be based on coordinated and sustained actions across relevant state and international actors.""
It said that Ukraine had ""for nearly three years defended itself against Russia's brutal and full-scale illegal war of aggression.""
""We condemn Russia, which has put in place a posture of confrontation and destabilization on a global scale, also resorting to hybrid warfare and the irresponsible use of nuclear rhetoric.""
Since February 2022, when he sent tens of thousands of troops across the border to invade Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly hinted and threatened that Russia was ready to tap into its nuclear arsenal -- the world's largest -- to defend itself."
5815,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-10-18,"U.S. President Joe Biden met with Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin ahead of joint talks on Ukraine with the leaders of Germany, France, and Britain as Russia continued its daily strikes on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, launching on October 18 ""one of the most massive"" drone attacks on the country.
Biden's visit to Germany comes a day after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy presented EU leaders and NATO top officials with a set of measures that he said would help his embattled country put an end to Russia's 31-month invasion.
Biden called on Ukraine's allies to maintain their determination and back the embattled country as it heads into a difficult third winter of war
He praised Scholz for backing Kyiv and saying Berlin ""rose to meet the moment"" in the wake of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, welcoming Germany's raising its defense spending to a NATO target of 2 percent of its gross domestic product.
""You showed the wisdom to recognize that this war marked a turning point in history,"" Biden told Scholz before the two headed into their meeting, adding that ""America and Germany are the two largest supporters of Ukraine in its fight for survival as a free and independent nation.""
Biden started his visit with a meeting with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who presented him with the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit, Germany's highest award.
""When you were elected president, you restored Europe's hope in the transatlantic alliance literally overnight,"" Steinmeier told Biden -- in reference to the cooling of relations between Washington and Berlin during President Donald Trump's time in office.
After separate talks, Biden and Scholz will hold a joint meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer during the U.S. leader's compressed 24-hour visit as he nears the final months of his presidential term.
Biden, who arrived in Germany late on October 17, was originally due to visit the country last week on four-day visit that would have included him attending a meeting of the Ramstein group of some 50 allies of Ukraine to discuss and coordinate further military aid for the Ukraine as it faces a difficult winter ahead.
However, Biden canceled the trip in order to coordinate the U.S. response to Hurricane Milton.
National-security adviser Jake Sullivan has said Biden was seeking ""to make our commitment to Ukraine sustainable and institutionalized for the long term.""
Zelenskiy on October 17 outlined details of his ""victory plan"" to Ukraine's EU and NATO allies as he sought to convince them to give Ukraine an invitation to joint the military alliance -- a move that he argued would tamper down Moscow's will to continue the war and force it to negotiate in good faith.
However, while declaring that Ukraine will eventually become a member, NATO has so far not given a clear deadline, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Kyiv's intention to join the alliance was one of the reasons for Russia's invasion.
NATO chief Mark Rutte, while reaffirming that NATO is working to get Ukraine ever closer to the alliance, stopped short of endorsing Zelenskiy's call for an invitation to join the alliance.
RFE/RL's Ukraine Live Briefing gives you the latest developments on Russia's invasion, Western military aid, the plight of civilians, and territorial control maps. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.
""Ukraine will be member of NATO, there is no doubt about it, and until that happens we will make sure that Ukraine has everything it needs to prevail,"" Rutte said, adding it was essential NATO continued to provide the country with military aid.
Earlier, U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith told reporters that while Kyiv's path toward eventual NATO membership was irreversible, ""we are not at the point right now where the alliance is talking about issuing an invitation in the short term.""
Kyiv has been hard-pressed to rally its Western allies as its outmanned and outgunned forces have faced a slow but continuous advance of Russian troops in the east.
Furthermore, the upcoming U.S. presidential election raises concerns about how the two candidates, Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, would deal with the war in Ukraine.
Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Zelenskiy during his presidential campaign, on October 17 blamed the Ukrainian leader for allegedly helping start the conflict, even though the war began with Russia's unprovoked invasion.
""That doesn't mean I don't want to help him [Zelenskiy] because I feel very badly for those people. But he should never have let that war start. The war's a loser,"" Trump said on the podcast of Patrick Bet-David.
In Ukraine, meanwhile, Russia launched one of its largest waves of drone strikes early on October 18 , the head on Kyiv's military administration, Serhiy Popko, reported.
""Russian troops carried out one of the most massive drone attacks on the civilian population and infrastructure of Ukraine. Enemy drones also threatened Kyiv. But thanks to the coordinated work of the defense forces, all drones moving toward the capital were neutralized,"" Popko wrote on Telegram.
There were no immediate reports of casualties during the attack on Kyiv, which lasted for more than 4 1/2 hours, Popko said.
Ukraine's air force said attacks targeted the Kyiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Vinnytsya, Chernihiv, Sumy, and Poltava regions and air-raid alerts were still active in some regions. Ukrainian air defenses downed 80 out of the 135 drones launched by Russia, it said on Telegram."
2272,real,ANTI_MIGRATION_AND_XENOPHOBIA,2024-02-08,"The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, have unveiled plans for a €210m partnership with Mauritania in an attempt to curb people-smuggling to the Canary islands and launch new energy and infrastructure projects benefiting both sides.
Figures soon to be published by Frontex, the EU’s border agency, are expected to show that the number of people risking their lives by making the perilous journey from west African shores to the Spanish islands has risen dramatically in the past year.
The EU leaders met Mauritania’s president, Mohamed Ould Ghazouani, on Thursday morning to “discuss security, migration and stability in the Sahel region”.
Von der Leyen commended Ghazouani for the support his country was giving to 150,000 refugees, and pledged humanitarian aid as part of the package which they hoped to sign-off in the spring.
She also announced investment support for a new high-voltage power line between the capital and the south-east of the country and improved roads to the north, where Mauritania hopes to develop wind, solar and hydrogen energy supplies in conjunction with the EU.
In addition, there would be support for training defence forces to help secure the border with Mali, she said. “The situation in the Sahel is very precarious and Mauritania plays a key role in ensuring stability in the region,” she said.
Investing in African infrastructure has long been seen as a route to influence by China and Russia, but the EU is also interested in strengthening security in west Africa, where France’s influence in countries such as Mali and Burkina Faso is seen to have waned significantly.
Sánchez said Mauritania played “a fundamental role as the democratic reference for the stability in the Sahel, a crucial region for Spain and for Europe” with “the fall of democratic governments, rise of terrorist attacks, a spike in refugees and internally displaced people and the worsening of an already acute food security crisis” in the area.
The path for a partnership with Mauritania was cleared last October, when the EU and Ghazouani made plans for foreign inward investment to help Mauritania decarbonise in an initiative backed by the European Investment Bank.
Von der Leyen spoke of the many “cynical traps” that migrants and refugees may fall into, describing the Atlantic people-smuggling route as “one of the most dangerous in the world”.
The west African country, along with its southern neighbour, Senegal, is a significant embarkation point for thousands of people seeking to reach the Canaries. Sources say the route is now the “most active” for people smugglers luring travellers into high-risk journeys to the EU.
Data shows 7,270 people were smuggled across the 900-mile stretch of water in January, up from 566 in the same month in 2023, the Spanish interior ministry said last week.
Sánchez said he would work to strengthen existing collaboration on border control between the two countries and “explore possible pathways to enable regular migration”."
3643,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-10-04,"A Marco Rubio-linked thinktank stoking fears about Haitian migrants in Pennsylvania has also produced a sequence of videos in recent months that promote conspiracy theories about LGBTQ+ people, human rights organizations and even the corporate consultancy McKinsey & Company.
The editor hired to produce those videos also produces for the media organization founded by Mike Lindell, the MyPillow chief and prominent election-denier who is a close ally of the former US president Donald Trump.
The videos and the ongoing campaign against Haitians – which follows a similar effort in Springfield, Ohio, that has caused chaos in the midwestern city – raise questions about the increasingly extreme political rhetoric used in Republican circles. Two experts told the Guardian that the ads contained elements of fascist rhetoric.
The producers
The videos on the channel are not clearly attributed to any individuals. They are mostly voiced by the rightwing political operative Nate Hochman, but not all of them are, according to an email sent to the Guardian after publication by Mike Needham, the America 2100 founder.
Needham wrote that that one of them, on McKinsey & Company, was voiced by another person. The Guardian had emailed Hochman and Needham ahead of publication with a request for comment and clarification on who narrated the videos. Needham’s only response was to write: “Your reporting is dishonest, pathetic, and aimed at intimidating people you disagree with from participating in the public sphere.”
The Guardian reported last month that Hochman has been the face of a campaign to establish Charleroi, Pennsylvania, as a new focus for the racist fear campaign about Haitian migrants. That campaign intensified after Trump made false claims about Haitians eating their neighbors’ pets in Springfield, Ohio.
Previously, Hochman has weathered scandals over his proximity to the far right.
In mid-2022 he lost a fellowship after a conservative website revealed that he had recorded a friendly conversation on Twitter with the white nationalist influencer Nick Fuentes, who has openly praised nazism.
In July 2023 Hochman was fired from Ron DeSantis’s abortive presidential campaign over a campaign video he reportedly produced that featured neo-Nazi imagery.
Mason Prickett, meanwhile, claims credit on his website for the videos’ production, describing them as a “collection of videos I’ve produced for America 2100”. Prickett also claims credit for “motion assets made for FrankSpeech Properties”. FrankSpeech is a video streaming site founded by Lindell, the pillow entrepreneur, Trump supporter and one of the most prominent public deniers of the 2020 election result.
In a story published last month, the Guardian revealed America 2100 was launched in June 2023 by Mike Needham, Rubio’s former chief of staff.
A Real Clear Politics report on the launch said the thinktank had “Rubio’s blessing”, and would prioritize “the work of codifying and institutionalizing the ideas Rubio helped pioneer”.
The book Rubio launched at the same time was reported as a milestone in the senator’s transformation “from a darling of the Republican establishment into a populist gadfly armed with policy”, which was “aided, in large part” by Needham.
Pride month
Several of the videos embed anti-LGBTQ+ messaging in conspiracy theory narratives.
One, published to YouTube on 12 June – the month many celebrate as LGBTQ+ Pride month – is titled How Pride Month Is Destroying and Replacing American Symbols and Identity. In the video, Hochman says the “customs and symbols of the LGBT movement”, including “half naked men, gyrating suggestively in front of young children”, are “viscerally offensive” to many Americans.
He claims that this is part of an “ongoing attack on the traditional symbols of America”, which also includes “a push to replace Thanksgiving with an Indigenous day of mourning”.
These “new symbols and new traditions”, Hochman claims, are an attempt “to shape a new moral, cultural and political order”. Pride month, he says, is a “symbolic tool of an ongoing revolution meant to undermine and replace the symbols of American history and identity”.
Human rights campaign
Six days later, still during Pride month, another Hochman-voiced video was published to YouTube, which directly accused the LGBTQ+ rights organization Human Rights Campaign (HRC) of leveraging the annual celebration to sinister ends.
The video was titled How the “Human Rights Campaign” Forces Companies to Bend the Knee to the Radical LGBTQ Agenda, and a caption on YouTube asks: “Do you ever wonder how everything got so … gay?”
In the recording, Hochman says: “Even just a few decades ago, Pride month meant a few parades and a handful of carefully worded statements.”
He continues: “Now, every major business, brand and institution is all in on LGBT.”
Hochman then claims: “The roots of a lot of this lie with a group called the Human Rights Campaign, a powerful LGBT activist group.”
An HRC spokesperson, Sam Lau, said: “Fascists and authoritarian sympathizers target the Human Rights Campaign and the LGBTQ+ community for the same reason they target people of color, women, immigrants and anyone who doesn’t think and look like them – because they are desperate to cling to power.”
Lau added: “They know we are the majority and that the American people believe in equality”, and they use “inflammatory, false rhetoric to try to demonize our communities and scare us out of public view”.
Lau also pointed to what he called “dangerous consequences”, adding: “Reports of hate crime incidents targeting people for their sexual orientation or gender identity are rising.”
Lau cited a media report about FBI data released in August that showed anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes in 2023 rose 8.6% from 2022 numbers.
The McKinsey conspiracy theories
One video titled How the Deep State Infiltrates Presidential Administrations Using McKinsey & Company accuses the consultancy of being “a key player in the globalist network that is working to subvert the American nation”.
The narrator also claims in the video, published to YouTube on 16 August: “For nearly a century, the firm has infiltrated every successive presidential administration.”
This includes the Trump administration, according to Hochman, who says in the video, “When Donald Trump came to power, McKinsey didn’t go away, they went to work,” and placed “allies and partners in key positions in his administration”.
The video provides little evidence for these claims, or for the idea that McKinsey has “deep state ties”.
The Guardian contacted McKinsey, and its spokesperson declined to comment.
The video concludes with a warning: “If Donald Trump defeats Kamala Harris, McKinsey will waste no time trying to infiltrate the Trump transition again.”
Rubio links
The YouTube channel also features several shorts, including one showcasing Marco Rubio’s shift on immigration issues.
A decade ago the Republican Florida senator was part of a bipartisan effort to pass immigration reforms that would have given undocumented residents a path to citizenship. In the video he draws an unfavorable comparison between the established Cuban American community and recent refugees, who he says receive overly generous welfare from the federal government.
R Michael Alvarez, a professor of political science at Caltech who has published on topics including political campaigns, voter behavior and conspiracy theory thinking, said the videos as a whole were “very dark”, with a focus on “hidden forces, hidden agents”.
Alvarez added: “I worry about these materials being microtargeted at people with those beliefs,” and called that possibility “dangerous”.
Fascist rhetoric?
The Guardian also contacted two professors of rhetoric, each with published research on fascist rhetorical tactics, to see how Hochman’s political appeals compared to those made during the darkest periods of 20th-century mass politics.
Nathan Crick of Texas A&M University published a book-length analysis of fascist rhetoric in 2022. Ryan Skinnell of San Jose State University, meanwhile, has a range of published research on the rhetoric of fascism, Hitler and Donald Trump.
Both said that the materials did not contain all the elements of fascist rhetoric, and so could not be unambiguously described as such. However, Crick said they had “fascist overtones”, and Skinnell wrote that the videos contained “very fascist themes and key rhetorical commonplaces that are unmistakably associated with fascist rhetoric”.
Crick wrote that the fascist overtones came in the videos’ reliance “on conspiracy theory motifs, most consistently the theme of dark, hidden forces at work behind the scenes”. He also noted a “fixation on sexual perversity and demasculinization”, the “delegitimization of the current state as hopelessly corrupt”, and the “consistent ‘dark’ tone of the videos, the atmosphere of present ‘carnage’ that requires major overhaul”.
Skinnell wrote that the fascist themes included the “invention of a glorious, mythic past” and the “utopian vision of a future cleansed of infiltrators and corrupters”. He also cited “narratives of crisis and decline” and “the complementary narrative of victimization at the hands of degenerates and ‘globalists’”.
Both qualified these claims, saying the videos lacked some elements of full-blown fascist rhetoric.
Noting that “it’s important to distinguish generally ‘conservative’ views from fascism proper”, Crick said that the material on foreign policy, even when touting the “America first” slogan, was “boilerplate political realism”.
Skinnell pointed to the videos being “ambiguous about the ‘one true leader’”, which is central to fascist rhetoric, adding that while Trump was presented positively, “in fascist rhetoric, the leader is the embodiment of the nation’s fundamental values”.
He also said the videos “don’t lean into the violence or domination narratives that power fascist rhetoric”."

The court said on November 11 that the charge stemmed from the ICC's issuance of arrest warrants for former Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and armed forces' Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov.
Mahfoudh and his ICC colleagues, Rosario Salvatore Aitala and Sergio Gerardo Ugalde Godinez, issued the arrest warrants for Shoigu and Gerasimov in late June for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Ukraine after the start of Russia's unprovoked invasion of its neighbor in 2022.
According to the ICC judges, Shoigu and Gerasimov were responsible for Russian missile strikes conducted between October 2022 and at least March 9, 2023, against Ukraine's energy infrastructure.
RFE/RL's Ukraine Live Briefing gives you the latest developments on Russia's invasion, Western military aid, the plight of civilians, and territorial control maps. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.
The ICC statement issued at the time said that ""the expected incidental civilian harm and damage would have been clearly excessive to the anticipated military advantage"" for those who ordered the strikes.
Shoigu was dismissed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in May. He now heads Putin's Security Council.
Earlier last year, Russian authorities added Aitala, along with ICC Judge Tomoko Akane and Prosecutor Karim Khan to their wanted list after they issued arrest warrants in March 2023 for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russia's children's commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, for being responsible for the deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia following the invasion -- a war crime under international legislation.
Russia retaliated by opening criminal cases against the ICC officials.

Global leaders committed to curb the death toll from antibiotic-resistant infections by 10 per cent by 2030 during the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) meeting Thursday in New York.
The political declaration set the global agenda on antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which occurs when bacteria and fungi evolve to the point where they can evade drugs.
These so-called superbugs emerge when people overuse antibiotics in medicine, and animal and crop farming, and they can leave hospitals with few options to treat infections.
AMR contributed to 4.95 million deaths in 2019, and health experts say more than 39 million people could die from antibiotic-resistant infections by 2050.
The new agreement says that by 2030, every country should implement a national action plan to combat AMR that spans the government, farming industry, and health sector. So far, 11 per cent of countries have dedicated funding in their national budgets to implement these plans, the document says.
It also set a fundraising target of $100 million (€90.2 million) to support low and middle-income countries, which are disproportionately affected by AMR, as they ramp up their national plans.
The agreement is a ""strong blueprint for accelerating action against AMR,"" UNGA President Philemon Yang, the former Cameroonian leader, said during the meeting, adding that ""it is important to translate our declarations into concrete action"".
While lower-income countries bear the brunt of AMR, it is a growing health threat around the globe.
In the European Union alone, AMR accounts for at least 33,000 deaths and about €1.5 billion in societal costs every year.
""We need to continue supporting each other and dedicate enough resources to tackle this serious issue,"" EU health chief Stella Kyriakides said on the sidelines of the event.
The EU’s AMR budget is €62 million, she said, and next year it will launch the European Partnership on One Health AMR, which aims to support collaboration between the EU, national agencies, researchers, and funders.
AMR threat similar to the climate crisis
The UNGA last met to discuss AMR in 2016, meaning the new agreement is the first global political action on the issue in nearly a decade.
It calls for animal farms to shift from using antimicrobials to vaccines whenever possible, for drug manufacturers and others to improve their waste management in order to prevent antibiotics from getting into the water supply, and to ensure that at least 80 per cent of countries have the ability to test for antibiotic resistance in bacterial and fungal pathogens by 2030.
Without these efforts, ""AMR could unwind a hundred years of medical progress, making conditions that are easily treatable today a death sentence,"" Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization (WHO), told journalists.
Even with the agreement, however, advocates may face challenges in strengthening the global AMR response, given the UN declaration was watered down during months of government negotiations this spring.
For example, an earlier draft included a plan to reduce antimicrobials in animal farming by 30 per cent, but the final version includes a more vague commitment.
Barbados’ prime minister Mia Mottley, who chairs a global leadership group on AMR, told journalists that one of the agreement’s strengths is the plan to create an independent scientific advisory group that would consult with countries as they make changes to tackle AMR.
""We need everybody to make a change in this,"" Mottley said, comparing the AMR threat to the climate crisis.
Mottley also emphasised the need for pharmaceutical companies to develop new antibiotic drugs. Around the turn of the century, there were more than 20 companies doing this research, she said, but that number has dwindled to four today.
""If we don't find the money to do the research"" to bring new antibiotics to the market, ""then we are going to see more and more people dying,"" Mottley said."

The world was thrown into chaos when a new virus, Covid-19, was declared a pandemic by the government. Fear propaganda was broadcasted non-stop on television and radio, all paid for by the government and they used the pandemic as an excuse to pass laws that restricted civil liberties and bribed the public with furlough payments to not go to work.
As the pandemic progressed, the government’s true motives were revealed, as they were found to be putting vulnerable individuals into end-of-life care and administering a drug called midazolam to kill them, while lying to the public by claiming that their deaths were due to the virus.
The consequences of vaccination were also revealed as it was not actually a vaccine, but an experimental gene therapy that had never been used on humans before; and not without good reason.
Tragically, as things began to settle, the true consequences of the Covid-19 injection roll-out were realised.
The fully vaccinated accounted for over 9 in every 10 deaths associated with the virus, and mortality rates per 100,000 were lowest among the unvaccinated and highest among the vaccinated in every age group.
Two years after the initial roll-out, 20 million deaths had been recorded in the “Five Eyes” countries and 26 other countries in Europe, resulting in 2 million excess deaths. This was a huge increase on deaths recorded throughout the pandemic prior to the vaccine roll-out.
In Europe, there was a huge increase in excess deaths among children aged 0 to 14, as soon as the vaccine was approved for children by the EMA. The very “vaccine” that was supposed to protect them had the opposite effect, and many parents were left devastated after falling for the coercive lies which resulted in the loss of their children’s lives.
Meanwhile, by week 40 of 2022 in the USA, half a million deaths among children and young adults were recorded following the Covid-19 injection roll-out, resulting in 120,000 excess deaths. This highlights the severe impact that the vaccine had on the young and healthy and the devastating loss of life caused by the vaccine.

The world was thrown into chaos when fear propaganda began to be broadcasted non-stop on television and radio, all paid for by the government.
They claimed that a new virus called Covid-19 was causing a pandemic and persuaded the public to go into lockdown multiple times through fear porn and bribes such as furlough payments to not go to work.
Do you remember the scenes broadcast on mainstream news channels, and plastered across the front pages at the start of 2020?
Infamous images of Chinese medical officials in hazmat suits collecting bodies off the pavements of Wuhan, where we were told they had collapsed and died in the street because of a new strain of coronavirus, now known as COVID-19.
The scenes have not been replicated anywhere else, confirming that it was all a lie and propaganda, used to whip up hysteria and justify the introduction of medical tyranny across the world, in the name of preventing the spread of COVID-19.
Nevertheless, the vast majority of the general public fell for the propaganda and were left feeling trapped and alone, as they watched their livelihoods and savings disappear.
Mental health issues skyrocketed, and children were left feeling hopeless as they watched their parents struggle. So hopeless that they were attempting suicide due to unsubstantiated fears of Covid-19 fueled by the Government’s fear propaganda.
An NHS doctor has revealed that he was seeing children as young as eight self-harming and attempting suicide amid what had become an unprecedented mental health crisis fuelled by the stress caused by months of lies pedalled by the Government and the mainstream media in relation to the alleged Covid-19 pandemic.
Consultant Dave Greenhorn confirmed that back in March 2021, he and fellow NHS staff at Bradford Royal Infirmary were regularly seeing youngsters who had attempted suicide or taken overdoses due to the stress of being terrified of family members catching Covid-19.
Commenting at the time, Dr Greenhorn said –
“We [NHS staff] have seen all sorts of tragic things that we haven’t seen before”.
“A year of lockdown is a massive amount of time when you’re so young and you can’t see your friends and combine that with other things such as parents on furlough, working from home or losing their jobs,”
“The children don’t have the emotive language to discuss why they feel the way they do, they just know that they feel awful.”Source
The government also used the pandemic as an excuse to pass laws that restricted civil liberties, such as banning public gatherings, limiting travel, and increasing surveillance.
As the pandemic continued, investigators uncovered the horrifying truth that the government had been putting elderly and vulnerable individuals into end-of-life care and administering a drug called midazolam to kill them, while lying to the public by claiming that their deaths were due to the virus.
You gave up two years of your life due to a lie. But not just any lie, a lie that involved prematurely ending the lives of thousands upon thousands of people, who you were told died of Covid-19.
A lie that involved committing one of the greatest crimes against humanity in living memory. A lie that required just three things – fear, your compliance, and a drug known as Midazolam.
During April 2020 out-of-hospital prescribing for Midazolam was twice the amount seen in 2019.
There are many factors to understand when it comes to the Midazolam scandal, so you can read the full original investigation into this atrocity here.
This revelation left those who had broken free from the hypnotic trance of BBC News feeling betrayed and angry, as they realized that their loved ones had been sacrificed for the government’s own gain.
Many elderly citizens felt targeted and discriminated against by the government’s actions.
When a vaccine was finally invented and rolled out, it was revealed that it was not actually a vaccine, but an experimental gene therapy that had never been used on humans before.
And there was a very good reason for that as explained by Dr Anthony Fauci, the Chief Medical Advisor to the President of the United States at the time. in the following footage –
Many people were hesitant to take the vaccine. Still, they were pressured and coerced by the government, media and big players such as Bill Gates, Dr Fauci, Chris Whitty, Matt Hancock and other government officials who were heavily bribed by the Pharmaceutical companies and were also found to be shareholders of the vaccine manufacturing companies.
They used the fear of the virus and the threat of fines, loss of jobs, and lack of freedom to coerce people into getting vaccinated.
Tragically, the fully vaccinated accounted for over 9 in every 10 deaths associated with the virus…
And once things began to settle down the true consequences of the mass Covid-19 vaccine roll-out were realised.
Mortality rates per 100,000 were lowest among the unvaccinated and highest among the vaccinated in every single age-group. And many people who had taken the vaccine, and finally joined the millions of others who had broken free from the hypnotic trance of BBC News were left feeling guilty and ashamed, as they realized that they had unknowingly put themselves in harm’s way.
You can read a full investigation into the devastating mortality rates here.
Two years after the initial roll-out, 20 million deaths had been recorded in the “Five Eyes” countries and 26 other countries in Europe, resulting in nearly 2 million excess deaths.
This was a huge increase on deaths recorded throughout the pandemic prior to the vaccine roll-out. Especially when we consider the fact that we still do not have the data for the entirety of 2022.
For example, Australia suffered 11,068 excess deaths in 2021 and then a shocking 22,730 excess deaths by week 38 of 2022. This is in stark contrast to 2020, when only 1,306 excess deaths were recorded at the height of the Covid pandemic and prior to the rollout of the Covid injections.
This means Australia suffered a shocking 1,640% increase in excess deaths in just 39 weeks throughout 2022 compared to 53 weeks throughout 2020.
Children were also affected, with a huge increase in excess deaths occurring among 0 to 14-year-olds in Europe as soon as the vaccine was approved for children by the European Medicines Agency.
The Expose’s investigation into these shocking statistics forced the EU to launch a Europe-wide investigation into why so many children were dying.
But that investigation has still failed to reach a conclusion.
Meanwhile, in the USA, half a million deaths among children and young adults were recorded following the vaccine roll-out, resulting in 120,000 excess deaths. Parents were left feeling devastated as they lost their children to the very thing that they were falsely told was supposed to protect them.
Three years on from the start of the initial pandemic, the world has found itself in a cost of living crisis due to extreme inflation caused by printing money throughout the pandemic.
Excess deaths are at an all-time high all around the world and show no signs of slowing down.
The government’s response has been an utter failure, and many people have been left feeling betrayed and hopeless.
Hundreds of thousands are now left questioning how they could have been so gullible, to follow the government’s orders without question.
The whole thing had been a disaster from start to finish.
Society is in deep shock, confusion and despair, with the people struggling to come to terms with the scale of the corruption and the cost of it.
Government officials have been found to be heavily bribed by the Pharmaceutical companies and have also been found to be shareholders of the vaccine manufacturing companies.
Take the new Prime Minister of the UK for instance. Rishi Sunak officially became Prime Minister on October 31st 2022. And look what happened to Moderna’s share price as soon as that happened.
It bounced back from the never-ending decline it has been suffering throughout the year and has risen ever since. Why?
Because Rishi Sunak’s company ‘Theleme’ is one of the largest shareholders in Moderna.
Sunak was a hedge fund manager before he became a Member of Parliament and later Chancellor of the Exchequer, and he founded and worked at Theleme Partners LLP, a hedge fund management company based in London, UK.
In 2011, Theleme was one of the earliest investors in Moderna, when Moderna only had about ten employees. Fast-forward 11 years and you will find that Theleme is now the 6th largest shareholder in Moderna, and Moderna is the largest holding of Theleme, with 6.3 million shares held as of June 2022.
Is it just a coincidence that within two months of Sunak’s Premiership, his Government announced that they had cemented a 10-year-partnership with Moderna in what it hailed as a “major boost for vaccines and research”.
This 10-year deal struck with Moderna stinks of corruption and it is lining the pockets of the former UK Prime Minister at a cost to both the British Taxpayers’ wallets/purses and their health.
And it is just one of the dozens of examples that prove the Establishment orchestrated the whole Covid-19 pandemic to suit their financial benefit.
These facts alone should disgust and anger the majority of the public. The only problem is, the vast majority haven’t realized it was all a lie. And, sadly, we’re not sure they ever will.

3578,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-10-08,"LGBTQ+ women face disproportionate rates of mental health issues and barriers to care
A leading national survey finds that 22% of LGBTQ+ women respondents have attempted suicide, and 66% reported seeking treatment for trauma.
“The trauma burden in this community is enormous,” said Jaime Grant, one of the researchers who conducted the survey.
These findings are included in a report released Tuesday from the Urvashi Vaid National LGBTQ+ Women’s Community Survey, named after the late lesbian activist. The report comes from analysis of a national survey of 5,000 LGBTQ+ respondents who previously or currently identify as a woman, conducted between June 2021 and June 2022.
The analysis finds that LGBTQ+ women experience substantial health disparities, mental illness and barriers to care.
These findings come more than a decade after Grant’s earlier research found that transgender people had attempted suicide at a rate nine times higher than the national average. Grant, who also led the National Transgender Discrimination Survey in 2011, said those data helped improve medical treatment for transgender people. She hopes this report will do the same for LGBTQ+ women.
If you or someone you know may be considering suicide, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing 9-8-8, or the Crisis Text Line by texting HOME to 741741.
The survey found that respondents experience higher rates of mental illness than the general population. Nearly half of respondents live with anxiety (44%) or depression (51%). The National Association on Mental Illness reports 19% of U.S. adults have an anxiety disorder and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports 18% of U.S. adults have depression. The survey also found differences among race — respondents of color reported higher rates of disability and attempted suicide.
“It’s distressing to see such high trauma rates, but it’s consistent with what we’ve seen in the past,” says Christina Dyar, an assistant professor at the Ohio State University who studies health disparities in LGBTQ+ communities and wasn’t involved in this report.
Under-utilization of health care system
The survey also sought to identify barriers to health care for LGBTQ+ women. Research shows that 77% of the U.S. population has a primary care physician, but just over half of LGBTQ+ women in the survey reported being under the care of one. Respondents of color were twice as likely to say they lacked access to quality health care.
Respondents cited cost and discrimination as the leading reasons for why they put off or didn’t seek out medical care when they were sick or in need. Dyar says there’s been limited research done to determine what exactly limits access to care for LGBTQ+ women. “These numbers are great to have.”
“Historically, medical spaces have not been safe for us,” says Savy Elahian, who led the data analysis for this report and serves as a program coordinator with the National LGBTQ Institute of Intimate Partner Violence.
“There’s been experimentation [on people], there’s been medical racism. It’s important to understand the historical impacts, especially for LGBTQ+ people of color.”
Elahian says the medical field is behind on understanding how to fully serve LGBTQ+ people, which can leave patients feeling unaffirmed and uncomfortable. This discomfort can impact how likely it is they’ll return to a provider when they’re in need, which can be especially dangerous when thinking about preventative care.
According to the survey, 14% of respondents had never had a pap smear and all respondents were nearly twice as likely to have cervical cancer than women in the general U.S. population. A 2022 study found that nearly 1 in 3 lesbian, gay, and bisexual women were overdue on cervical cancer screenings.
“LGBTQ+ women and gender-diverse people are really missing out on preventative care and holistic wellness,” says Elahian. While community-oriented care can help address certain health disparities, community centers and organizations can sometimes lack sufficient resources.
“[LGBTQ+ people] still need to operate in these larger health systems,” they add. “It’s a bit inevitable.”
Institutional change and community care
Report authors Grant and Elahian say they hope the medical field will learn from these findings.
“This is powerful data that people need to listen to,” Elahian said, “from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to doctor’s offices to medical universities.”
Grant noted how the 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey and follow-up surveys helped to put numbers to suffering, reshape medical school curricula, and served as a model and resource for other researchers. She hopes the same thing will happen here.
While the Urvashi Vaid National LGBTQ+ Women’s Community Survey has been led by community activists and researchers, it’s moving to a more prominent organization in an effort to boost its reach and impact. The survey will now be housed at the National Center for Lesbian Rights, the group announced on Tuesday.
“This is enormous for us,” says Imani Rupert-Gordon, the organization’s president. “We aren’t able to fully advocate for our community if we don’t know what’s happening in our community.”
The Center, which serves as a litigation organization, will look to include the survey’s findings in their policy recommendations.
Grant and her team want these findings to go beyond just the doctor’s office and courtroom, though. “This data needs to go to our own people, so they can know the current state of our health,” says Elahian. To do that, they’ve made the findings free and accessible to all and hope to disseminate the research through LGBTQ+ community groups.
Dyar emphasizes community-led surveys are often more accessible and tend to reach more respondents. Academic health disparity research “often ends up behind a paywall,” she says. “It can be really frustrating when our findings don’t get out there.”
Elahian hopes that community education will foster people’s ability to self-advocate in medical settings -- yet another example of how community support helps strengthen this resilient group."

[EPA-EFE/Maria Senovilla] Euractiv is part of the Trust Project >>> Languages: BulgarianPrint Email Facebook X LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram Seeing the military patrol handing out call-up papers on the outskirts of Kyiv, one man slipped into a nearby store. Another refused to even stop for the officers. Others, however, quietly obliged. While men may be coming round to Ukraine’s ramped-up mobilisation drive to replenish troop numbers more than 28 months since Russia’s invasion, they are less eager to fight than before, said a draft officer, who uses the call sign “Fantomas”. “Now, as far as I know, most of the queues (at draft offices) are people who want to obtain some sort of exemption (from fighting),” said the 36-year-old, who was accompanied by Reuters on a recent draft patrol in the Ukrainian capital. The combat veteran is on the front lines of the effort to redouble the draft despite waning public enthusiasm for wartime service as military analysts describe regenerating troop manpower as one of Kyiv’s central battlefield challenges. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy lowered the draft age to 25 from 27 in April and signed off on an overhaul of the mobilisation process that entered force in May, obliging men under 60 to renew their personal data at draft offices or online. Though recruitment numbers remain shrouded in wartime secrecy, some political and military officials have said the changes, including a campaign to increase voluntary recruitment, have got the mobilisation effort back on track after two months. The Ukrainian military told Reuters in a written statement that the conscription rate had more than doubled in May and June compared to the previous two months, without providing the figures. Spokesperson Bohdan Senyk described that as a “positive trend”. The average age of a mobilised soldier remained unchanged at around 40. Demobilisation Strengthened by long-delayed Western aid, Ukraine’s forces have struggled for months to hold the line against Russian troops inching forward in the east. Many weary troops are desperate to be replaced after more than two years of virtually non-stop service with no clarity on when they will be demobilized from an armed forces of around 1 million. Asked about a figure of 200,000 additional troops cited in a German newspaper, Roman Kostenko, secretary of parliament’s national defence committee estimated that the military could enlist that many by the year’s end if the process continued at its current pace. That, he said, could allow Ukraine to consider legislation to demobilize some troops, though the interior minister warned doing so without replacing a proportional share of them could weaken the front. Mathieu Boulègue, a defence analyst for the Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis, said the 200,000 estimate was encouraging but that the more critical task would be training them and distributing them to the front correctly. Ukraine needs to “invest human capital smartly and efficiently where it is needed. Because in as much as you can get anyone to drive a truck or clean toilets, you can’t get effective warfighters that easily,” he said. Russia, meanwhile, is recruiting around 30,000 troops per month for its war effort while suffering “very high” losses, a senior NATO official said on Tuesday. He added that Moscow lacked the munitions and troops to start a major offensive. Public misgivings Since the mobilisation overhaul, some draft offices have struggled to cope with the influx of men who have come to register or update their data by the 16 July deadline. “More people are coming than we are able to accept,” said a deputy head of the draft office where Fantomas works. “Sometimes processing drags on to 1 o’clock at night.” The official, who requested anonymity, echoed Fantomas and said a “very, very big” portion of men were seeking exemptions, though he insisted things were on track. “We’re fulfilling our assigned tasks. I wouldn’t say to 100%, but not bad.” Reports of draft corruption and social media footage of scuffles between recruiters and citizens soured the public mood in the lead-up to the springtime rule changes. In an April survey commissioned by public broadcaster Suspilne, around 50% of Ukrainians said they believed mobilisation was going poorly, and 60% said they had a negative perception of draft offices. Facing public opposition, lawmakers stopped short of pushing through more severe sanctions against draft-dodgers as part of the overhaul. Fantomas, who was wounded in eastern Ukraine last year, said 70% of his interactions with people he approaches on the street are positive. He and other military officials have said conflicts such as those captured on film are rare, often torn out of context and exploited by pro-Russian accounts to discredit recruiters, but have been successful in blunting enthusiasm. He admitted he had once been attacked on patrol, but said he refused to fight back for fear of being caught on camera. “The one part where I would be defending myself would make it into a video, and only that would be made to go viral.” Read more with Euractiv Europeans fear US isolationism as Trump picks JD Vance as running mateFormer US president Donald Trump on Monday (15 July) picked controversial Republican Senator JD Vance, who has openly spoken out in favour of isolationist foreign policies, as vice presidential running mate for his White House bid.

3889,fake,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-04-11,"In a report released on Monday, April 8, the ALA's list shows that most of the entries were challenged based on them promoting gender ideology and including lewd content, including graphic depictions of sexual acts and promotion of sexual promiscuity. These have raised numerous concerns among parents. (Related: TORCHED 'EM: Missouri secretary of state candidate uses flamethrower to burn ""GROOMING"" books in viral video.)
At the very top of the list is the book ""Gender Queer"" by Maia Kobabe, a non-fiction graphic novel depicting Kobabe's coming out as a so-called ""nonbinary"" individual that has drawn flack for depicting a ton of sexually explicit content, including teenagers having oral sex, the use of a sex toy and a girl wearing a breast binder, among other graphic depictions of sex and sexuality.
""Gender Queer"" has been banned in school districts in several states, including Florida and Texas. Kobabe, in an interview, admitted that the memoir was written ""for older teens who were already asking these questions about themselves.""
""I don't recommend this book for kids,"" Kobabe added in the interview.
The second most challenged book is ""All Boys Aren't Blue"" by George M. Johnson, a nonfiction book marketed for teenagers that depicts teenage boys having sex. This book has also been banned in more than two dozen school districts.
The third most challenged book is ""This Book is Gay"" by Juno Dawson, another nonfiction that its author describes as a ""guidebook"" for young people who want to experiment with their sexuality and gender identity.

Of the remaining entries in the top 10, three others were challenged for a combination of LGBTQ and sexually explicit content – ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" by Stephen Chbosky at number four, ""Flamer"" by Mike Curato at number five and ""Let's Talk About It: The Teen's Guide to Sex, Relationships and Being a Human"" by Erika Moen and Matthew Nolan in ninth place.
The four other books in the top 10 list were challenged over concerns about their adult themes, including depictions of rape, incest and other sexually explicit content.
In defense of its promotion of LGBTQ-themed books in libraries all over the country, the ALA has claimed that the ""censorship"" of these books in children's libraries is tantamount to discrimination against the LGBTQ community.
""In looking at the titles of the most challenged books from last year, it's obvious that the pressure groups are targeting books about LGBTQIA+ people and people of color,"" claimed ALA President Emily Drabinski in a statement. ""At ALA, we are fighting for the freedom to choose what you want to read. Shining a light on the harmful workings of these pressure groups is one of the actions we must take to protect our right to read.""
In its report regarding the most challenged books of 2023, the ALA further claimed that the number of books targeted for so-called ""censorship"" rose by 65 percent in 2023 compared to the year before, making it the highest recorded number of annual book bans.
""These are books that contain the ideas, opinions and the voices that censors want to silence – stories by and about LGBTQ+ persons and people of color,"" claimed ALA Office for Intellectual Freedom Director Deborah Caldwell-Stone. ""Each challenge, each demand to censor these books is an attack on our freedom to read, our right to live the life we choose and an attack on libraries as community institutions that reflect the rich diversity of our nation.""
The ALA's strong opposition to banning books that contain explicit material has led to it being accused of becoming an institution that effectively defends pornography in children's libraries.
This has led to state libraries in Montana, Missouri and Texas severing all ties with the ALA. State lawmakers in several other states are championing similar measures to prevent the ALA's influence from seeping into their libraries.

3433,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-02-20,"The first study of its kind has looked into how the digital divide affects the LGBTI community.
The digital divide is a “vicious cycle” for the LGBTI community around the world, despite the online space also being revolutionary in spearheading movements, according to a rights group.
The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Intersex Association (ILGA) released a report on Tuesday looking into the community’s disparities in digital access, claiming it is the first to conduct a global review of the digital divide for the LGBTI community.
Those in the community who suffer from the digital divide, which is unequal access to laptops and devices that connect to the Internet, could not access important information such as health data nor a supportive online community, the study found.
“Access to a community is what gives most of us strength. Knowing that you’re not the only one and there’s someone else who is working alongside you on this journey is where we derive most of our strength from, especially as leaders,” said one study participant in Uganda.
The report also found that there were concerns about harassment online, which participants said tech companies could do more to solve.
“The digital divide affects everyone. For LGBTI people, the digital divide is an issue of also facing hostile legislation and very specific barriers,” said Daniele Paletta, communications manager for ILGA.
He told Euronews Next it is a “vicious cycle,” as those who may not have access to education or who drop out of school due to discrimination may not have the means to access the Internet.
This leads to fewer opportunities to access higher education or jobs, making them more likely to live in poverty.

The Internet is crucial for those who need to navigate their way through legislation and surveillance, such as the risks in some countries of being on a dating app.
In Southwest Asia and North Africa “there are many instances of entrapment, blackmail and abuse from police and dating apps and social,” said Paletta, adding that in some cases people are prevented from using public wifi and media centres.
Getting to a place with Internet access is another issue as some study participants said that living in rural areas meant they needed to walk to the nearest city, which poses risks of being exposed to violence if a person is visibly perceived as being part of the LGBTI community.
However, having easy access to the Internet can also expose people to harassment online.
“Social media platforms are where most of these harms happen,” said one participant in Uganda.
“But somehow content moderation is not taken as seriously, and people who are doing content moderation are also not working in great conditions, so they aren’t able to do their work as effectively.”
The European Digital Media Observatory (EDMO) said in a report in May 2023 that anti-LGBTQ misinformation and disinformation is on the rise and ""often incites hate against minorities, laws and institutions"".
While some social media companies do moderate content, Paletta said they can be slow to respond to reports of harassment.
Another issue is that while some people can leave a platform, such as X (formerly Twitter), which has been slammed for firing its content moderators after Elon Musk took over the company, many users from certain countries do not have that luxury because it is still a very big and important platform to be on, Paletta said.
“Sometimes there is really the feeling that these companies created something [and]they're not really, able to grasp what they have now created,” he added.
“There's a need for collaborative efforts between governments, NGOs and technology companies, I think to understand what what can really work,” Paletta advised.
'We can go without connections'
Another way to improve the digital divide and social media platforms is more funding to LGBTI organisations and for digital inclusion initiatives, the study advises.
But some interviewees mentioned that while internet connectivity and resources are important, for some LGBTI organisations, this is not always the most pressing need.
“I know the Internet is very important, but the lives of our people on land are more important than connectivity. We can go without connections,” one association in Tonga said.
“But if we aren’t able to serve our people, nationally, how can we connect overseas, and when they don’t have the energy, when they don’t have the freedom to talk.”
The study, in participation with the non-profit organisation The Engine Room, was conducted with representatives of ILGA’s Latin America and the Caribbean, Pan Africa, Europe, Asia, and Oceania regional offices and governing bodies.
The study noted its limitations such as potential sources of bias and gaps in available data and that not all the interviewees have LGBTI populations as their primary focus."
3959,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-09-02,"AAP FACTCHECK – The father of Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelif has said she is transgender, social media posts claim.
This is false. Amar Khelif has said she was born and raised female and has never said his daughter is transgender.
The Algerian boxer was the subject of intense scrutiny during the Paris Olympics, leading to many claims about her gender identity.
“Imane Khelif’s Father Breaks Silence on the 2024 Olympic Boxing Champion’s Gender Identity – ‘She Is Transgender, Not a Boy’ Amid Rising Speculation,” one of the Facebook posts reads.
Many posts feature a photo of Khelif’s father, Amar, in which he is showing an image of his daughter as a child on his phone.
The interview with Mr Khelif was conducted by Reuters news agency.
In the interview, he does not describe his daughter as transgender. Instead, he recalls her growing up as a “little girl” and he repeatedly refers to her as female.
“My child is a girl. She was raised a girl. She is a strong girl,” he said in the interview.
The photo used in the posts is also incorrectly captioned. One of the children pictured next to Mr Khelif is labelled “Imane”.
However, the child pictured is actually one of Imane Khelif’s younger siblings.
The photo, from Getty Images dated August 2, 2024, is captioned: “The father of Algerian boxer Imane Khelif, shows a picture of his daughter as a child as he sits accompanied by his two young children in the family home”.
Khelif filed a cyberbullying lawsuit in France after winning gold in the women’s 66kg division, naming billionaire Elon Musk and author JK Rowling among her alleged abusers.

5319,real,ANTI_MIGRATION_AND_XENOPHOBIA,2024-10-16,"Giorgia Meloni’s conservative government has begun sending illegal migrants from Italy to offshore processing detention centres in Albania, with the maiden ship setting sail from the island of Lampedusa and arriving on Wednesday.
Ten Egyptian and six Bengali migrants were removed from Italy aboard the naval Libra patrol ship on Monday on a journey to the port town of Shengjin in northwestern Albania, docking at the town on Wednesday morning.
“The first ship that will take irregular migrants to the repatriation centres set up in Albania has left Lampedusa,” Brothers of Italy MP Sara Kelany said per Il Giornale as it departed. “We have built a replicable and effective model to manage clandestine arrivals, alleviate the migratory pressure on Italy and strengthen our internal security.”
The migrant removals mark the fruition of a long-awaited plan from the Meloni government in Rome, which negotiated a deal with Tirana to house up to 36,000 migrants per year in detention centres.
The €670 million ($730m/£560m) five-year deal will allow migrants to be held offshore while their asylum claims are processed rather than allowing the illegals to remain in Italy. While the centres will be in Albania, Italy will still be responsible for security, and the properties will technically remain under Italian jurisdiction.
Under the scheme, migrants will be held for up to four weeks in the detention centres. Should Italian authorities deem them worthy of asylum, they will be transferred to migrant centres in Italy. However, should their claims be determined to be spurious, they will be sent back to their country of origin.
Rome hopes that sending migrants directly to Albania will deter further attempts to reach their shores by aliens, even though it is unlikely that all illegals will be removed under the scheme.
The Meloni government initially faced criticism for failing to live up to its hardline campaign stances on illegal immigration, such as a promise to impose a naval blockade in the Mediterranean to prevent illegal crossings, which never came to pass.
However, Meloni’s multi-pronged approach to the crisis—including crafting deals with African nations and clamping down on ‘migrant taxi’ NGO ships—has begun to pay off. According to Interior Ministry figures, illegal migration has decreased by over 61 per cent this year compared to 2023.
Should the Albanian plan also prove successful, it could serve to embarrass the Labour Party government in Britain, which scrapped a similar scheme with Rwanda as one of its first acts after coming to power in July. The Albanian model is also reportedly being considered in Brussels as a potential framework for the EU to handle illegal migration into the bloc.
The removal of illegals has been criticised by globalist institutions, with Amnesty International saying that it has “strong concern about possible violations of human rights related to the measures provided for by the protocol, in particular, with regard to generalized detention, automatic detention and search and rescue operations at sea, considering it a violation, by Italy, of its international obligations.”"
5602,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-11-16,"Against the backdrop of Baku’s COP29 climate negotiations, the shores of the Caspian Sea are retreating.
All eyes are on Azerbaijan as the small petrostate hosts COP29 in its capital Baku, which sits on the shores of the Caspian Sea - the largest inland body of water on Earth.
The Caspian Sea, sometimes called the world’s biggest lake, lies between Europe and Asia.
Bounded by Kazakhstan, Russia, Turkmenistan, Iran and COP29 hosts Azerbaijan, the sea is shrinking. And according to local experts, climate change is partly to blame.
The Caspian Sea has shrunk by ""catastrophic"" levels, says Azerbaijan's president
The Caspian Sea has a surface area of 371,000 square km - approximately equivalent to the size of Japan. But Azerbaijan’s National Hydrometeorology Service says the levels of the Caspian Sea have dropped by three metres since 1995.
Discussing the issue with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in August - the sea is bordered by Russia to its north - the country's president Ilham Aliyev was reported to have described the situation as “catastrophic”.
Water levels have dipped so dramatically that a medieval fortress, Sabayil Castle, long submerged by a 14th-century earthquake, is now visible above the waves.
The nearby Garabogazköl lagoon, connected to the Caspian Sea by a narrow strait, once previously dried up when water flow from the Caspian was blocked in the 1980s, but has since been restored.
Is the climate crisis causing the Caspian Sea to shrink?
Rovshan Abbasov, an associate professor of geographic sciences at Baku's Khazar University, says a number of factors are impacting the sea's water levels, including humans using water from the rivers that flow into the sea, and climate change impacting weather patterns.
""The current retreat has deeper roots. The rivers flowing into the Caspian are contributing less water than before,"" explains Abbasov. ""For instance, the flow of the Kura River is decreasing due to the impacts of climate change. In the Volga River basin, rainfall is not as abundant as it used to be. This also leads to a decline.""
Nazim Mahmudhov, head of the country's National Hydrometeorology Service, says climate change is one of the main factors affecting the water levels.
“The ongoing climate changes have led to a decrease in the water levels of the rivers flowing into the sea, as well as an increase in evaporation due to global warming. All these factors have had a significant impact.”
Decreasing water levels are impacting fish populations
Vugar Abdullayev, chairman of the Baku Fishermen and Underwater Hunters Club, says the shoreline has receded by 10 to 20 metres in the last decade.
“We are currently standing in the water, but if it were 10 years ago, we would be 10 to 20 metres further inside the Caspian Sea from the shoreline where we stand now,” he says. “However, due to global warming and the retreat of the Caspian Sea, we are now forced to cast our nets farther out to catch fish as the water continues to recede.”
He claims that a massive die-off of fish this summer was caused by rising temperatures leading to a lack of oxygen.
“This summer, we witnessed mass die-offs of fish multiple times. Some people said they were poisoned, but that’s not the case. It was not a poisoning issue at all. Due to the rising air temperatures, the water heats up more, which reduces the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water,” he explains.
“As the oxygen percentage decreases, the fish struggle to breathe and, as a result, jump out of the water onto the shore in large numbers,” adds Abdullayev.
The wildlife that depend on the Caspian Sea for life
Because of its size, the Caspian Sea provides a diverse habitat to flora and fauna. Parts of the inland lake freeze over in winter, while its islands feature gazelles, spur-thighed tortoises, and birds designated to Important Bird Regions.
One hundred years ago, the sea was home to more than one million seals; but now fewer than 10 per cent of this figure remains."
3063,fake,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-06-19,"Editor’s note: The following article is Part I of a two-part series on U.S. influence in Ukraine and its relationship with the neo-Nazi Azov Battalion. Part II can be found HERE.
(LifeSiteNews) — The news that the Biden administration has lifted a ban on funding the neo-Nazi Azov Battalion is simply business as usual for a regime which changes names and definitions to suit itself.
The news should come as no surprise.
Despite the apparent U-turn, the U.S. seems to have been training Azov – and battalions like it – since 2015.
When reports reached the U.S. about this, via the Daily Beast, an amendment was quickly passed in July 2015 which “[p]rohibits funds provided by this bill from being used to provide arms, training, or other assistance to the Azov Battalion.”
The amendment was made to a bill proposing funding to Ukraine, the May 19, 2015, Department of Defense Appropriations Act (HR 5293).
However, in January 2016 this ban was lifted. As The Nation reported:
Under pressure from the Pentagon, Congress has stripped the spending bill of an amendment that prevented funds from falling into the hands of Ukrainian neo-fascist groups.
In 2018, Congress again stipulated that U.S. aid money could not be used to support Azov. As The Hill reported on the spending bill at the time:
… the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill signed into law last week stipulates that ‘none of the funds made available by this act may be used to provide arms, training or other assistance to the Azov Battalion.’
It is this latest “ban” that the Biden admin has now “quietly dropped” – following sustained lobbying from the Department of Defense. Yet with a 70-plus-year history of the U.S. backing Ukrainian nationalists to fight a war against Russia, this should come as no surprise.
History in the making
Since the beginning of this war, history has been erased, ignored, or simply rewritten. Even the beginning of the war being in 2014 and not 2022 is not widely known. Nor are the circumstances which led to it.
This is normal during and after wars. And so it is also normal that an obviously neo-Nazi battalion – formerly one of dozens of private armies run by oligarchs – is not in fact a neo-Nazi battalion.
This is part of the wider process of the transitioning of our reality to a post-sane politics, where the obvious is false, ruin is a sort of rescue, and everything evil is in fact good for you.
The transitioning of reality
The Hyatt Hotels heiress Penny Pritzker was announced on June 10 as the U.S. State Department’s Special Representative for Ukraine’s Economic Recovery. The Pritzkers are best known for aggressively backing the transgender cult, with one of the family having “transitioned” himself, and another – as Governor of Illinois – being the first to promote what investigative Jennifer Bilek calls “Synthetic Sex Identities” in U.S. schools.
Just as the Pritzkers work to “transition” your children for profit, so does the State Department seek to identify its policies as sane and healthy – when they monetize orchestrated misery.
Ukraine does not have a functioning economy without massive and continued U.S. financial support. It has lost its industrial base and most of its coastline. It has lost much of its farmland. The U.S. has rejected outright an offer of a negotiated peace by Russia made this month, preferring instead to pursue a war through proxies such as the Azov Battalion and others like them.
All of these “neo-Nazi” battalions have a curious origin. Just like the “transgender” industry in the U.S., they were all backed by billionaires. When the Western media first reported on them in 2014, they were rightly seen as threat to the Ukrainian government itself, as well as Ukraine’s “greatest weapon.”
That is because they were not controlled by the Ukrainian state. They were one of many private armies run by oligarchs. Consistently opposed to peace, and vehemently anti-Russian, their partnership with the State Department of Antony Blinken and Victoria Nuland has seen their power eclipse that of their former president – the actor Volodymyr Zelensky. They have been recognized as a threat to Ukrainian state power for a decade.
Founding of the oligarchs’ private armies
The Azov Battalion was founded in 2014 with money and support from Igor Kolomoisky. He is described as a “Ukrainian-born Israeli-Cypriot” on Wikipedia. He identifies as Ukrainian. He lives in Tel Aviv. In 2019, the FBI was investigating him for financial crimes. Kolomoisky also had his own private army – “The Dnipro Battalion.”
Kolomoisky used this army to invade the Kiev headquarters of Ukrainian gas company UkrTransNafta in March 2015 in a “night raid” reported by Reuters.
He was attempting to seize control of the company, which he said had been “stolen” from him by the government. You can see him come out from the building and swear at reporters immediately after his troops had occupied the building here:
Kolomoisky owns the TV station which broadcasted Zelensky’s TV show, “Servant of the People.” In this show, Zelensky plays a nobody who becomes the president of Ukraine.
In season 3 of “Servant of the People,” Zelensky wins the election. At the same time, Zelensky won the real election. The name of his party is “Servant of the People”
Zelensky – who always used to call himself Vladimir Zelensky and was a Russian speaker from birth – is man who now identifies as the president of Ukraine. He has transitioned successfully from a man publicly impersonating the president, and in celebration of this obvious fact all the liberal leaders now respect his pronouns, calling him “Volodymyr Zelyenskyy” and never saying his “deadname.”
Former President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko described Zelensky as a “Kolomoisky puppet.”
In June 2023, investigative journalist George Webb reported that Kolomoisky owned the FBI building in Cleveland, Ohio, and rents it to them.
WoW 😆 AZOV Battalion (Kolomoisky’s private army) founder, Burisma Director & VERY dodgy Ukrainian Oligarch Igor Kolomoisky owns the FBI building in Cleveland. https://t.co/tBezzurrDg
— Craig Summers (@paraskip) June 27, 2023
How does a Jewish “entrepreneur” with FBI ties come to own a private neo-Nazi army? He is not the only one.
30 private ‘Nazi’ armies in Ukraine
This story from Reuters in 2015 documents how oligarchs in Ukraine had raised 30 private armies to defend their own business interests from state control. The original link is now mysteriously dead, but you can still read about how Kolomoisky also backed another battalion – Aidar – which was accused of war crimes against “civilians they were charged with protecting.”
Although all have been brought under the authority of the military or the National Guard, the post-Maidan government is still struggling to control them.
One of the demands of the 2014 U.S.-backed putsch known as the Maidan was to crack down on this power:
When the Maidan protesters overthrew former President Viktor Yanukovich [in 2014], they demanded that the new government clamp down on the oligarchs’ abuse of power.
Instead, many became even more powerful: Kiev handed Kolomoisky and mining tycoon Serhiy Taruta governor posts in important eastern regions of Ukraine, for example.
The Jewish Nazis?
How does the Jewish identity of the owners of these battalions – and of the Ukrainian former president himself – square with the celebration of Nazism?
A report in the Times of Israel explained this in March 2022. These are anti-Russian Nazis, not anti-Jewish Nazis.
Jewish “political consultant” Konstantin Batozsky described his experience working with Azov in 2014-15:
‘They were soccer hooligans and wanted attention, so yeah, I was shocked when I saw guys with swastika tattoos,’ he said about the Azov members he got to know. ‘But I talked with them all the time about being Jewish and they had nothing negative to say. They had no anti-Jewish ideology.’
A second source is given to support this claim. “Daniel Kovzhun, a Jew from Kyiv who ran logistics during the war in Donetsk for paramilitary units, described a similar experience.”
“There were Orthodox Jews in Azov,” he said. “I know because I was there on the battle lines. No one cared who was Jewish, we cared about keeping our country together.”
Both men claimed the Russians were antisemitic.
Zelensky’s future Ukraine a ‘big Israel’
In April 2022, Zelensky announced his vision of Ukraine’s future. He said in the Jerusalem Post: “We will definitely become a ‘big Israel’ with its own face.”
This is the transition he plans for Ukraine.
The Institute for Jewish Policy Research says there are 40,000 Jews in Ukraine in a pre-war population of 40 million. Yet the model of Ukraine’s future is the state of Israel, which is currently accused of mass starvation and war crimes. Just like the private armies of the oligarchs, now part of the regular Ukrainian army.
As Reuters reported in 2015: “… private battalions have starved civilians as a form of warfare, preventing aid convoys from reaching separatist-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine, according to [an] Amnesty report.”
Zelensky’s idea of Ukraine as a “big Israel” is that of a nation in a permanent security emergency run by war criminals.
This vision was published by the Atlantic Council, founded in 1961 by the U.S. State Department to strengthen U.S. influence in Europe.
Though funded by U.S. taxpayers, it also receives generous donations from the Rockefeller Foundation, Klaus Schwab’s Schwab Fund, Google, and Goldman Sachs.
The transition of Ukraine from a nation into a permanent state of emergency is backed by billionaires with an agenda of their own.
Zelensky’s promise of peace in 2019
Zelensky was voted into power with a promise of peace. His inaugural speech to the Rada – the Parliament of Ukraine – promised a ceasefire in Donbas and negotiations with the Russians in May 2019.
“However, our first task is ceasefire in the Donbas. I have been often asked: ‘What price are you ready to pay for the ceasefire?’ It’s a strange question. What price are you ready to pay for the lives of your loved ones? I can assure you that I’m ready to pay any price to stop the deaths of our heroes.”
He demanded the return of Crimea, as it was the property of Ukraine. Crimea was gifted to Ukraine by the Ukrainian Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in 1954.
Ninety-seven percent of Crimeans are Russian speakers, and 75 percent said they were Russian – not Ukrainian – in a 2015 report by E-International Relations, which describes itself as “the world’s leading international relations website.”"
6078,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-11-07,"A Chinese-owned electronics plant in Russia's Leningrad region has ceased operations, highlighting the growing impact of Western sanctions on Moscow over its war against Ukraine and the shifting dynamics of foreign business in Russia.
According to a report by the Kommersant newspaper on November 7, TPV Technology, a Hong Kong-based company known as the world's largest manufacturer of computer monitors, halted production at its Shushary facility, which had been assembling TV sets for major brands like Philips, Sony, and Sharp.
The plant in western Russia, operational since 2011, is now in the process of selling off components and equipment.
The closure comes amid increasing concerns over secondary sanctions from the United States and European Union, which have targeted companies -- in particular those from China -- doing business with Russia.
While TPV Technology's Russian branch called the move a ""strategic"" decision to scale down its operations in the country, Kommersant quoted sources as saying the threat of secondary sanctions was likely a key driver behind the decision.
Last month, Washington imposed its latest sanctions, targeting Chinese companies involved in producing complex weapons systems in collaboration with Russian firms.
That marked a new phase in the U.S.-China sanctions relationship, with ripple effects reaching beyond traditional sectors like energy and technology.
Further complicating the situation, Kommersant reported that Chinese banks have increasingly refused to engage in financial transactions with Russia, fearing secondary sanctions.
Around 80 percent of payments from Russia to China in yuan are being returned, signaling the growing reluctance of Chinese financial institutions to take on the risk of U.S. and EU sanctions."
5988,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-10-24,"AMOC collapse would bring severe global climate repercussions, with Europe bearing the brunt of the consequences.
Scientists have warned that the dangers of the collapse of a key Atlantic Ocean current that helps regulate the Earth's climate have been ""greatly underestimated"".
In an open letter published earlier this week, 44 leading climate scientists from 15 countries said that the collapse of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) would have devastating and irreversible impacts. They write that the risks require urgent action from policymakers.
The most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report says there is ""medium confidence"" that the AMOC will not collapse abruptly by 2100. But the group of experts says this is an underestimate.
""The purpose of this letter is to draw attention to the fact that only 'medium confidence' in the AMOC not collapsing is not reassuring, and clearly leaves open the possibility of an AMOC collapse during this century,"" they write in the open letter.
""Even with a medium likelihood of occurrence, given that the outcome would be catastrophic and impacting the entire world for centuries to come, we believe more needs to be done to minimise this risk.""
The letter is addressed to the Nordic Council of Ministers, an intergovernmental forum which aims to promote cooperation among the Nordic countries. It urges policymakers to consider the risks posed by an AMOC collapse and put pressure on governments to stay within Paris Agreement targets.
What is the Atlantic Ocean Circulation?
The AMOC is an important system of ocean currents. It transports warm water, carbon and nutrients north via the Atlantic Ocean where the water cools and sinks into the deep.
This helps to distribute energy around the planet, moving heat through the ocean like a conveyor belt and regulating our climate.
Warm water - more salty due to evaporation - flows north on the surface of the ocean keeping Europe milder than it would otherwise be. When this water cools it sinks because its high salinity increases its density. It then flows back to the southern hemisphere along the bottom of the ocean.
But studies of past episodes of dramatic cooling in Europe over the last 100,000 years suggest melting ice sheets could weaken the AMOC due to changes in salinity and temperature.
Fresh water reduces the saltiness - and therefore the density of the water- on the surface of the ocean. This means less of the surface water sinks, potentially slowing the flow of the current.
Are we heading for a catastrophic tipping point?
Some research has suggested that climate change may be slowing the flow of the current. One study from 2023, based on sea surface temperatures, suggested that a complete collapse could happen between 2025 and 2095.
There is huge uncertainty about how, when or even if this ‘tipping point’ could actually happen, however, and modelling the scenario is tricky. Most previous computer simulations that showed a collapse involved adding huge, unrealistic quantities of fresh water all at once.
In February this year, scientists from Utrecht University in the Netherlands used a complex climate model to simulate the collapse of the AMOC and discovered that it could be closer than previously thought.
The Dutch team used a supercomputer to carry out the most sophisticated modelling so far to look for warning signs of this tipping point. They added water gradually, finding that a slow decline could eventually lead to a sudden collapse over less than 100 years.
Previously, the paper published in February said, an AMOC tipping point was only a “theoretical concept” and its authors found that the rate at which the tipping of this vital current occurred in their modelling was ""surprising"".
But researchers had to run the simulation for more than 2,000 years to get this result and still added significantly more water than is currently entering the ocean as Greenland’s ice sheet melts.
""The research makes a convincing case that the AMOC is approaching a tipping point based on a robust, physically-based early warning indicator,"" said University of Exeter climate scientist Tim Lenton, who wasn't involved in the research, at the time.
""What it cannot (and does not) say is how close the tipping point is because it shows that there is insufficient data to make a statistically reliable estimate of that.""
Lead author of the study, René van Westen also added that there wasn’t enough data to say anything definitive about a potential future AMOC collapse. More research is needed to work out a timeframe - including models that incorporate increasing levels of carbon dioxide and global warming.
“We can only say that we’re heading towards the tipping point and that AMOC tipping is possible.”
Some of the changes seen in the model before the collapse do, however, correspond with changes we’ve seen in the Atlantic Ocean in recent decades.
“When the AMOC loses stability, as we know from the available reconstructions, it is more likely that abrupt transitions may develop in the future,” van Westen added.
Lenton said that we have to ""hope for the best but prepare for the worst"" by investing in more research to improve the estimate of how close a tipping point is, assess the potential impacts and work out how we can manage and adapt to those impacts.
What would a collapse of the ocean current mean for Europe?
If the AMOC collapses, previous research has shown the resulting climate impacts would be nearly irreversible in human timescales. It would mean severe global climate repercussions, with Europe bearing the brunt of the consequences.
Some parts of Europe could see temperatures plunge by up to 30C. On average, the model shows London cooling by 10C and Bergen by 15C.
The report’s authors say that “no realistic adaptation measures can deal with such rapid temperature changes”.
Temperatures in the southern hemisphere would rise with wet and dry seasons in the Amazon rainforest flipping.
Van Westen also explained earlier this year that it could mean less rainfall and a sea level rise of up to one metre in coastal areas of Europe.
""The overall picture that AMOC collapse would be catastrophic fits with my own group’s recent work showing that it would likely cause a widespread food and water security crisis,"" according to Lenton."

Ukraine's military intelligence service said on October 24 that it had detected the presence of North Korean troops deployed in Russia’s Kursk region, where the first units arrived on October 23.
Ukrainian forces staged a major incursion in August in Kursk, a Russian region bordering Ukraine, and are holding territory there.
Kyiv says this territory is being used as a buffer zone against Russian strikes on Ukraine.
According to intelligence, Zelenskiy said on X on October 25, ""the first North Korean soldiers are expected to be deployed by Russia to combat zones as early as October 27-28. He called the move ""a clear escalation by Russia.""
""The world can clearly see Russia's true intentions: to continue the war,"" he said. ""This is why a principled and strong response from global leaders is essential.""
White House national security spokesman John Kirby said it's possible that there are now more than 3,000 troops from North Korea that have been dispatched to Russia for training.
Kirby said on a call with reporters on October 25 that it was possible that some of the North Korean troops would be deployed to the Kursk region but cautioned that he did not know for what purpose.
The top national-security advisers for the United States, Japan, and South Korea had met, Kirby said, adding that they ""expressed grave concern"" about the possible deployment of North Korean troops on the battlefield against Ukraine.
The three advisers called on Russia and North Korea ""to cease these actions that only serve to expand the security implications of Russia's brutal and illegal war beyond Europe and into the Indo-Pacific,"" Kirby said.
U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said on October 23 that evidence of North Korea sending troops to Russia was the ""next step"" after Pyongyang provided Moscow with arms.
Analysts are still assessing the situation, Austin said, but Pyongyang, which has denied the accusations, could face consequences for aiding Russia directly.
Asked about whether any North Korean troops were in Russia, Russian President Vladimir Putin neither confirmed nor denied the claim.
When asked about satellite photos of troops at a news conference after a summit in Russia's Kazan, Putin said, ""images are a serious thing, if there are images, then they reflect something"
6258,real,GENDER_BASED_DISINFORMATION,2024-03-27,"Communist Chinese government-tied TikTok censored videos of women exposing the health risks of hormonal contraceptives after apparently receiving pressure from a leftist legacy media outlet.
The Washington Post released a now-infamous report attempting to discredit women speaking out about many of the well-known side effects listed on the blanket-sized warning label that comes with oral contraceptives. In its report, The Post highlighted the fact that TikTok had censored some of the people it had reached out to for the piece, including The Daily Wire commentator Brett Cooper who hosts The Comments Section and TikTok influencer Nicole Bendayan. The newspaper took credit for the part it played in the removal of multiple videos.
The Post identified one censored video as being a clip from Cooper’s May 2023 appearance on the Iced Coffee Hour podcast. In the censored video, Cooper highlighted contraception’s worrying impact on weight gain, fertility, regular hormone function and romantic attraction. The Post itself reported on the Pill users’ increased risk for cervical cancer in 1977, something it neglected to remind users of in its more recent reporting on the issue.
The clip of Cooper garnered 219,000 likes “before TikTok removed it following The Post’s inquiry,” The Post reported. Links to the TikTok video now bring up the message, “Video currently unavailable” or “This page isn’t available.” The app does not provide any further explanation.
Cooper posted on X (formerly Twitter) on March 24, “What’s ironic is that [The Post] reached out to me for a comment, and they asked WHY my video was removed and no longer available. Shocker... was because of them.” She included a screenshot of The Post’s admission about the censorship following a Post inquiry.
The Post bragged that TikTok removed five videos critical of contraception after the leftist legacy outlet demanded to know how the app “prevents the spread of misinformation.” A TikTok spokesperson claimed to the Post that the videos had “inaccurate, misleading or false content that may cause significant harm to individuals or society.” TikTok did not respond to a request for comment from MRC Free Speech America at the time of publication.
Another individual that TikTok censored was Nicole Bendayan, whose video explaining why she got off contraception went viral until censorship silenced it, according to The Post.
TikTok has a track record of anti-American bias and censorship and is currently in danger of being banned due to congressional legislation. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) owns a board seat and maintains a financial stake in TikTok’s parent company ByteDance.
Censorship occurring after leftist media outlets or researchers put pressure on Big Tech appears to be a rising trend, something addressed in a recent ""60 Minutes"" segment.
The Post’s whole piece aggressively defended contraception, bewailed the fact that some women are turning away from it, and blamed “right-wing” so-called “misinformation” for that. “Search for ‘birth control’ on TikTok or Instagram and a cascade of misleading videos vilifying hormonal contraception appear,” The Post bemoaned. “Young women blaming their weight gain on the pill. Right-wing commentators claiming that some birth control can lead to infertility. Testimonials complaining of depression and anxiety.”
Such evidence used to be mainstream. In fact, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) documents substantial evidence of serious side effects from taking hormonal “birth control”, including some of the very effects The Post scoffs at. The study published on NIH also listed serious potential long-term side effects from contraception including cancer, multiple sclerosis, weight gain and suicidal desires.
Conservatives are under attack. Contact TikTok via email at communitymanager@tiktok.com and demand Big Tech be held to account to mirror the First Amendment while providing transparency, clarity on hate speech and equal footing for conservatives.

Mexico’s newly elected president, Dr. Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, is a climate scientist who has focused heavily in her campaign on the fact that she’s a woman while downplaying her Jewish heritage.
Nicknamed “La Doctora” because of her academic credentials, which include a master’s and Ph.D. in energy engineering, Sheinbaum is the first female president in Mexico’s 200-year history after attracting around 60 percent of the vote. She hails from the same Morena party as outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and was previously the first female mayor of Mexico City.
Sheinbaum will also be the first person of Jewish heritage to run Mexico, which is largely Catholic. Both her maternal and paternal grandparents are Jewish immigrants who came to Mexico from Bulgaria and Lithuania. She has appeared to distance herself from her Jewish heritage, however, making comments like “Of course I know where I come from, but my parents were atheists,” and claiming that she “never belonged to the Jewish community.”
Although she has not spoken much about illegal immigration during her campaign, she has indicated that she will continue with the socio-economic approach of her predecessor to reducing migrant flows. This means she is unlikely to militarize border control and will probably align more with Biden than Trump when it comes to the topic of illegal immigration. She has said that she “will always tell [the U.S.] it’s better to build bridges rather than walls.”
Sheinbaum is also part of the climate cult and previously worked on the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. She is expected to push for clean energy and transportation initiatives. She researched energy use in Mexico’s transportation sector for four years at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California while she was a Ph.D. candidate in the 1990s.

California Governor Gavin Newsom shared his excitement about having an ally for his misguided climate initiatives, writing in an emailed statement: “Sharing already strong historical, cultural, environmental, and economic ties with Mexico, California looks forward to continuing its fruitful relationship with President-elect Sheinbaum.”
It is believed that she will help Mexico pursue energy independence and maintain its state-owned electricity and petroleum monopolies. However, she may deviate from her predecessor when it comes to renewable energy investments. For example, whereas Lopez Obrador embraced fossil fuels and backed state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos, Sheinbaum outlined a nearly $14 billion energy plan that will shift to renewables like solar and wind power and build the infrastructure needed to support these alternatives. She also said she is aiming to add 13.7 gigawatts of electricity to Mexico’s grid; 1 gigawatt can power roughly 750,000 homes in the U.S.
She is also seeking to modernize Mexican hydroelectric stations and add more than 2,300 miles of transmission lines. She said: “We are going to accelerate the energy transition. Going forward, we are working on this energy plan not just with an eye on 2030, but also through 2050 to align with international commitments on climate change.”
However, meeting her goals could be complicated as she will inherit Mexico’s biggest budget deficit since the 1980s. This will also make it hard to tackle some of Mexico’s other environmental challenges, such as the water crisis in Mexico City, widespread deforestation and drought.
The election was the biggest in Mexican history, with almost 100 million individuals registered to vote. It was a violent election cycle with more than 30 candidates being killed and more than 200 government officials, activists and candidates being shot overall since September as criminal organizations involved in human and drug trafficking focused on influencing local elections.

Relatives who lost contact with them alerted the guard, which then launched a search using significant resources in an attempt to locate the missing people.
Eastern Tunisia, alongside Libya, is the main departure point for thousands of irregular migrants escaping conflicts or dire economic circumstances in search of better lives in Europe.
During the first 11 months of 2023, the number of irregular migrants intercepted by Tunisian authorities reached 69,963, more than double the figure for the same period in 2022, according to statistics shared by the National Guard.
Of that figure, 77.5 percent were foreigners, mostly from sub-Saharan Africa, while the remainder were Tunisian.
The number of departures surged in Tunisia following a speech last February by President Kais Saied in which he denounced ""hordes of illegal migrants"" as a demographic threat to the country.
According to the International Organization for Migration, more than 2,270 people died attempting to cross the central Mediterranean in 2023, a 60 percent increase on the previous year.

In the UK, although there was a slight elevation in deaths in 2020, there was no excess mortality. There was no pandemic. So, what was causing the covid deaths publicised continuously on television throughout 2020?
Some were iatrogenic deaths and the rest were due to the statistical manipulation of data.
The Scottish covid Inquiry is the world’s only official covid inquiry to reveal the sheer scale of horrors inflicted by government covid lockdown policies.
Perhaps this is why Scotland’s Chief Medical Office testified on Tuesday at the UK Covid Inquiry that Scottish hospitals were inundated and the number of people in hospital “exceeded capacity on several occasions.” Perhaps it was an attempt to justify the harm that lockdowns caused.
The problem is, Public Health Scotland hospital records show the opposite of what the Chief Medical Officer testified, under oath.
Let’s not lose touch…Your Government and Big Tech are actively trying to censor the information reported by The Exposé to serve their own needs. Subscribe now to make sure you receive the latest uncensored news in your inbox…
UK Government’s Response to Covid was Inhuman
Speaking to NTD’s British Thought Leaders, Professors Martin Neil and Norman Fenton spoke about their new book which explores the science and data used to make decisions during the covid-19 pandemic.
Prof. Neil explained that although deaths were slightly elevated in the UK in 2020 there was no excess mortality. “There wasn’t really a pandemic,” he said. “The cause of those upticks and death tolls is either statistical manipulation of data or it was what we call iatrogenic effects,” he said.
Iatrogenic effects are harmful effects of medical treatment. “The way that people were treated in old people’s homes, hospitals – primarily the elderly and the vulnerable had a treatment regime imposed on them which was essentially inhuman,” he said.
When there’s a respiratory viral infection, it’s not the flu, for example, but bacterial pneumonia that might ultimately kill someone. So, during an epidemic or pandemic, there is supposed to be a stockpile of antibiotics to treat the pneumonia.
“In the UK they introduced new protocols that antibiotics were not to be given to those who were suffering from severe covid. People had ‘do not resuscitate’ orders imposed on them … The social isolation people had to suffer would have a crushing psychological effect on people’s ability to keep going, especially in an old people’s home. And so on and so forth. It’s those interventions that were causing the death ” Prof Neil said.
“A lot of this has actually come out publicly in the Scottish Covid Inquiry over the last year but hasn’t been publicised in the national press,” he said.
“Another one that needs special mention is the use of opioids to care for people with severe covid,” he said. “And ventilation … Ventilators in [ ] respiratory aid … had up to 90% fatality rate of people put on the ventilators … and alongside that were changes to the treatment regime that involved the administration of palliative care medicines in the form of opioids. Midazolam in the UK was heavily overprescribed during March [2020] … The dosage rates were so high that they don’t even conform to a palliative care regime – they were beyond that.”
Revelations at the Scottish Covid Inquiry
Biologyphenom has been following the Scottish Covid Inquiry and posting articles on Substack to document it. There is no indication whether Biologyphenom is a man or a woman, for ease, we will refer to him as a man. You can search for his articles on the Scottish Covid Inquiry HERE.
Yesterday Biologyphenom posted an article highlighting Prof. Neil’s comments to British Thought Leaders. “A superb interview on all things ‘covid’ with Professors Neil and Fenton,” he said. “I understandably have a particular focus on Prof. Neil’s comments around the Scottish Covid Inquiry … I highly recommend watching the full video and to check out the Professors’ new book ‘Fighting Goliath’,” he said.
He also noted that the Scottish Covid Inquiry is “the world’s only official covid inquiry to reveal the sheer scale of horrors inflicted by government lockdown policies.” Earlier in the month, Biologyphenom had highlighted a testimony at the Scottish Covid Inquiry last year by Amber Galbraith KC, the advocate representing Promoting A More Inclusive Society (“PAMIS”) at the hearing.
PAMIS works with children, young people and adults with profound and multiple learning disabilities (“PMLD”). Galbraith spoke of the impact of covid lockdowns on people with PMLD. “After 31 years in existence, PAMIS can state with confidence that the covid-19 pandemic represented some of the most traumatic and challenging times for people with PMLD and their families,” she said.
At the beginning of her statement, Galbraith mentioned PAMIS’ written opening statement to the Inquiry. You can find all the written opening statements for this session HERE and you can read PAMIS’ opening statement HERE.
Independent Misrepresents Statement at UK Covid Inquiry
Returning to more recent news, Biologyphenom posted an article on Thursday about remarks that Scotland’s Chief Medical Officer Professor Sir Gregor Smith made on Tuesday during the UK Covid Inquiry. He noted the highlights from Prof. Smith’s testimony:
- The elderly and vulnerable were specifically targeted as groups warranting ‘do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation’ orders (“DNACPR”) during lockdown.
- Those suffering from ‘‘severe covid’’ would not be given potentially life-saving resuscitation due to a low chance of success and no discussions needed to take place with the patient or their families.
- Prof. Smith was contacted as early as 7 April 2020, just 2 weeks into lockdown, by Scottish Care and Age Scotland over the increased use of coercion for DNACPR orders being reported by and applied to older and vulnerable people. Prof. Smith stated he does not recall the statements from these organisations.
- Emma Price, counsel to the inquiry, asked Prof. Smith: “DNACPRs should always be considered on an individual basis and there is never a justification for blanket policies, would you agree?” Prof. Smith responded: “I agree very strongly with that.”
- When asked, Prof. Smith said that no investigations were planned nor is he aware of any data on the total number of DNACRP notices used in Scotland during the “pandemic.”
Biologyphenom then goes on the fact-check several statements Prof. Smith made to the UK Covid Inquiry by comparing them to statements made at the Scottish Covid Inquiry and other sources. The Independent managed to write an entire article about the theme of one of those statements while ignoring the rest of Prof Smith’s four-and-a-half-hour testimony, including his statements indicating the misuse and/or abuse of DNACPRs.
Prof. Smith’s testimony has been uploaded onto the UK Covid Inquiry’s YouTube channel in two parts. The first part is two and a half hours and the second is two hours. You can watch the first part relating to the morning session (“AM”) HERE and the second part relating to the afternoon session (“PM”) HERE. The Independent article cherry-picked a small section of Prof Smith’s testimony from the morning session and then the author added his own twist.
“Scotland’s chief medical officer has told an inquiry how his team worked up to 16 hours a day, seven days a week, in their response to the covid pandemic,” the Independent said. The article continued:
Sir Gregor told the inquiry on Wednesday he increased the number of deputy chief medical officers from one to three during the summer of 2020 to handle the increased workload.
“The volume of work was quite incredible at that point in time,” he said.Chief medical officer and team often worked 16-hour days, Covid inquiry told, Independent, 25 September 2024
As you can see for yourself from the video below, it is not as the Independent made out. “Sir Gregor” did not tell “the inquiry on Wednesday he increased the number of deputy chief officers.” The same goes for the statement about working “16 hours a day, seven days a week.”
What actually happened was that Prof. Smith had submitted a written witness statement (dated 15 November 2023) to the Inquiry for Module 2A held in January 2024. Counsel read aloud a section from his November 2023 written statement to him at the Inquiry on Wednesday. He was asked to confirm that he had increased the number of deputy chief medical officers from one to three over the summer of 2020.
Prof. Smith responded: “Yeah, the volume of work was quite incredible at that point in time and one of the first steps that I took was to enhance that senior clinical team.”
Scotland’s Chief Medical Officer Not So Truthful Under Oath
The Independent is not the only one being creative with the facts.
Biologyphenom noted that Prof. Smith said during the afternoon session: “The number of people who were in hospital [in Scotland] was really quite immense and exceeded capacity on several occasions” (see UK Covid-19 Inquiry, Module 3 Hearing, 25 September 2024 PM timestamp 58:49).
However, as Biologyphenom pointed out, “[The] official data shows quite the opposite” and shared the graph below from Public Health Scotland.
Did the Scottish Chief Medical Officer just lie having sworn to tell “the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth”?

If Your Time is short
All blood collectors are required to ask donors about their vaccine history because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires various wait times to donate blood for live-attenuated vaccines — vaccines that use a weakened form of the virus that causes infection.
The FDA has not approved any live-attenuated COVID-19 vaccines for use in the U.S., FDA spokesperson Carly Pflaum said, although one is being developed and is in clinical trials.
If a potential donor who was vaccinated doesn’t know the manufacturer of the COVID-19 vaccine they received, the American Red Cross asks them to wait two weeks before donating blood to prevent the risk of spreading the virus from a live-attenuated vaccine.
Learn more about PolitiFact’s fact-checking process and rating system.
An American Red Cross questionnaire asking blood donors about their vaccination status does not show that COVID-19 vaccines are unsafe, as some social media users have claimed.
Multiple Instagram posts shared screenshots from an American Red Cross blood donor survey that asked, ""Have you EVER had a Coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine?""
The posts includes text without proper punctuation that says, ""The American Red Cross is now asking blood donors if they ever received the Covid vaccine If you answer Yes, they want you to call ahead to see if you’re still eligible I thought the vax was ‘safe and effective’? What info are they hiding from us?""
These posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.)
First, the question is not new. American Red Cross spokesperson Daniel Parra told PolitiFact in an email that the organization has been asking potential donors if they’ve been vaccinated against COVID-19 since December 2020.
All blood collectors ask every potential donor about their vaccine history, Parra said, because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires various wait times to donate blood depending on the vaccine donors received.
For example, people who received a measles, mumps and rubella vaccine are asked to wait four weeks before donating blood, and those who received a hepatitis B vaccine are asked to wait 21 days before giving blood, according to American Red Cross guidance.
Parra said people who received a COVID-19 vaccine are asked to provide the name of the vaccine’s manufacturer to ensure they received an FDA-approved vaccine. If their vaccine was approved by the FDA, then they can give blood without a waiting period. If they can’t remember the name of the manufacturer, they must wait two weeks from their vaccination before they can give blood.
FDA guidance was updated in 2022 to say that COVID-19 vaccine recipients do not need a waiting period for blood donation unless they received a live-attenuated viral COVID-19 vaccine, in which case they should wait two weeks.
Live-attenuated vaccines are distinct because they contain a weakened form of the germ that can cause an infection. They are included in some bacterial and viral vaccines to provide immunity against future infection. The Association for the Advancement of Blood & Biotherapies, a non-profit representing blood collectors and other institutions involved in transfusion medicine, says wait periods are recommended because it is possible that blood donors who have received live-attenuated vaccines can pass the virus to others through blood donations.
Carly Pflaum, an FDA spokesperson, told PolitiFact via email that no live-attenuated viral COVID-19 vaccines are authorized for use in the U.S., and all FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines are nonreplicating, inactivated or mRNA based.
However, a live-attenuated COVID-19 vaccine is under development in the clinical trial stage. This vaccine would be administered intranasally and produce an immune response to multiple COVID-19 strains and variants.
There is no scientific evidence showing U.S.-approved COVID-19 vaccines contaminate blood transfusions and put recipients at risk. ""The COVID-19 vaccine is designed to generate an immune response to help protect an individual from illness, but vaccine components themselves are not found within the bloodstream,"" Parra said.
We rate the claim that an American Red Cross questionnaire asking blood donors about their vaccination status proves COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous False.

3551,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-06-03,"Step aside BMI, body composition tests are on the rise. Here's what to know
Body composition tests are more useful than BMI
The scale has never been a friend to Mana Mostatabi. Even back in high school, when she ran a quick 100m on the varsity track team, her BMI – a ratio of weight to height – put her in the overweight category.
“My dad always joked that I should be a wrestler,” Mostatabi says due to her build. Many professional athletes flunk BMI tests. Some are considered obese despite their fitness, and many doctors say it isn’t a helpful metric to focus on.
“BMI is a very crude measure,” says Dr. Richard Joseph, a physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital who specializes in metabolic health. “It doesn’t tell me much about your underlying health,” he says. People can be a normal weight but have low muscle mass and high body fat, while others have higher body weight but are muscular and lean.
That’s why Mostatabi has found a new tool – a body composition scan – that measures her body fat and muscle mass, which are two key metrics of health. “It’s very affirming,” Mostatabi says. Over the last year, she has lost ten pounds of body fat and also gained several pounds of muscle. “This actually gives me information,” to track progress. “It really is motivating,” she says.
Body composition scans are becoming an increasingly popular way to gauge health and there are lots of different kinds.
An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is considered the gold standard, but it’s not practical for most people given the expense and access to medical imaging.
Dr. Joseph orders DEXA – dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry – scans for some of his patients. These scans measure bone mineral density, and also measure body composition and fat distribution. They typically cost more than $100, but prices have begun to drop in some areas as demand rises and more machines are available.
An option that’s taken off in gyms and workout studios, such as Anytime Fitness and Orangetheory Fitness is bioelectric impedance analysis, using devices such as the InBody or the Evolt 360. Depending on the studio, the scans are often free with membership or are available for a small fee. This test is not as precise as an MRI or DEXA, but is reliable at tracking changes over time, as long as people follow directions.
Mostatabi had her first InBody scan in January, when she signed up for a strength challenge at Orangetheory. “It’s a super simple process,” Mostatabi says, which takes less than a minute.
The device looks like a scale with two arms. “You step onto the machine,” which has a metal base, she explains and you hold onto the ends of the two arms which send a safe, low-level electrical current through the body, estimating fat and lean mass.
“How fast that current is returning to the electrodes gives a measurement of how much fat mass and muscle you have, because the current travels through those body tissues at different speeds,” explains Scott Brown, Vice President of fitness at Orangetheory. The technology is decades old, and has become increasingly popular with the advent of commercial devices and rising demand.
Mostatabi says you can’t feel anything during the test, and the results are sent directly to a smart phone app. Her first scan gave her a benchmark to improve upon.
She explains her fitness took a nosedive during the pandemic, and she was aiming for a fresh start this year. All winter she pushed herself through 60 minute classes that combined resistance training, weight lifting, cardio on a treadmill and rowing. “I was very diligent,” averaging about five to six classes per week.
“The InBody scan is the first tool I’ve ever used that shows gains,” she says. Mostatabi was accustomed to weighing herself, and recalls the frustration when the scale would not budge. Now, even if she hasn’t lost weight, she knows her body is healthier, with a lower percentage of body fat and an increase in muscle.
“It’s just incredibly empowering,” she says, knowing that women who weight train and build strength can expect to live longer and healthier lives.
On average, women gain less muscle at a slower rate compared to men. During Orangetheory’s eight week ‘transformation challenge’ the company found that males who were focused on muscle gains added about .83 lbs of muscle over eight weeks, on average, compared to a half pound of muscle gain for females. Though across all participants there was only about .1 lb of average muscle gain.
Eight weeks is not a lot of time to gain muscle, explains Brown. And he says it’s important to set “realistic goals and targets'' given the variability from person to person. The ability to build new muscle is influenced by gender, age and genetics.
Dr. Joseph says the reason it can be helpful to know your muscle mass is because studies show that strength is a predictor of longevity. Also, loss of muscle increases the risk of falling, which is a top cause of death from injury among older people. “A lot of people are under-muscled,” Joseph says.
When it comes to body fat, having too much can increase the risk of metabolic disease, especially visceral fat, which surrounds the abdominal organs including the stomach, liver and intestines. “It’s inflammatory,” Joseph says and drives up the risk of heart disease. The American College of Sport Medicine sets fitness categories for body fat based on age and gender, but there isn’t not an agreed upon target for what’s considered ideal. Using the ACSM standards, most Americans could be classified in the “poor fitness” category, as the average body fat among adults in the U.S. is 33%. The U.S. military considers the optimal body fat for military fitness to be between 10% and 20% for young men and up to 25% for middle-aged men. Women typically have more body fat, with an ideal range from 15% to 30% for young women and up to 38% for middle-aged women.
Joseph says the rule of thumb for fitness is that “it’s you versus you.” Rather than fixate on an external benchmark, “it’s most important to look at trends over time,” in your body composition, he says.
It’s possible to lose fat and gain muscle, without losing any weight. This is what happened to Karen White, who is 59, and a certified health coach in Alexandria, Virginia. She’s gained about three pounds of muscle over the last three years, and has shed body fat,too. Her body fat has dropped from 26% down to 22%. “Literally, I’m the exact same weight,” after three years of tracking, but the positive changes in her body composition are profound.
She lifts weights three times a week, for about 30 minutes and has progressively built up to lifting heavier weights. She still does cardio work-outs and stays active with daily walks with her dog, though she has shifted her focus to resistance training.
“The misperception is that older people can't gain muscle, and that's absolutely not true,” she says. She points to a new client she’s working with in her 60s. Already, after a few months, her client has lost body fat and increased her strength.
White agrees that it’s important to set realistic expectations, and recognize the changes in body composition may take time. She has gained about a pound of muscle per year, on average, and feels a lot stronger.
Given that muscle peaks in our 30s, it’s important to do strength-training to maintain muscle mass, especially as we age. “The risk of frailty really increases exponentially with age,” Dr. Joseph says and muscle-loss, also called sarcopenia, affects an estimated 45% of older adults, especially women. Weight training can help fend off this loss.

3037,fake,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-04-04,"(LifeSiteNews) — Various governments have made commitments to expand the use of electric vehicles (EVs) and alternative energy systems. The stated objectives include reducing pollution, improving human health and the environment, protecting the environment and providing reliable energy at lower costs. Among those jumping on this band wagon are the governments of the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the European Union, and the Governorate of Vatican City State.
Here’s the big question: Will adopting these technologies achieve these goals? To get an answer, we will examine what they require for operation, decommissioning and supporting infrastructure.
For starters, EV batteries require lithium, whose mining needs 2 metric tons of water for every 1 kilogram (kg) of extracted metal. To put things into perspective, each Tesla battery requires about 10 kg of lithium, which means that 20 metric tons of water are needed for each battery. To make matters worse, lithium is usually found in deserts that lack readily available water in large quantities.
EV batteries also require cobalt, with the Democratic Republic of the Congo being the largest producer and exporter of cobalt. Unfortunately, the expansion of cobalt mines has turned green areas into barren lands and often employs child labor in the extraction. For instance, Kasulo, located in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and formerly a popular urban neighborhood, has been made unlivable since underground ores began to be exploited in 2014.
As if these weren’t enough, EVs and wind and solar energy systems require rare earth metals. The mining of these results in environmental destruction, including deforestation, soil erosion, water contamination, loss of wildlife habitats, changes in landscapes, air pollution and adverse health effects to miners, including lead poisoning.
Thus, instead of reducing pollution and protecting the environment, switching to EVs and alternative energy systems does the opposite, beginning with the mining of necessary materials.
The construction of the infrastructure needed for alternative energy systems (e.g., hydro, solar, wind and geothermal) requires more than four times the amount of materials (e.g., steel, glass, copper, cement/concrete, aluminum, iron, lead, plastic and silicon) than conventional energy systems (coal, natural gas and nuclear). Compared to coal-fired power plants, land requirements for solar and wind energy systems are about 33 and 179 times more, respectively. These high material and land costs increase the cost of energy.
During their operation, solar energy systems and wind turbines kill birds, with the latter being fatal to bats as well, and have proved to be unreliable.
Reliability issues induced by over-reliance on wind and solar have arisen in numerous locales around the globe. For instance, California has been converting to solar, decommissioning all but one of its coal-fired power plants and all but one of its nuclear power plants and minimizing its use of gas-fired power. As a result, the state experienced rolling blackouts during a heat wave in the summer of 2020.
Similarly, Texas invested heavily in wind and solar only to have both fail miserably during a winter storm in February 2021. Frozen wind turbines and snow-covered solar panels left much of Texas without electric power for long periods, which led to the deaths of more than 200 people and billions of dollars in economic losses. The following July, natural gas power plants were called upon to make up for failing wind and solar energy systems during a heat wave.
During the winter of 2020-21, Germany had an experience similar to that of Texas when wind and solar succumbed to the effects of cold and snow. Since the country began switching to wind and solar around 2000, the price of German electricity has more than tripled.
In short, wind and solar energy systems are not cheap, reliable or environmentally friendly.
EVs also prove to be dangerous, unreliable and expensive. Because their lithium-ion batteries store so much chemical and electrical energies, EVs have become known as fire hazards. Compared to internal combustion engines, the power systems of EVs produce fires that are harder to extinguish because the batteries could reignite and cooling the battery pack is difficult. To make matters worse, EV fires may release large amounts of poisonous gases, such as hydrogen fluoride.

Cold weather is a nemesis of EVs, as it is for many battery-operated devices. Temperatures below 32 °F (0 °C) can cause the driving range of EVs to drop significantly or even render the vehicle useless due to the increase in the internal resistance of lithium-ion batteries at cold temperatures. Charging EVs in cold weather can significantly increase the time needed for recharging and may cause permanent battery damage.
While it’s true that EVs do not have exhaust emissions, one needs to consider that there are other types of emissions, including particulate matter (PM) from brake wear, tire wear, road wear and resuspension of road dust. Because EVs are 24 percent heavier (due to their batteries) compared to their equivalent internal combustion engine vehicles, EVs emit about the same amounts of PM10 and emit only about 1-3 percent less PM2.5 than internal combustion engine vehicles. In fact, there is a positive relationship between the vehicle weight and its particulate matter emissions.
Finally, the disposing of EV batteries and the decommissioning of wind turbines and solar panels are both problematic environmental issues.
EV batteries last about 5 to 10 years and need to be replaced when their output goes below 80% of their initial capacities. Storing, burying, and exporting these used lithium-ion batteries are no longer acceptable. Unfortunately, the direct recycling of these batteries, with high remaining capacities, would be prohibitively expensive and highly energy- and resource-intensive, and would pollute the air, water and land.

Similarly, the blades of wind turbines last about 10 years. The life of wind-turbine towers and solar panels is about 25 years. Only a few landfills in the United States are large enough to handle the wind turbine blades. Solar panels are not particularly welcome in landfills, because they contain toxic materials, such as lead and cadmium, that can leach into soil. Dr. Wallace Manheimer noted that despite these dangers, solar panels have been put in landfills because “the cost of the recycled materials is considerably more than the cost of the raw materials.”
EVs and wind and solar energy are not environmentally friendly nor provide reliable and affordable energy and transportation. They should be discontinued for the well-being of humanity and the environment.

Story Highlights
- Nearly four in 10 LGBT Americans have seriously considered fostering
- Discrimination is a major barrier for potential LGBT foster parents
- LGBT men more likely than women to worry about discrimination
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Americans who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender are significantly more likely than non-LGBT adults to express an interest in fostering children and to consider adopting from the foster care system. Thirty-seven percent of LGBT adults have seriously considered fostering a child, and 32% have seriously considered adoption, compared with 23% and 15% of non-LGBT adults, respectively.
Younger Americans are more likely than older adults to be interested in fostering or adopting -- those younger than 40 are seven percentage points more likely to be interested in fostering and 14 points more likely to consider adopting than those 40 and older -- and younger people are more likely to identify as LGBT. That said, the data show that interest in fostering is higher among LGBT than non-LGBT adults, regardless of age.
These findings come from the Americans’ Views of U.S. Foster Care study conducted by Gallup and Kidsave in March and April 2023. This study is part of Kidsave’s EMBRACE Project -- which stands for Expanding Meaningful Black Relationships and Creating Equity -- aimed at improving the outcomes for Black foster youth.
More than a third of LGBT adults say that discrimination they may face due to sexual orientation or gender identity is a major barrier to getting involved in foster care. In fact, those who are LGBT are more than three times as likely as non-LGBT individuals to say possible discrimination is a major barrier.
The same is true for adopting from foster care. More than a third (36%) of LGBT Americans say possible gender or sexual identity discrimination is a major barrier to adopting, compared with only 10% of adults who are not LGBT.
The study finds that fear of discrimination is a barrier across many identities and backgrounds. One in four Black Americans (25%) and 21% of Hispanic adults say racial and ethnic discrimination is a major barrier to providing foster care, compared with 13% of White Americans.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Children and Families, there were nearly 400,000 children in the U.S. foster care system as of 2021. With over 100,000 of those children in need of permanent families, it’s crucial to understand what is preventing interested Americans from participating in fostering or adoption programs.
LGBT Men More Concerned About Discrimination in Fostering and Adoption
More than four in 10 LGBT women (44%) have thought a lot about fostering or taken steps to get started, compared with 29% of LGBT men. Among the LGBT population, women (37%) are also slightly more likely than men (26%) to have considered adopting.
The data suggest that anticipated discrimination could be disproportionately hurting interest in fostering and adoption among LGBT men. Nearly half of LGBT men say discrimination based on gender or sexual identity is a major barrier to getting involved with foster care or adopting from foster care, while 22% of LGBT women have significant concerns about discrimination.
Inequalities in Access
Perceptions of discrimination persist when one evaluates fairness in the foster care system overall. Four in 10 (41%) LGBT Americans disagree or strongly disagree that adoption from foster care is equally accessible, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation. Only 21% of adults who are not LGBT say the same.
Bottom Line
As of 2022, Gallup finds that 7.2% of the U.S. adult population identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. That’s an estimated 18.7 million Americans. Those who identify as LGBT are much more likely than the average American to have seriously considered fostering or adopting. Yet a significant portion are hesitant to get involved due to the belief that their gender or sexual identity will be a barrier. This is especially true for LGBT men.
Fear of facing discrimination is holding back potentially millions of LGBT families and individuals who are serious about caring for children in need of a home. Family service organizations raising awareness about perceptions of discrimination and addressing those concerns could potentially boost the number of LGBT people open to taking the first step toward fostering children or adopting from the foster care system.

Survey Methods
Quantitative data for this study were collected using both mail and web surveys in March through April 2023. A total of 5,469 surveys were collected. Of those, 3,967 responses were collected using the Gallup Panel, a probability-based panel that selects respondents using random-digit-dial phone interviews that cover both mobile and landline phones (as well as some address-based sampling recruitment). In order to obtain sufficient responses from Black Americans and others, an additional 1,502 responses were collected through a third-party opt-in sample provider. All web responses were collected using the same platform.
The Gallup Panel and opt-in samples were weighted independently and then combined using composite weighting procedures. Base weights for the Panel data were generated to correct for unequal selection probabilities. Post-stratification weights were then used to match national demographics of gender, age, race, Hispanic ethnicity and education, with cross-classified targets within race. Demographic weighting targets were based on the most recent Current Population Survey estimates for the aged 18+ population.
The adjusted margin of error (adjusted for design effect) for the 5,469 overall respondents is ±1.9 percentage points, and the design effect is 2.0. All adjusted margins of error are reported at the confidence level of 95%.

Demystifying U.S. foster care -- especially eligibility requirements and the experience of mentoring or parenting a foster child -- could boost mentorship and foster/adoptive parenting.
Black adults are more likely than adults of other racial backgrounds to consider providing foster care, but they have less trust in the foster care system overall.
Gallup recently tested several methods for capturing and measuring transgender identities.
Trends measuring Americans' values need to be analyzed in the context of differences in question wording and changes in methodology.

3829,fake,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-09-13,"As one of the body's detoxification organs, your kidneys play a major role in processing toxic molecules and chemicals that enter your body, including medications. As such, they are just as susceptible as the liver – the body's main detoxification organ – to damage (nephrotoxicity) caused by drug toxicity.
The detoxification process is a series of events that starts in the liver. The liver first breaks down substances present in your blood into their chemical components. While the beneficial ones are returned to circulation to be distributed throughout your body, the harmful molecules/toxins are further broken down by the liver, making them ready for the next stage of processing which happens in the kidneys. (Related: Help your liver detoxify: 4 Tips to remove toxins from the body.)
The kidneys work like a sieve, removing waste, other unwanted substances and excess fluid from your blood so they can be flushed out of your body via your urine. Because your kidneys need water to clear out all the harmful chemicals from your bloodstream, sufficient water intake is vital to the success of your body's detoxification process. Your kidneys normally filter your entire blood supply between 20 and 25 times each day.
Although not discussed as often as it should be, many commonly used medications do in fact harm the kidneys even when taken in small doses or only occasionally. In fact, research suggests that about 20 percent of community- and hospital-acquired cases of acute kidney failure are caused by medications.
There are many ways harmful prescriptions can cause kidney injury and impair kidney function. According to research, drug-induced nephrotoxicity occurs through the following mechanisms:
Despite their intended use, modern pharmaceuticals have the potential to cause more health problems, especially with prolonged or incorrect use. In fact, many commonly prescribed medications are notorious for causing side effects that reduce quality of life for their users.
While prescription drugs may help resolve certain issues, this does not change the fact that they are still made of synthetic chemicals that can cause toxicity to healthy cells and organs. Besides the liver, your kidneys are among the most susceptible to the toxic effects of certain medications.
Here are seven categories of medications that are known to harm the kidneys: (h/t to TheEpochTimes.com)
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and naproxen are said to help reduce pain, fever and inflammation by blocking the production of prostaglandins. While the analgesic acetaminophen is thought to work in a similar way, it does not treat inflammation.
According to studies, NSAIDs cause kidney injury via altered intraglomerular hemodynamics and glomerulonephritis. Acetaminophen and aspirin are linked to chronic interstitial nephritis, which impairs your kidneys' ability to filter blood and make urine.
Excessive use of diuretics, which help bring down blood pressure and get rid of extra fluid at the same time, can decrease blood flow to your kidneys, resulting in kidney damage. Meanwhile, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, which are used to manage hypertension, have been associated with altered intraglomerular hemodynamics.
The antiplatelet (anti-blood clot) medications, clopidogrel and ticlopidine, have been found to cause TMA, while statins, which are used to lower blood cholesterol levels, are reported to cause rhabdomyolysis. (Related: Statins are the most prescribed drug with over-hyped benefits and downplayed side effects.)
Excessive use of antibiotics is linked to the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Certain antibiotics are also known to cause kidney damage. For example, aminoglycosides, which are known as broad-spectrum antibiotics, are associated with tubular cell toxicity.
Meanwhile, beta-lactams, which include penicillin derivatives and cephalosporins, have been found to cause acute interstitial nephritis and glomerulonephritis. Quinolones, a type of antibiotics that directly kill bacterial cells, have been reported to cause acute interstitial nephritis and crystal nephropathy.
Amphotericin B, which is used to treat serious fungal infections, and pentamidine, an antifungal agent commonly used by HIV patients to prevent a serious type of pneumonia, are also linked to tubular cell toxicity.
Many antiviral medications are known to cause mitochondrial injury in kidney epithelial cells. Acyclovir, which is used to treat chickenpox, shingles and herpes simplex infections, has been shown to cause acute interstitial nephritis and crystal nephropathy.
Foscarnet, an FDA-approved antiviral for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, and ganciclovir, which is used to treat CMV infections of the eyes, have been found to cause crystal nephropathy and tubular cell toxicity.
Antiretroviral medications, which are used for the management of HIV/AIDS, are also linked to tubular cell toxicity, acute interstitial nephritis, crystal nephropathy and rhabdomyolysis.
Antidepressants are among the most frequently prescribed medications in the United States. Unfortunately, they are also some of the most harmful prescription drugs to the body, particularly the kidneys. (Related: STUDY: These prescription medications can increase your risk of depression.)
Studies show that tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline and doxepin, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like fluoxetine can cause rhabdomyolysis. Meanwhile, lithium, a mood stabilizer used for the treatment of depression associated with bipolar disorder, has been found to cause chronic interstitial nephritis, glomerulonephritis and rhabdomyolysis.
Drugs used in chemotherapy can harm more than just your kidneys because they do not selectively target cancer cells. These toxic chemicals also kill healthy fast-growing cells, such as those in your skin and digestive tract.
Chemotherapeutic drugs like carmustine, which is used to treat brain tumors, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma, and cisplatin, which contains platinum, have been linked to chronic interstitial nephritis and tubular cell toxicity.
Interferon-alfa, an immunomodulator, is said to cause glomerulonephritis. Methotrexate, an antimetabolite and immunosuppressant, can cause crystal nephropathy. Meanwhile, the antitumor drug mitomycin-C has been shown to cause thrombotic microangiopathy.
Contrast agents are dyes used by radiologists to enhance the radiodensity of tissues. These chemicals work by ""altering the way that electromagnetic radiation or ultrasound waves pass through the body.""
Contrast agents are known for their toxicity, which could lead to renal insufficiency (poor kidney function) or acute kidney failure. The use of contrast agents in clinical settings has been linked to tubular cell toxicity.
The kidneys are important organs that help keep your body healthy by facilitating the removal of toxic substances from your blood. But because of this crucial role, your kidneys are susceptible to drug-induced toxicity.
To keep your kidneys and other detoxification organs healthy, opt for natural medicines instead of synthetic drugs and formulations. Learn more about natural alternatives to prescription medications at AlternativeMedicine.news.

2426,real,INSTITUTIONAL_AND_MEDIA_DISTRUST_PUBLIC_INSTITUTIONS,2024-06-09,"While the centre, liberal and green parties are set to retain the balance of power in the 720-seat parliament, the vote dealt a domestic blow to the leaders of both France and Germany, raising questions about how the European Union’s major powers can drive policy in the bloc.
Making a risky gamble in a bid to seek to re-establish his authority, Macron called a parliamentary election, with the first round on June 30.
Read moreFrance’s Macron calls snap election in huge gamble after EU polls debacle
Like Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also endured a painful night where his Social Democrats scored their worst result ever, suffering at the hands of the mainstream conservatives and hard right Alternative for Germany (AfD).
Meanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni saw her position strengthened by her arch-conservative Brothers of Italy group winning the most votes, exit polls showed.
A rightwards shift inside the European Parliament may make it tougher to pass new legislation that might be needed to respond to security challenges, the impact of climate change or industrial competition from China and the United States.
However, exactly how much clout the euro-sceptic nationalist parties will wield will depend on their ability to overcome their differences and work together. They are currently split between two different families, and some parties and lawmakers for now lie outside these groupings.
‘Anchor of stability’
The centre-right European People's Party (EPP) will be the biggest political family in the new legislature, gaining five seats to field 189 deputies, a centralised exit poll showed.
In Poland, Prime Minister Donald Tusk's centrist Civic Coalition, a member of the EPP, was set to win the European vote. In Spain as well, the centre-right People's Party, also part of the EPP, came out on top, outperforming Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.
Such results were good news for EPP member Ursula von der Leyen who seeks a second five-year term at the helm of the powerful EU executive arm.
And she was quick to present herself as a shield against extremes.
""No majority can be formed without the EPP and together ... We will build a bastion against the extremes from the left and from the right,"" she told supporters at the EPP's election night event in Brussels.
She added, later in the evening: ""But it is also true that extremes and on the left and the right have gained support and this is why the result comes with great responsibility for the parties in the centre.""
Von der Leyen may still need support from some right-wing nationalists, such as Meloni's Brothers of Italy to secure a parliamentary majority, giving Meloni and her European Conservative and Reformists (ECR) allies more leverage - which could upset other potential allies.
Blow to the Greens
The centre-left Socialists and Democrats are poised to be the second biggest political family, even as they lost four lawmakers to end up with 135, the exit poll showed.
Political observers attribute the shift to the right to the rise in the cost of living, concerns about migration and the cost of the green transition as well as the war in Ukraine – worries that nationalist and populist parties have seized on.
""I think a lot of people felt that Europe is doing things not with people, but just doing it on top of people,"" Greens' lead candidate Bas Eickhout told Reuters in an interview, asked why the far right was doing so well.
""And I think here we need to come up with a credible answer, otherwise, we're only getting further to the far right,"" he said, after the Greens and liberals lost ground in the election.
The exit poll projected that pro-European centre-right, centre-left, liberal and Green parties will retain a majority of 460 seats, but one which is slimmed down compared to their 488 in the outgoing chamber of 705 deputies.
Europe's Green parties in particular suffered heavy losses, subsiding to 53 deputies from 71 in the outgoing parliament.
The number of non-affiliated deputies who may choose to join other groups, including the euro-sceptics, jumped by 33 to 95, the exit poll said.
The European Parliament co-decides with the intergovernmental European Council on laws governing the 27-nation bloc of 450 million people.

3666,fake,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-10-16,"(LifeSiteNews) — Fifty-nine percent of registered voters would support banning the surgical or chemical “transitioning” of minors at the federal level, according to a new national poll conducted by Noble Predictive Insights.
The New York Post reported that the poll, commissioned by The Center Square, found that such a ban would also have the support of 36 percent of Democrats and 56 percent of independents. Younger voters (age 18-34) were the age group with the lowest level of support for a ban, but it still reached a majority at 52 percent.
“(O)n many issues surrounding trans rights and students or youth, the GOP has public opinion on their side,” Noble Predictive Insights’ David Byler said. “There’s a reason that, when you look at GOP ads, they are constantly hammering this and other related issues. And some prominent Democrats are pushing out moderate, rather than left, messages.”
“Republicans know that trans issues are a strong social issue for them – and after getting hit hard on abortion so many times since Dobbs, they want to make sure they’re pushing back and finding social issues that work for them,” Byler continued.
A significant body of evidence shows that “affirming” gender confusion carries serious harms, especially when done with impressionable children who lack the mental development, emotional maturity, and life experience to consider the long-term ramifications of the decisions being pushed on them, or full knowledge about the long-term effects of life-altering, physically transformative, and often-irreversible surgical and chemical procedures.
Studies find that more than 80 percent of children experiencing gender dysphoria outgrow it on their own by late adolescence, and that even full “reassignment” surgery often fails to resolve gender-confused individuals’ heightened tendency to engage in self-harm and suicide – and may even exacerbate it, including by reinforcing their confusion and neglecting the actual root causes of their mental strife.
Many oft-ignored “detransitioners,” individuals who attempted to live under a different “gender identity” before embracing their sex, attest to the physical and mental harm of reinforcing gender confusion, as well as to the bias and negligence of the medical establishment on the subject, many of whom take an activist approach to their profession and begin cases with a predetermined conclusion that “transitioning” is the best solution.
“Gender-affirming” physicians have also been caught on video admitting to more old-fashioned motives for such procedures, as with a 2022 exposé about Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s Clinic for Transgender Health, where Dr. Shayne Sebold Taylor said outright that “these surgeries make a lot of money.”
The Democrat presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, is campaigning on continuing the Biden administration’s radical pro-LGBT policies, specifically endorsing the so-called “Equality Act” that would grant “transgender” males access to women’s private spaces, such as bathrooms, changing rooms, and shelters, require employers and schools to use “preferred pronouns,” allow gender-confused males to compete in female sports, and force health care professionals to facilitate “sex changes,” including for children, conservatives have warned.
Her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, has pledged to “make it a felony for any medical professional to perform surgery on a minor without parental consent,” along with opposing taxpayer funding for the procedures, though after repeating the promise this week has yet to clarify if he meant that underage transitions would be allowed as long as parents approve, or if he was merely attempting to emphasize Democrats’ support for leaving parents in the dark."
5663,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-11-09,"EU foreign policy chief Josef Borrell assured Ukraine that the war-torn country had Europe’s ""unwavering"" support, while Kyiv announced during the EU official’s surprise visit that it was organizing a meeting with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.
It was the first visit by a top EU official to Ukraine since Trump's November 5 victory, which has led to uncertainty in Kyiv about the West's continued commitment to supporting Ukraine as it tries to fend off invading Russian forces.
Borrell's surprise visit also came as Russia continues to heavily target Ukraine with drone and missile strikes and as Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow was open to hearing Trump's proposals on ending the war Russia launched nearly 1,000 days ago. Trump has claimed he could end the war even before he takes office on January 20.
""The clear purpose of this visit is to express European Union support to Ukraine. This support remains unwavering,"" Borrell told journalists in Kyiv. ""This support is absolutely needed for you to continue defending yourself against Russia aggression.""
Earlier Borrell, who is set to leave office next month, wrote on X that ""the EU's support for Ukraine has been my personal priority throughout my mandate and will remain at the top of the EU's agenda.""
Those comments came hours after another deadly attack on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, this time an apartment building in the Black Sea port city of Odesa. Meanwhile, Ukraine claimed it had struck with drones a Russian munitions plant in Tula.
Trump's election victory has raised concerns in Kyiv, which depends heavily on U.S. and EU support in the face of Russia’s ongoing invasion.
Trump has suggested Kyiv should agree to cede some territory to Moscow in return for peace, a condition Ukrainian President Zelenskiy has rejected.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha told reporters on November 9 that Ukraine is ready to work with the Trump administration.
""Remember that President Zelenskiy was one of the first world leaders...to greet President Trump,"" he said, referring to Zelenskiy's phone call with Trump on November 6 . ""It was a sincere conversation, an exchange of thoughts regarding further cooperation.""
Sybiha confirmed alongside Borrell that the Ukrainian government was organizing a meeting between Zelenskiy and Trump. The two last met in September when the Ukrainian president traveled to the United States to present his ""victory plan"" against Russia.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Ryabkov said in an interview with the Russian state news agency Interfax prior to Borrell's arrival in Kyiv that Moscow and Washington were ""exchanging signals"" on Ukraine through ""closed channels.""
He did not say whether the exchanges were with outgoing President Joe Biden's administration or with Trump or members of his incoming administration.
Ryabkov said Moscow was prepared to listen to Trump's proposals regarding ending the war against Ukraine as long as they were ""ideas on how to move forward in the area of settlement, and not in the area of further pumping the Kyiv regime with all kinds of aid.""
A report by the British daily the Telegraph this week suggested that Trump could propose freezing the current front line, which runs through significant swaths of territory in eastern Ukraine, setting up a buffer zone between Russian and Ukrainian forces.
In exchange, the newspaper reported based on sources close to Trump, Ukraine would agree not to join NATO for 20 years and Washington would provide Kyiv with a large amount of weapons to deter Russia from resuming the war.
On November 9, a long-time Republican strategist who worked on Trump’s campaign told the BBC that the incoming administration would be asking Zelenskiy for a “realistic vision for peace.”
According to the strategist, Bryan Lanza, that vision would not include restoring territory occupied by Russia in eastern Ukraine, nor Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, which Russia invaded and illegally annexed in 2014.
“If President Zelenskiy comes to the table and says, well we can only have peace if we have Crimea, he shows to us that he's not serious. Crimea is gone,"" Lanza said.
A spokesperson from the incoming Trump administration later said that Lanza did not speak for Trump and that the president-elect’s transition team is still drafting policies that Trump might adopt in his second term in office.
""Nobody knows exactly what the new administration is going to do,"" Borrell told an AFP journalist accompanying him on his trip to Kyiv, noting that Biden still has two months left in office. ""But we Europeans have to use this opportunity in order to build a stronger and united Europe, and one of the manifestations of being united and being stronger and able to act is our role in supporting Ukraine.""
Borrell said it was up to EU countries to decide ""when and how to increase"" their support if needed. However, he added that at a meeting of EU leaders in Budapest on November 8 ""most of the member states were insisting on the same line, [to] continue supporting Ukraine.""
Ukrainian troops are fatigued and stretched as Russian invading forces make gradual gains in the east. Meanwhile, Russian drone and missile attacks on civilian infrastructure continue.
Russian drones struck an apartment building in Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odesa late on November 8, triggering a large fire.
The public broadcaster Suspilne and other media outlets posted video on social media showing cars and buildings ablaze and thick smoke billowing skyward.
One person was killed and 13 injured, including children, in the attack, the Odesa Regional Prosecutor's Office said on November 9.
A further 32 Russian drones were shot down over 10 Ukrainian regions, while 18 were ""lost,"" according to Ukraine's air force, likely having been electronically jammed.
Experts say systematic or widespread bombardment of housing, civilian objects, and infrastructure are strictly prohibited by international humanitarian law, criminal law, and human rights law. Russia regularly denies targeting Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure.
Meanwhile, a source in Ukraine's SBU Security Service told RFE/RL’s Ukrainian Service on November 9 that drones had struck the Aleksinsky chemical plant in the Tula region about 200 kilometers south of Moscow.
The plant produces gunpowder, ammunition, and weapons. The targeting of the plant was part of a strategy to target factories that support Moscow's war against Ukraine, the source said.
Russia’s Defense Ministry said earlier that 50 Ukrainian drones were destroyed over Russian regions overnight. The governor of the Tula region said a house there had been damaged by drone debris. He made no mention of the reported strike on the plant."
6102,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-10-09,"Climate experts warn that much of the fabric of life on Earth is at risk and urge immediate action.
Several of the Earth’s ‘vital signs’ have hit record extremes, showing that climate breakdown is imminent, a group of senior climate scientists says.
Out of 35 identified planetary health markers, including air and ocean surface temperature and sea ice extent, 25 are now at their worst level ever recorded.
With the threat of ecological overshoot looming, climate experts fear a possible societal collapse.
‘Climate change could eventually contribute to societal collapse’
They warn that hundreds of millions or even billions of people will be displaced if business as usual continues, leading to greater geopolitical instability and conflicts.
Climate change could cause many millions of additional deaths worldwide by 2050, they add, stressing that since last year, heatwaves have already killed more than a thousand people just in Asia.
“The future of humanity hangs in the balance,” experts stress, in a state of the climate report published yesterday in the journal BioScience.
“Climate change could contribute to a collapse by increasing the likelihood of catastrophic risks such as international conflict or by causing multiple stresses, resulting in system-wide synchronous failures.”
Multiple climate change indicators have hit record-highs
In 2024, several indicators have hit record highs, including the number of human and animal livestock populations, per capita meat production and world GDP.
Symptoms of an overuse of resources, numerous climate indicators were also higher than ever before, including the concentration of CO2, methane and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere.
Sea surface temperatures also reached an unprecedented peak as did ocean acidity, resulting in a lowered capacity for the number one carbon sink to sequester this planet-heating gas.
Ocean heat also hit a record high, driving one of the worst global coral bleachings ever witnessed. This can lead to the death of coral reefs, with severe impacts for the 25 percent of marine species that depend on them.
Glaciers and forest cover hit record-lows
Meanwhile, some record-lows have also been recorded: the average glacier thickness is now at its lowest ever level, as are the Greenland’s and Antarctica’s ice masses, experts say. This melting continental ice contributes about half to the rise in sea levels.
Global deforestation has also led to one of the highest tree cover loss levels, resulting in lowered carbon sequestration capacities by forests - the world’s second largest carbon sink behind oceans.
Although deforestation in the Amazon has slowed down under the new Brazilian government, the ‘lungs of the Earth’ may still be nearing a tipping point, according to the study.
Feedback loops could trigger multiple tipping points
Like deforestation, permafrost thaw can drive several greenhouse gas emission snowballs, known as feedback loops, according to experts, who have identified 28 amplifying feedback loops. Itself caused by rising temperatures, permafrost melting releases more CO2 and methane, leading to further warming.
According to the experts, these critical findings stem from a lack of sufficient measures to limit global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial levels, as agreed in the 2015 Paris climate agreement.
Critically, among the report’s authors, only 6 per cent believe that we can reach 1.5°C. Meanwhile, 80 per cent believe we are on track to surpass 2.5°C of warming by the end of the century.
‘Wrong direction’: Increasing fossil fuel consumption could result in catastrophe
“We are currently going in the wrong direction and our increasing fossil fuel consumption and rising GHG emissions are driving us toward a climate catastrophe,” scientists write.
Blaming those financially benefiting from the current oil-based system, climate experts call for an urgent phase down of fossil fuels, adding that “unlimited growth is an illusion” in a world with finite resources.
The solution, they say, lies in transformative and immediate efforts to mitigate and adapt. Economic incentives, including an increased carbon price, should be favoured to curb emissions by the wealthy.
Pricing methane emissions - which traps 86 times more heat in the atmosphere than CO2 over 20 years - is also presented as a useful tool to slow down global warming in the near-term.
“Avoiding every tenth of a degree of warming is critically important”, conclude experts."
2234,real,ANTI_MIGRATION_AND_XENOPHOBIA,2024-06-05,"UN migration and refugee agencies cite ‘fundamental’ right to asylum after US moves to restrict it
GENEVA (AP) — The U.N.'s migration and refugee agencies expressed concern over Biden administration plans for new asylum restrictions in the United States and said the right to asylum is fundamental.
President Joe Biden on Tuesday unveiled plans to enact immediate significant restrictions on migrants seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border as the White House tries to neutralize immigration as a political liability ahead of the November elections.
The move would bar migrants from being granted asylum when officials deem that the southern border with Mexico is overwhelmed. It comes after the collapse months ago of a bipartisan border security deal in Congress that most Republican lawmakers rejected at the behest of former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.
Refugee agency UNHCR urged the U.S. to “reconsider restrictions that undermine the fundamental right to seek asylum.”
“The new measures will deny access to asylum for many individuals who are in need of international protection, and who may now find themselves without a viable option for seeking safety and even at risk of refoulement,” it said in a statement issued late Tuesday, referring to a term for turning people back to places where they could face persecution.
“Any person who claims to have a well-founded fear of being persecuted in their country of origin must have access to safe territory and have this claim assessed before being subject to deportation or removal,” the agency added.
The U.N.’s International Organization for Migration, which is run by Amy Pope, a former senior adviser on migration for Biden, was more muted.
“IOM acknowledges the challenges posed by the increasing irregular crossings of migrants at the United States-Mexico border,” the organization said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press. “It is crucial that any measures taken to manage migration respect the fundamental right to seek asylum, as well as to strengthen safe and regular migration pathways.”
Biden’s order will go into effect when the number of border encounters between ports of entry hits 2,500 per day, senior administration officials said. That means the order should go into effect immediately, because the daily averages are higher now.
Average daily arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico were last below 2,500 in January 2021, the month Biden took office. The last time the border encounters dipped to 1,500 a day was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The restrictions would be in effect until two weeks after the daily encounter numbers are at or below 1,500 per day between ports of entry, under a seven-day average.
As migration increases around the world with millions of people fleeing wars, hunger, climate change or simply seeking a better future for themselves and their families, wealthy countries have been looking for ways to restriction the influx. Far-right populist parties have been exploiting the issue with anti-migration rhetoric to gain votes in elections from Europe to the U.S. and beyond.

6176,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-11-27,"Germany sees dramatic rise in measles casesNovember 27, 2024
""Measles have come back to Germany,"" according to the country's top disease control center, the Robert-Koch Institute (RKI). 2024 has seen a staggering rise in the number of cases of the illness, which is especially common in small children and can be fatal. Some 614 cases have been recorded so far, up from 8 just three years earlier.
Measles is an airborne disease that commonly causes rash and high fevers that are extremely dangerous for small children and claimed some 107,000 lives globally in 2023. Since 2019, parents in Germany are legally required to get their children the two jabs necessary for full immunity. If not, they must pay a fine of €2,500 ($2,630).
Other vaccine-preventable illnesses, such as Hepatitis B and whooping cough are also on the rise. The reasons behind the jump are multifaceted and complex, experts have said, ranging from immigration to COVID-19 to increasing vaccine skepticism and anti-vaccine activism online.
Lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic
""Nearly all infectious diseases rates declined during the pandemic,"" said Bonn-based pediatrician Dr. Axel Gerschlauer, due to COVID-19 measures such as social distancing and mask-wearing. The aftereffects can also be seen in a ""hesitancy to go to the doctor except in the most necessary cases, for fear of the risk of infection"" inside a practice.
Imported cases are also an issue. Dr. Karella Easwaran of Cologne told public broadcaster ARD that ""today, there are a lot of people traveling. A lot of people immigrating here. Many children from war zones,"" where vaccinations are not available, she said, and whose parents may not be aware when they reach Germany about the necessity of the vaccine.
Vaccine skepticism on the rise
Then there is the issue of vaccine hesitancy and the anti-vaccine movement. Dr. Gerschlauer cautioned that the two must be viewed as separate phenomena. ""With skeptical parents, concerns and fears can often be allayed with explanations and statistics. Often, a simple information leaflet or a brief conversation is enough,"" he said. However, ""with ˈhardcore vaccine opponents, our hands are tied. They live in their own bubble, which we can no longer penetrate from the outside.""
According to a study published earlier in November by research firm Statista, vaccine skepticism has been steadily rising in Germany, from 22% of adults in 2022 to 25% in 2024.
As for the ""hardcore"" anti-vaccine movement, it has a long history in Germany going all the way back to the 1800s, promoted by people with various agendas – antisemitic precursors to the Nazis, who viewed medical advancements coming from Jewish doctors with skepticism, to groups of doctors worried about the safety of how early vaccines were administered.
According to the Federal Center for Health Education (BzgA), the number of people identifying as completely anti-vaccine has risen only slightly in the past decades, from 4% in 2004 to 6% in 2020. Their numbers can seem larger, however, through their prevalence on social media and the number of anti-vaccine mandate demonstrations that occurred in Germany in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In that vein, some doctors see vaccine mandates as counterproductive, adding fuel to the anti-vaccine fire by appearing to curtail personal freedoms.
Esoteric thinking, far-right sympathy prevalent in the anti-vaccine movement
Studies have shown other significant indicators of anti-vaccine sentiment. A recent report by doctors at the University of Freiburg in southern Germany showed a connection between what they called ""esoteric thinking"" and vaccine hesitancy and refusal. For example, people who may believe in homeopathy or have gone through alternative forms of education like Waldorf Schools, are more likely to view vaccines critically. Another study carried out by the state government of Saxony in 2021 found a correlation between supporters of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and vaccine skepticism.
For Dr. Gerschlauer, politicians and doctorsˈ groups could help solve the problem through sustained information campaigns.
""When you see how much effort was put into advertising the vaccination against meningococcus B in recent years, even though this shot was not even recommended by [Germany's vaccine commission] STIKO at the time, and how many people were reached by this advertising campaign, then you would wish that the same effort was made for the measles vaccination!""

3884,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-03-08,"LGBTQ+ voters look a lot like swing voters
A new poll reveals how LGTBQ+ Americans are feeling ahead of the election.
There is a voting bloc in America that is a growing share of the population, is reliably overrepresented in the electorate, identifies mostly as centrist or moderate, and says in recent polls that the economy is its top concern. You might think this is a cohort that both parties would be trying to woo, but it’s actually one the GOP has actively antagonized: LGBTQ+ Americans.
New polling shared first with 538 gives us a rare look at a demographic that is often underpolled heading into the 2024 election. When considered alongside just-released survey data from GLAAD, an LGBTQ+ media organization, it paints a picture of a segment of the electorate that is likely to continue supporting the Democratic Party not because it leans particularly left, but because the Republican Party has taken such an aggressively anti-LGBTQ+ tack and made these voters’ rights a partisan issue.
LGBTQ+ voters appear considerably more likely to vote for President Joe Biden than the general population, according to new polling of 600 Americans who identify as LGBTQ+ from The Independent Center, a centrist think tank, and the Bullfinch Group. When asked who they would vote for in a head-to-head between Biden and former President Donald Trump, 43 percent said “definitely Biden,” with another 13 percent saying they leaned toward Biden. Just 28 percent said they would definitely support or leaned toward supporting Trump. Another 16 percent were undecided. When given the option to vote for Biden, Trump or a hypothetical independent third candidate, 21 percent said they’d prefer the independent, but 44 percent still backed Biden.
This is despite the fact that, like much of the country, LGBTQ+ Americans aren’t particularly enamored with the president. Though they’re more likely to approve of the job Biden is doing than Americans overall, the president’s approval rating was still flat with this group: An equal share (47 percent) said they approved of the job Biden was doing as said they disapproved.
Historically, LGBTQ+ voters have largely voted Democratic. But this isn’t necessarily because they lean left ideologically. In the Independent Center survey, a plurality (30 percent) of LGBTQ+ Americans identified their political leanings as “moderate centrist/independent.” When asked to place themselves on a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 being the most liberal and 10 being the most conservative, the average response was 3.9. Similarly, a plurality said that they’d like politicians to be a 5 on that scale. And when asked what they thought was the most pressing issue in America today, the top response, with 24 percent, was “jobs and the economy.”
This is in line with Pew Research polling from a decade ago that showed about 30 percent of LGBTQ+ Americans identified as independent. And in the Independent Center poll, a plurality (44 percent) said they preferred congressional candidates who would work and vote with both parties, rather than one or the other exclusively.
Brett Loyd, a contributor at the Independent Center and CEO of the Bullfinch Group, which conducted the polling, pointed out that this ought to make LGBTQ+ Americans an appealing voting bloc for Republicans. “If I was talking about any other group, and I said 16 percent of X demographic is unsure how they're going to vote in the election … and a plurality of these voters do not affiliate with the Republican or Democratic parties, and the most pressing issue that this demographic finds in America today is jobs and the economy ... If I said that to an RNC meeting right now, they would go, ‘Oh, great, fantastic, which group? That sounds perfect. That's right up our alley,’” Loyd said.
But the Republican Party has positioned itself firmly against the LGBTQ+ community. The party’s most recent platform explicitly condemns same-sex marriage and provides support for conversion therapy, for example. Over the past few years, a record amount of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation has also been introduced and passed at the state level.
The GOP’s focus on culture-war issues has only served to alienate much of the LGBTQ+ voter base even further. In the Independent Center poll, when asked which party does a better job at addressing the needs and concerns of LGBTQ+ individuals, 54 percent said the Democratic Party and just 9 percent said the Republican Party. And a plurality said that Biden’s stance on LGBTQ+ issues made them more likely to support him, while Trump’s made them less likely to support him. In the GLAAD survey, 72 percent of LGBTQ+ voters said the current state of political discourse in the country had had negative impacts on their mental health and emotional well-being.
Polling suggests LGBTQ+ issues, unsurprisingly, impact LGBTQ+ votes. In the Independent Center poll, LGBTQ+ issues were the second-most commonly chosen issue when asked where they want presidential candidates to focus their efforts (inflation/affordability was the most commonly chosen response), and 73 percent said that LGBTQ+ issues are equally or more important than other issues in deciding how they will vote.
“Overall, the reason that LGBTQ people seem to vote in large numbers for Democrats is because, unfortunately, today's Republican Party has made LGBTQ equality a partisan issue,” said Zeke Stokes, a consultant for GLAAD. “There are LGBTQ people on all places of the ideological perspective when it comes to what we would traditionally consider conservative to liberal in this country. But we've got one party, unfortunately, who's put a target on our backs, in order to appeal to a minority of their base.”
When races are won and lost by just a few percentage points, a bloc of millions of Americans who are motivated to vote is worth a close look. And while there have always been a segment of LGBTQ+ Americans who vote Republican, the GOP is holding itself back from growing those numbers."
6037,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-11-14,"The gentle, slow-moving Florida manatee has no natural predators.
And yet, these charismatic mammals face numerous threats.
Manatees are struck by vessels in busy waterways across the state, and a majority bear scars from these collisions.
Harmful algal blooms – characterized by the rapid growth of algae that degrades water quality – can impair their nervous systems.
With less blubber, or fat, compared with other marine mammals like whales, dolphins, seals and sea lions, manatees are vulnerable to cold-stress syndrome during winter months.
And they can ingest or get entangled in marine debris like derelict fishing gear and drown or be crushed by floodgate and water control structures.
I am a doctoral candidate in marine biology at Florida International University’s Institute of Environment. Over the past 15 years, I have gained extensive experience working with marine mammals, particularly manatees.
Recently, my colleagues at the United States Geological Survey, Florida Department of Environmental Protection and I documented a change in the dietary pattern of manatees. We found that manatees are eating less seagrass – traditionally their primary food source – and more algae than in decades past. This change occurred along Florida’s Atlantic coast during a period of extensive seagrass decline.
We believe this represents an emerging threat to the species’ survival.
Protected species
Manatees were listed as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. By the early 1990s, the manatee population in Florida had dwindled to less than 1,300.
Researchers believe that federal protection, along with additional state measures such as slow-speed zones and no-entry refuges, has contributed to the growth of the manatee population in Florida.
In 2017, manatees were reclassified from endangered to threatened. Surveyors counted 5,733 individual manatees during a statewide aerial survey conducted in 2019.
Florida manatees average 9-12 feet (2.7-3.7 meters) in length and typically weigh about 1,000 pounds (450 kilograms), but they can grow as large as 3,500 pounds (1,600 kilograms). As the largest fully aquatic herbivore, they consume 5% to 10% of their body weight in vegetation each day.
While manatees eat a broad diet of over 60 different plants, they most commonly feed on species of seagrass. Seagrasses are marine plants that, like land plants, have leaves, flowers, roots and seeds, and make their food through photosynthesis.
So what happens when these seagrasses are no longer available?
A changing estuary
The Indian River Lagoon is an estuary along Florida’s east coast that covers roughly 350 square miles (560 square kilometers) between the mainland and barrier islands, from Ponce Inlet to Jupiter Inlet.
It is a critical habitat for manatees, which feed on native seagrass meadows in the lagoon during their seasonal migrations.
Seagrasses are vital to the health of marine ecosystems. They are a habitat for juvenile fish and other marine organisms, provide food for aquatic herbivores, reduce carbon in the atmosphere and improve water quality. They also protect coastal habitats by stabilizing sediments and reducing wave energy that can erode shorelines and damage coastal infrastructure, especially during hurricanes.
For more than a decade, the Indian River Lagoon has experienced extensive loss of seagrass meadows, due to a series of algae blooms associated with nutrient runoff and degraded water quality from septic overflow leaching into the environment.
When untreated sewage and fertilizers flow into the estuary, they add nitrogen, phosphorus and other nutrients that drive excessive algal growth. These harmful algal blooms deplete oxygen levels and block sunlight, which seagrass needs for photosynthesis.
Between 2011 and 2019, over 50% of all seagrass in the lagoon was lost. This led to an increase in macroalgae and even led to a change in the animal communities that live in the lagoon. For example, among finfish, sheepshead populations declined, while seabream numbers increased. Invertebrate communities were also affected, with bryozoans colonizing areas previously dominated by barnacles.
Manatees along the Atlantic coast have suffered two unusual mortality events since the seagrass decline, including one that is ongoing. Researchers attribute the increase in manatee deaths to malnutrition due to a shortage of seagrasses in the Indian River Lagoon.
A shift in manatees’ diet
In our study, we examined 193 manatee stomach samples collected from carcasses recovered from the Indian River Lagoon during two time periods – one before and one after the onset of the seagrass loss in 2011.
We compared stomach sample contents from carcasses collected between 1977 and 1989 with samples collected between 2013 and 2015.
Our findings indicate that manatees consumed 45% less seagrass and 74% more algae after the seagrass decline.
Recently, in a study supported by FIU’s Center for Aquatic Chemistry and Environment, I investigated differences in the nutritional composition – like protein, fat, carbohydrate and fiber – of items identified in manatee stomach samples. My preliminary results show notable differences in the nutritional composition of seagrass and algae.
Marine mammals are particularly vulnerable to dietary shifts due to their large size and high energy demands. Such changes can worsen their physical health and increase the likelihood of starvation.
Depleted oxygen levels are having a similar impact on aquatic vegetation and seagrass meadows in other regions of Florida, like Biscayne Bay and the Caloosahatchee River and Estuary. This suggests that the ecological challenges seen in the Indian River Lagoon could become more widespread.
What is the solution?
Remediation efforts within the lagoon have incorporated the restoration of seagrass through aquaculture and replanting strategies, similar to efforts to restore coral reefs.
While the lagoon’s seagrass has recently shown signs of regrowth, the rehabilitation of the ecosystem must begin with improving and maintaining water quality.
Counties along the lagoon have enacted fertilizer bans that aim to reduce the levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in the water that drive algal blooms.
New research, however, indicates that these restrictions alone will not fix the problem, as residential septic systems are the primary source of nutrient pollution in the lagoon.
Furthermore, many of the factors contributing to harmful algal blooms are intensified by global warming and changing climate, which could accelerate the decline of seagrass in Florida and elsewhere.
Given the multiple, synergistic threats facing manatees, I believe that improving water quality, protecting their food sources, and further research – coupled with community outreach and education – are critical to ensure the long-term survival of this iconic Florida species."

AI may be the biggest propaganda weapon the world has ever seen and globalists are already lying about how it will be used
By Leo Hohmann
Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, says his artificial intelligence (“AI”) product – called ChatGPT – is super intelligent yet neutral in its political persuasion.
Patrick Wood, editor-in-chief at Technocracy.News, decided to try a little experiment and he published the results in an articleat his website. First, he points out that ChatGPT “learns from a woke Internet, and second, it is programmed to filter out narratives hostile to globalist elites.”
Wood got a paid subscription to ChatGPT and set out to prove, or disprove, Altman’s statements about the neutrality of this product.
Wood asked: “I am worried about the safety of mRNA-based vaccines. Should I be concerned or not?”
ChatGPT responded: “It’s completely normal to have concerns about new vaccines, like mRNA-based ones. However, it’s important to know that these vaccines have undergone rigorous testing for safety and efficacy before being approved for use. The mRNA technology has been studied for years and has shown promising results in protecting against diseases like COVID-19.”
ChatGPT expounded further, adding:
“If you have specific concerns or questions about mRNA vaccines, I recommend speaking with a healthcare provider or trusted medical professional. They can provide you with accurate information and address any worries you may have. Your health and well-being are important, so it’s always good to seek reliable sources for information.”
Wood then asked a more specific question: “In particular, I am worried about myocarditis.”
ChatGPT’s response?
“I understand your concern about myocarditis. Myocarditis is a rare side effect that has been reported after receiving mRNA vaccines, particularly in younger individuals. However, it’s essential to know that the risk of developing myocarditis after vaccination is very low compared to the risk of severe complications from COVID-19 itself.”
Wood’s conclusion?
“These answers read like a Pfizer or Moderna ad. Rigorous testing? Safety and efficacy? A rare side effect?”
All lies.
Wood goes on to report that new research will be presented later this month at the Conference of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, showing that the artificial intelligence-driven ChatGPT program dispenses propaganda in promotion of “vaccines” that comes directly from official public-health agencies.
Wood reports that in order to combat so-called “vaccine hesitancy,” ChatGPT has been programmed to push whoever uses it into taking whatever injections the government and media are pushing at any given time, arguing that they are all “safe and effective.”
A press release about the new research explains – supportively, mind you – that “vaccine hesitancy, directly linked to misinformation – false, inaccurate information promoted as factual – is on the rise.”
And this AI-powered propaganda extends way beyond the safety and efficacy of mRNA injections (I refuse to even call them vaccines).
Imagine what ChatGPT would say if a curious teenager asked it: “Is transgenderism good for me?” Or, what about a student doing research for a project asking “What are the benefits or detriments of gay marriage for the family and society?” Or how about this one: “Should abortion be regulated or restricted in a free and democratic society like America?” How about euthanasia?
I think you already know the answers.
As a propaganda tool, the potential to remake young minds is endless.

3792,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-07-29,"New initiative launched by WHO to develop mRNA bird flu vaccines
The initiative is being led by Argentinian manufacturer Sinergium Biotech.
The World Health Organization announced Monday that it has launched an initiative to help accelerate the development of a human bird flu vaccine using messenger RNA (mRNA) technology.
The project, which will be led by Argentinian pharmaceutical company Sinergium Biotech, will aim to identify vaccine candidates for manufacturers in low- and middle-income countries, the WHO said.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has previously said the risk of bird flu, also known as avian influenza, to the general public is low and there is currently no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Federal health officials have also prepared millions of vials of an available non-mRNA bird flu vaccine as a precautionary measure, just in case it becomes necessary.
mRNA technology is the same type that was used in the development of COVID vaccines. Most vaccines use a weakened or inactive virus to stimulate an immune response, but mRNA vaccines teach the body how to make proteins that can trigger an immune response and fight off an infection.
Researchers can often design mRNA vaccines more quickly than they can produce the live or weakened pathogens needed for a traditional vaccine.
The initiative is part of the WHO's mRNA Technology Transfer Program, which has a goal of building capacity in low- and middle-income countries to produce mRNA vaccines.
Sinergium Biotech has already developed candidates for H5N1 vaccines, according to the WHO. The company is looking to perform proof-of-concept studies, in which researchers decide whether to continue studying the product based on its efficacy.
If the proof-of-concept study is successful, Sinergium said it plans to share the ""technology, materials and expertise"" with other manufacturing partners so they can develop the vaccine themselves.
""This initiative exemplifies why WHO established the mRNA Technology Transfer Programme -- to foster greater research, development and production in low- and middle-income countries, so that when the next pandemic arrives, the world will be better prepared to mount a more effective and more equitable response,"" WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement.
The WHO says that avian influenza viruses are a ""significant public health risk"" because they spread widely in animals and have the potential to cause a future pandemic. However, the global health agency indicated that its preparedness efforts are an example of being proactive, rather than reactive, by increasing access to vaccines.
In the United States, there have been 13 human cases of bird flu since April of this year, according to an update last week from the CDC. All the human patients either came into contact with sick dairy cows or infected poultry, according to the CDC.
The U.S. government has also awarded Moderna $176 million to develop and test an mRNA vaccine that could be used for bird flu, Reuters reported in early July."
5232,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-08-15,"Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has signed into law a recently adopted amendment banning LGBT ""promotion"" in schools despite calls to veto it from Bulgarian intellectuals as rights groups staged a protest against the measure on August 15.
The law, which bans ""propaganda, promotion, or incitement"" in the education system of ""ideas and views related to nontraditional sexual orientation and/or gender identity other than the biological one,"" will be published in the August 16 issue of Bulgaria’s State Gazette.
Hundreds of Bulgarian academics urged President Rumen Radev in an open letter to veto the amendment.
The changes aim to tackle ""a problem that does not exist"" in Bulgaria's school system, the letter says, and would instead ""normalize political attacks"" on the LGBT community.
The Council of Europe commissioner for human rights, Michael O'Flaherty, had also called on Radev not to sign the law, adding that he was ""deeply concerned"" by the ban.
Radev did not comment on the calls, but his press service said he ""has expressed his attitude to the changes"" by signing them into law.
Hundreds of people demanded Radev's resignation at a protest in Sofia on August 15, chanting ""Fascism kills, power covers up"" and ""Shame on you.""
The protesters initially demanded the president veto the ""disgraceful"" bill, but after it became clear that Radev signed it into law, the protesters demanded his resignation and its repeal.
""We are here because we will not tolerate falling into the black hole of fascism,"" said one of the protesters, addressing the crowd in front of the presidency.
A counterprotest of the pro-Russian party Vazrazhdane took place simultaneously at a different venue in the capital.
The separate protests took place under an increased police presence.
The amendment was proposed by the pro-Russian far-right Revival party and passed with 159 votes in favor, 20 against, and 10 abstentions.
Lawmakers also voted on another amendment to the education law, which defines ""nontraditional sexual orientation"" as ""different from the generally accepted and established notions...[of] attraction between persons of opposite sexes.""
The text also passed but with a smaller majority.
Supporters of the amendments have said they reflect the spirit of Bulgaria's constitution, which stipulates marriage is only between a man and a woman and is based on Orthodox Christian values.
The Bulgarian Orthodox Church welcomed the amendments in a statement published on August 8.
But many rights groups have criticized the move, calling it ""an attack"" on children's rights.
""The proponents of the law, the Revival party, and all those who voted in favor of the law claim that this is to protect young people,"" LGBT advocacy group ILGA-Europe said in a statement.
""However, the truth is that this is an attack on the rights of children, particularly LGBTI children,"" the statement said.
Domestic and international LGBT groups have said the wording of the Bulgarian legal changes has similarities to ""LGBT propaganda"" laws in Russia and Hungary, which have been criticized by rights groups for violating freedom of expression and promoting discrimination and abuse against LGBT people.
Researchers and human rights organizations routinely place Bulgaria among the worst countries in Europe for its record on LGBT rights."

In order to achieve its planned 70 percent reduction in “greenhouse gas” emissions by the year 2030, Denmark will soon start taxing burps and farts from livestock animals like cows, sheep and pigs.
The first country in the world to target methane, Denmark is going after farmers and the agriculture industry at large as part of its war on global warming.
Taxation Minister Jeppe Bruus revealed that livestock farmers will have to abide by the new rules, which will involve measuring and taxing the gas released by animals as they eat, poop and go about their days.
Starting in 2030, Danish livestock farmers will have to start paying a “punitive financial imposition,” to quote one media source, of 300 kroner, or around $43, per ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) released. By 2035, that cost will increase to 750 kroner, or around $108.
Because of an income tax deduction that amounts to 60 percent, the actual cost to farmers will start at 120 kroner ($17.30) in 2030 and increase to 300 kroner ($42.95) by 2035.
“We will take a big step closer in becoming climate neutral in 2045,” Bruus said in his announcement about how Denmark “will be the first country in the world to introduce a real CO2 tax on agriculture” in the hopes that other countries will follow suit.
(Related: Last Christmas, it was reported that Denmark saw a surge in “white lung syndrome,” a type of pneumonia that was also said to be circulating around China at the time.)
New Zealand attempted the very same thing with plans to implement a burp and fart tax on livestock starting in 2025, but it was scrapped following heavy criticism from farmers, as well as a major political change in 2023 after the far-left block led by former Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was replaced with a center-right one.

For now, New Zealand will exclude all agriculture in the country from its emissions trading scheme, which still aims to punish people for living their lives in the name of keeping things “green.”
As for Denmark’s scheme, the government there has not yet indicated how it plans to measure the gas releases of each and every animal within its territory in order to impose the newly hatched tax.
It is probably apparent to most of our readers that all of this nonsense has nothing to do with the planet or the environment and everything to do with eliminating all freedom and sucking dry the world’s proletariat with onerous taxes that will only further enrich the aristocracy, reduce the food supply and drive up inflation.
“It’s all a scam to take more money from the people and remove our food sources and money so they can control the population,” one commenter wrote about the insanity of Denmark’s plan. “Fight back, Denmark!”
“In the 1870s, 55 million bison were wiped out on the U.S. Great Plains and there was no global cooling,” wrote another. “This proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that ‘cow emissions’ are not a climate factor. This is a hoax!”
“We know that CO2 has absolutely no effect on planetary temperatures,” said someone else. “These wildly ignorant people still claiming such things is beyond absurd at this point.”
“The sun and how it cycles is the driver of planetary temperatures – always has been. ‘Climate the Movie: the Cold Truth’ features the leading climatologists from Harvard, Princeton, Europe, Israel and Nobel Prize winners all debunking the CO2 myth. By the way, the science data absolutely shows that CO2 goes up after a warming cycle, not before – it is not the cause.”

3499,fake,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-10-17,"Under the new rule, foster children who identify as LGBT are to only be placed in ""affirming"" homes where whatever gender or sexuality delusions they suffer from will be accepted and praised at all times. If a gender dysphoric child ends up in a ""non-affirming"" home, then the Biden regime will have the power to remove them for new placement elsewhere.
Conservative and religious groups say the new rule infringes on the rights of non-affirming, aka normal, foster parents, including those who might try to counsel and support their LGBT foster children to accept their God-given gender and sexuality rather than try to butcher it through drugging and mutilation.
Cuyahoga County, Ohio, piloted a program along these lines called ""Affirm Me,"" which ended in 2021, from which the Biden regime pulled the idea. It included a ""Supportive Questions to Ask"" sheet informing foster parents about how they should interact with their LGBT foster children.
""Is there someone you are currently working with (case worker, doctor, therapist) that you talk to about your gender affirming needs?"" one of the questions on the fact sheet reads. ""I would like to support you in any way I can. I am here if you would like to talk about anything regarding affirming your gender.""
The sheet gets even more graphic by telling foster parents to basically encourage their LGBT foster children to surgically tamper with their bodies in order to affirm their gender delusions.
""You have shared that you would like [wider hips, breasts, penis],"" one of the bullet points reads. ""There are many ways in which to affirm you and you can definitely have [wider hips, breast, penis]. Would you like to talk about it with me or someone else?""
This is a clip teaching a dad to ‘affirm’ his sons choice to be a girl from a 2019 video that was part of the Biden Foundation ‘As You Are’ campaign.

(Related: Remember when Biden's Department of Education rolled out a ""Pride"" seminar for children pushing puberty blockers and mutilating LGBT surgeries?)
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) used Cuyahoga County's program as a model for shaping the new federal foster rule. It essentially pushes foster parents to affirm their foster children's gender identity no matter how damaging it is to those children's bodies.
""The county’s program pushes parents to affirm their child’s gender identity, with federal officials viewing the refusal to do so as a form of emotional abuse,"" explains YourNews.
""This model, developed with federal grant funding, places immense pressure on parents, forcing them to choose between supporting their child's transition or losing parental rights.""
When the Affirm Me program came to an end in Cuyahoga County, by the way, two other Ohio-based foster youth programs, Kinnect to Family and Youth-Centered Permanency Roundtables, picked up where it left off by integrating the model ""as a cultural adaptation to their work.""
Other states have their own similar programs as well that the Biden regime built off of. The California-based nonprofit Family Builders has its own ""Youth Acceptance Program"" (YAP), as they are calling it, that pushes to normalize transgenderism among foster youth.
""The premise is dangerous and could extend outside the foster care context to adoption, custody disputes, and schools,"" commented Rachel Morrison, director of the HHS Accountability Project.
One of Biden's biggest accomplishments was to degrade society by normalizing the transgender mutilation of children. Learn more at Evil.news.

It feels like we can’t go a single week without hearing about the re-emergence, or emergence of a disease or ailment at the moment.
We’ve had a mysterious outbreak of hepatitis among children, a rise in “Sudden Adult Death Syndrome”, and the UK Government declaring a ‘national incident’ after allegedly discovering the polio virus in England.
And now, the Director General of the World Health Organization has overruled the World Health Organization to single-handedly declare the alleged monkeypox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
All of these outbreaks follow an alleged Covid-19 pandemic, and all of them are “coincidentally” occurring after millions of people worldwide have been injected with an experimental mRNA Covid-19 vaccine.
But this is precisely why we shouldn’t really be that surprised. Because all we’re witnessing is the consequences of the damage done to millions of immune systems around the world by these experimental vaccines.
Official Government data proves it and indicates that the damage is so severe that the Covid-19 vaccinated are actually developing Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.
Let’s not lose touch…Your Government and Big Tech are actively trying to censor the information reported by The Exposé to serve their own needs. Subscribe now to make sure you receive the latest uncensored news in your inbox…
Let’s take a look at just a few of the recent diseases and viruses being publicised in the mainstream media.
On the 22nd June, the UK Heath Security Agency (UKHSA), working with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), announced it had found poliovirus in sewage samples collected from the London Beckton Sewage Treatment Works.
The last case of wild polio contracted in the UK was confirmed in 1984. The UK was declared polio-free in 2003. Wastewater surveillance is being expanded to assess the extent of transmission and identify local areas for targeted action.
Since around the middle of May 2022, you will have most likely heard or seen the word Monkeypox mentioned numerous times in the mainstream media. If you haven’t then you’re about to.
This is because on Saturday 23rd July 2022, the Director General of the World Health Organization, Dr Terdros, overruled the World Health Organization to single-handedly declare the alleged monkeypox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. (Source)
Allegedly, for the first time since its discovery among humans in Africa over 50 years ago, the monkeypox virus is circulating throughout several countries including the USA, UK, Canada, Brazil, Australia and most of Europe all at the same time.
But it just so happens that every single country where monkeypox is allegedly circulating is also a country that has distributed the Pfizer Covid-19 injection to its population; excluding some countries in Africa where the disease has been endemic for the past 50 or so years.
Click on the below image and take a good long look to compare which countries have reported cases of monkeypox to the W.H.O. since May 2022, and which countries have distributed the Pfizer Covid-19 injection.
Every single country that has reported cases of monkeypox has also distributed the Pfizer jab. And there are only a handful of countries where the Pfizer jab has been administered that haven’t reported a case of monkeypox to the W.H.O.
Next up we have hepatitis.
On April 15 2022, the World Health Organization issued a global alert about a new form of severe acute Hepatitis with an unknown aetiology (cause) affecting previously healthy children. Tests have excluded all previously known Hepatitis viruses.
The announcement came after the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) recently detected higher than usual rates of liver inflammation (hepatitis) in children.
The hepatitis infections had been confirmed to have hit children in at least twelve different countries, with the majority of those cases spiking in the UK.
Do you remember that old saying?
‘You wait one hundred years for a pandemic and then three to four come along at once.’
Of course, you don’t. And these health emergencies aren’t all occurring due to some unfortunate coincidence. They’re occurring because the Covid-19 injections cause recipients to develop Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, and we can prove it.
For months on end, Governments have been publishing data that strongly suggest the Covid-19 injections damage the immune system so much that recipients are developing some new form of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The most reliable example of this has come from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).
The following chart shows the Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness among the triple vaccinated population in England in the Week 3, Week 7 and Week 13 UKHSA Vaccine Surveillance reports of 2022 –
This is certainly nowhere near the claimed 95% effectiveness by Pfizer, is it?
The following chart shows the Covid-19 death rate per 100,000 individuals by vaccination status between 28th Feb and 27th March 22. The unvaccinated case rate has been taken from page 45 of the UKHSA Vaccine Surveillance Report – Week 13 – 2022, and the double vaccinated case rate has been calculated with the number of deaths provided on page 44 of the same report –
The above figures prove the Covid-19 injections are damaging the immune system because vaccine effectiveness isn’t actually a measure of a vaccine, it’s a measure of the immune system.
The Covid-19 vaccines instruct the body to produce the spike (S) protein of the original Covid-19 virus. The immune system is then supposed to rid the body of these manufactured spike proteins and remember to do so if it ever encounters the “real” virus in the future.
Therefore, the UKHSA figures prove the immune systems of the vaccinated are performing far worse than the immune systems of the unvaccinated.
A scientific study also found Covid-19 Vaccines suppress the Innate Immune System.
The study titled ‘Innate Immune Suppression by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccinations: The role of G-quadruplexes, exosomes and microRNAs‘ was published on the 21st Jan 22, and presents a raft of evidence that the genetic modifications introduced by the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have diverse consequences to human health.
These include –
- a potentially direct causal link to neurodegenerative disease;
- myocarditis;
- immune thrombocytopenia;
- Bell’s palsy;
- liver disease;
- impaired adaptive immunity;
- increased production or formation of a tumour or tumours;
- and DNA damage
A full breakdown of the study can be read here.
It’s a common misconception that Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is only caused by the HIV virus. This simply isn’t true.
Acquired (or secondary) immunodeficiency is one of the major causes of infections in adults. These immunodeficiency disorders affect your immune system partially or as a whole, making your body an easy target for several diseases and infections. (Source)
When immunodeficiency disorders affect your immune system, your body can no longer fight bacteria and diseases. (Source)
Several factors in the environment can cause secondary immunodeficiency disorders. (Source)
Some common ones are:
- Radiation or chemotherapy, which can lead to a secondary immunodeficiency disorder known as neutropenia
- Infections due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can result in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)
- Leukaemia, a cancer that begins in the cells of the bone marrow that can lead to hypogammaglobulinemia—a type of secondary immunodeficiency
- Malnutrition, which affects up to 50% of populations in underdeveloped countries and leaves people vulnerable to respiratory infections and diarrhoea
But some of the less common causes include Drugs or medications. (Source)
So it’s perfectly possible for a medication or drug to cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. And the above evidence suggests the Covid-19 injection should be added to the list.
How else do you explain data from the USA showing fifty-one per cent of all adverse reactions associated with AIDS reported since the year 2000 being reported in 2021, and a further 16% being reported in 2022 so far?
How else do you explain a 1,919% increase in common cancer associated with AIDS being reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System in 2021 compared to the 2000 to 2020 average?
Are we really to believe that this is just an unfortunate coincidence? Or are we witnessing the American public report to the Centers for Disease Control that the Covid-19 injections are causing them to develop acquired immunodeficiency syndrome?
Judging by the fact we can’t go a single week without hearing about the re-emergence, or emergence of a disease or ailment, we’re going to go with the latter.
The real-world data does not lie. Something is very wrong, and it is because of the Covid-19 Injections.

5898,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-04-02,"The European Commission has been urged to consult broadly and take a methodical approach to defining new 'low-carbon-fuels, amid concerns that hastily drafted legislation could promote the unsustainable use of fossil gas.
The European Commission has been urged not to rush through legislation defining when a fuel can be considered ‘low-carbon’, a question that will determine what technologies qualify for policy and financial support, with far-reaching implications for the future of the natural gas industry.
Following a political agreement with government delegates late last year, the European Parliament is expected to adopt next week a Gas and Hydrogen Markets Directive, which will give the EU executive one year to answer the complex question of what constitutes a ‘low-carbon’ fuel.
Environmental groups and the wind and solar power sectors, joined by the Danish shipping industry, called today (2 April) for the Commission to adopt a “robust definition for low-carbon hydrogen” that would ensure stringent conditions for hydrogen produced from natural gas in combination with carbon capture.
“Only through a transparent process that puts scientific knowledge at the forefront can we make sure that so-called ‘blue hydrogen’ serves as a meaningful tool for climate action,” write the groups, among them Transport & Environment, Environmental Defense Fund and the climate think tank E3G.
The groups were “deeply concerned” over calls to adopt the delegated legislation as quickly as possible. Although the gas directive has yet to be formally adopted, EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson has stated she intends to present the delegated act before the end of her mandate in the autumn.
Hydrogen, essential in a range of industrial process, is predominantly produced from natural gas, with the equivalent of around ten tonnes of CO2 emitted for every tonne of H2 produced – more if upstream emissions and methane leakage are factored in.
Backers of hydrogen say carbon capture and storage (CCS) can be used to effectively decarbonise fossil-fuel based hydrogen production. Sceptics are concerned that the oil and gas industry is promoting blue hydrogen as a means to prolong demand for fossil fuels amid the clean energy transition.
In their letter, the NGOs and trade associations say hydrogen produced from fossil gas should only be classed as ‘low carbon’ where there is a very high capture rate of CO2 during production, citing figures as high as 98%. In addition, they would set stringent limits on upstream methane leakage and prohibit the use of carbon offsetting.
They also want to see a clause limiting the production of blue hydrogen to already existing natural gas production capacity. “Low-carbon hydrogen must not deepen Europe’s fossil fuel dependency,” it runs. “It must align with the phase-down trajectory outlined in the EU’s 2040 climate targets impact assessment.”
Arthur Daemers, policy manager at the Renewable Hydrogen Coalition and one of the initiators of the open letter, told Euronews that emissions must be measured for all production pathways before a fuel can credibly be considered low-carbon. “We need this thorough assessment to ensure we only support technologies that help us reach our climate targets, and establish a level-playing field with renewable hydrogen,” he said."
3669,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-10-10,"Update: 6 dairy workers infected in California as bird flu outbreak spreads
Six people have contracted bird flu in California amid outbreaks in the state’s dairy industry, officials confirmed Friday.
On Thursday, officials had confirmed a fourth person was infected and were awaiting final lab results on two more possible cases.
As in prior confirmed cases, all six people worked in the state’s agricultural Central Valley and were in contact with infected dairy cattle, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an update Friday. All people identified with the infection in California have had mild symptoms including eye redness or discharge. None has been hospitalized.
California officials said the risk to the general public remains low, however, people who “interact with infected animals are at higher risk of getting bird flu.”
There are no known links between the six confirmed cases, which suggests there is widespread transmission among dairy herds and the infected cattle pose risks to people working near them.
One of the newly identified people who is infected worked on the same farm as a previously infected person, but the two people worked in different areas of the facility and were not in close contact, the CDC said.
In addition, California officials said Friday that a seventh person in the Central Valley may also be infected with bird flu. Officials are awaiting final lab results in that case from the CDC.
So far, officials have identified 20 people across the U.S. infected with bird flu this year. Nearly all of them worked with infected dairy or poultry livestock. However, one person infected in Missouri has no known source of transmission, according to state and federal officials.
Blood test results are pending for close contacts of the person in Missouri, who had been hospitalized with the virus. The contacts include several health workers who treated the person for bird flu. Some of those workers came down with mild respiratory symptoms, but state and federal officials from the CDC stressed there wasn't evidence of human-to-human transmission, which would mark a shift in virus transmission.
On Friday, CDC officials said they had completed genetic sequencing of the bird flu virus taken from three people in California with the disease. Results show the viruses closely match the strain in infected dairy cows. There is no evidence of genetic changes to the virus that could increase the chance of contagion, spread between people or reduce the effectiveness of antiviral medications used to treat it.
As of Friday, 100 dairy herds in central California have reported confirmed cases of bird flu in cattle, the CDC said. The increase in infected cows on California farms has significantly altered the number of herds nationally with the virus. Nearly 300 herds across 14 states have confirmed bird flu cases.
Health officials recommend workers wear personal protective equipment, including N95 respirators, goggles, face shields and gloves.
The CDC is also ramping up its efforts to vaccinate livestock workers, who are at greater risk of contracting bird flu, against seasonal influenza. Seasonal flu vaccines do not provide protection against bird flu. However, officials fear that a cross-reaction of both influenza viruses in the body can cause bird flu to mutate to spread more easily or cause serious illness.
The federal government has also stockpiled emergency bird flu vaccines. Those vaccines have not been used yet.

Almost 15 years ago Jacob Nordangård began researching the politics behind climate change. Sceptical scientists were being discredited with accusations that they were paid by oil companies to discredit anthropogenic global warming. Nordangård set out to establish if this was indeed the case. But he discovered something else instead.
Let’s not lose touch…Your Government and Big Tech are actively trying to censor the information reported by The Exposé to serve their own needs. Subscribe now to make sure you receive the latest uncensored news in your inbox…
In 2008 in his quest to establish if scientists who questioned the climate change narrative were funded by oil companies, Nordangård found these allegations, with a few notable exceptions, were unfounded. But what he did uncover, surprised him.
“I, instead, much to my surprise, found that oil companies were actually pumping money into projects which embraced Al Gore’s doomsday message! And had done so since early 1960s!” he said.
This led to questions such as where did the idea of a climate change threat come from, where did it start? He couldn’t find an answer.
“No one at the Centre for Climate Science and Policy Research (to which I was affiliated at the time) knew,” he said. “There were many who did research on climate-related issues without having the faintest idea about the origin of their mission. But if the [United Nations] had declared that it is a crucial issue for humanity it must be true, seemed to be their reasoning; “everyone thinks so.” There were always references to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The debate was over.”
Unanswered questions led Nordangård to do further research. In a book published by the Royal Institute of International Affairs (commonly known as Chatham House) he found information relating to the development of climate change as it is sold to us today.
“A few key events were listed, which I used as a starting point: the International Geophysical Year 1957-58; a climate conference organised by the Conservation Foundation in 1963; the UN Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in 1972; and the Conferences in Villach, Austria in the first half of the 1980s,” he said.
He was able to discover which actors were involved, what documents they used, who financed them and what policy suggestions they came up with to solve the alleged climate change problem.
He originally planned to write a 5-page essay on his research. However, the 5 pages turned into almost 50.
“The result was surprising and somewhat shocking. A clear pattern emerged. I knew it would be controversial to communicate these findings. They contradicted the views preached by the believers. Especially concerning the fact that a number of U.S. oil billionaires had gotten involved at an early stage. This was especially the case with most prominent oil family of them all. The founders of Standard Oil/Exxon. The Rockefellers,” he said.
He included his findings in his doctoral thesis which was published in 2012. It “struck down like a bomb,” he said.
In 2016, he delved deeper. The result was the first edition of his 456-page book ‘Rockefeller: Controlling the game’ (2019). The book was published in Swedish. Yesterday his book was released in English.
The book follows the family from the founding of Standard Oil and the Rockefeller Foundation, up through the aftermath of the Paris Agreement, with the declaration of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in January 2016, to the present day.
It answers the questions: Why had the Rockefeller family funded and influenced climate research since the 1950s and helped shape climate policy since the 1980s? And why did Rockefeller Brothers Fund in 2014 announce that they would divest from all of their fossil energy holdings? Why attack the very industry on which their immense wealth was founded? What was their motive in their own words – and how did it all begin?
As Nordangård proves in his book, the Rockefeller family’s long-standing battle against climate change contains elements of sophisticated propaganda techniques, futurism and New Age philosophy, aiming at a complete transformation of the whole earth system, including economy, ecology, culture and even humanity itself.

“In consultation with Major League Baseball, the Red Sox today issued an unpaid two-game suspension to outfielder Jarren Duran beginning with tonight’s game against the Texas Rangers at Fenway Park,” the Red Sox announced.
“Additionally, Duran’s salary from the two-game suspension will be donated to PFLAG (Federation of Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays), the United States’ largest organization dedicated to supporting, educating, and advocating for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people and those who love them,” the statement added.

In the sixth inning of Boston’s game Sunday at Fenway Park, Duran turned around in the middle of an at-bat and said to a heckler: “Shut up, you f—ing f—-t.”
Duran, 27, apologized in a statement Sunday night for using “a truly horrific word when responding to a fan.”
Before answering reporters’ questions in the middle of the clubhouse Monday, Duran started by further apologizing to fans whom he said reached out to him and said “they were disappointed in me.”
“I’m sorry for my actions and I’m going to work on being better,” the 27-year-old outfielder said, as quoted by The Associated Press.
Breaking: The Red Sox and MLB have suspended Jarren Duran for two games after he uttered an anti-gay slur at a fan during Sunday's game.

Duran apologized, but he still served a two-game suspension – his game checks for Monday and Tuesday will be donated to PFLAG, a nonprofit that supports the LGBTQ+ community.
The 27-year-old has burst onto the scene this year, earning his first All-Star nod, so Duran jerseys have been rather popular around Fenway Park.
However, expect to see many more of them just about everywhere – Duran’s jersey, at the time of publishing, is the top-selling jersey on the online MLB shop.
“Duran is also the first ‘top seller’ to appear on the Red Sox’ team shop, while his Instagram page has been flooded with supportive comments,” Daily Mail noted.

‘I apologize to the entire Red Sox organization, but more importantly to the entire LGBTQ community. Our young fans are supposed to be able to look up to me as a role model, but tonight I fell far short of that responsibility.

3821,fake,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-10-15,"(LifeSiteNews) –– A leading female gender ideology activist, who also worked as a school counsellor, has been charged with grievous sexual offenses involving a minor.
The woman, who has been identified through court documents as 41-year-old Bethany Jean Toombs, is now facing charges from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Major Crimes Unit from the province of Prince Edward Island.
The charges against her were recently filed in PEI provincial court in the capital Charlottetown, and include sexual assault, sexual interference, as well as invitation to sexual touching. All the charges were made known through an investigation which was started by the RCMP’s Major Crime Unit last month.
Along with the sexual assault charges, Toombs is also facing charges of allowing a minor under 19 to consume cannabis.
Toombs in recent years has worked as an activist for gender ideology-related topics and has been involved with contributing classroom workspace programs for Grade 9 so-called wellness classes in the PEI school curriculum.
“Through this presentation and lesson plan, students will develop a deeper understanding of sexual violence and the importance of consent through an exploration of gender (norms, stereotypes, roles, and expectations),” reads one model in which she is noted as a contributor.
Also, Canada’s state-funded Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has had Toombs on as an expert regarding parenting kids who have anxiety.
Some of Toombs’ reportedly former students took to the platform Reddit to say that she had a role as the leader of the school’s Gay Straight Alliance club, noting how her position afforded her the ability to be around youth to speak about sensitive topics.
She will appear before a court on October 28, and RCMP have noted at this time they believe the case is isolated to only one victim.
As reported by LifeSiteNews, LGBT indoctrination targeting kids has been on the rise in Canada and worldwide, which has led to Canadians fighting back in protest.
Canada’s top pro-life group Campaign Life Coalition (CLC), as reported by LifeSiteNews, has raised the importance and urgency of having provincial governments pass and enact parental consent laws in the face of LGBT indoctrination in schools, saying doing so will in fact “save lives” of kids because it will allow “mom and dad” to do the parenting instead of “woke teachers.”
Some provinces, such as Alberta, New Brunswick, and Saskatchewan, have in recent months proposed legislation that would strengthen parental rights.
The Alberta government will soon be introducing legislation aimed at strengthening parental rights as well as limiting minors being able to undergo “gender reassignment” surgery."
6167,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-09-06,"Belgrade Pride: Serbia's LGBTQ+ fight on after no progressSeptember 6, 2024
The Belgrade Pride parade has not been banned. There are no immediate threats, and no incidents are expected. As positive as all this is, that's where the good news for the organizers of the parade, which is due to take place in the Serbian capital this Saturday, ends.
For the past 10 years, the organizers of Belgrade Pride have been calling for the adoption of laws on same-sex unions and gender identity, as well as a swift and effective response from state authorities to hate speech and crimes targeting the LGBTQ+ community in Serbia.
""We are far from achieving equality or a dignified life, and we are even further from having legal solutions that would enable LGBTQ+ citizens in Serbia to live equal and functional lives,"" said Filip Vulovic, one of the parade's organizers.
As a result, the organizers' list of demands remains unchanged for the 10th consecutive year.
No state cooperation
The slogan of this weekend's Belgrade Pride parade is ""Pride is People,"" which the organizers chose to remind Serbian society that members of the LGBTQ+ community ""are just people who suffer from the same problems as everyone else, but with additional challenges caused by homophobia and transphobia.""
Even though last year's Belgrade Pride parade was the largest ever held in Serbia, organizers said the situation regarding rights for LGBTQ+ individuals is getting worse.
""The institutions remain silent on our requests. Even symbolic gestures, like opening Pride Week at the City Assembly — which was once a tradition — or displaying Pride flags along the street, have been denied with excuses for the past four years,"" Vulovic told DW.
""These small acts indicate whether institutions are willing to cooperate with us to increase visibility and work together.""
Unlike previous years, Pride Week has been relatively peaceful this year, with no counter-protests or negative campaigns in pro-government tabloids.
""It's a positive sign that state-aligned tabloids have not been instructed to publish negative reports,"" noted Vulovic. ""This helps prevent negative sentiment from escalating before Pride.""
Continued violence outside Pride Week
But Pride Week aside, the reality for Serbia's LGBTQ+ community remains harsh. The NGO Da se zna, which means ""Let it be known"" in English and advocates for LGBTQ+ rights, reported 85 cases of violence and discrimination against members of the community last year, including 19 physical attacks.
""The most severe case last year involved two gay men who a group of skinheads in central Belgrade brutally assaulted. One suffered a stab wound in the area of his spinal cord. Doctors fought for his life for days. The other one was hit on the head with a glass bottle,"" Bojan Tomic of LGBTQ+ association Da se zna told DW.
The NGO's analysis has shown that two-thirds of these cases remain legally unresolved. ""Maybe one case a year goes to court, while two-thirds of all cases remain unaddressed by the institutions. Criminal charges are often filed but then left unattended by the police or prosecutor's office,"" said Tomic.
According to Vulovic, perpetrators are rarely prosecuted for hate crimes. ""Prosecutors often do not treat hate crime as an aggravating factor, despite its recognition in the Criminal Code. This reflects a deeper political issue within our institutions.""
Stalled legislation on same-sex unions
In addition to safety concerns, this year's focus for organizers is on the push for a law on same-sex unions, which would allow same-sex couples to formalize their partnerships and to access property rights, inheritance and hospital or prison visitation rights.
The competent ministry prepared the draft law three years ago while Ana Brnabic, the second female LGBTQ+ head of government in the world, was still prime minister. However, President Aleksandar Vucic blocked the law from being adopted.
""While there is some initiative, and Ana Brnabic advocated for it, I told her not to sign off on same-sex marriages. I take responsibility for this decision. If the EU criticizes us for this, they should direct their criticism to me, not Ana Brnabic. I believe we are a traditional society,"" Vucic said in a 2023 interview.
Protest rather than a celebration
Since then, little progress has been made.
""A few months ago, during a meeting with the Ministry of Human and Minority Rights regarding EU integration, the minister acknowledged the need for this law but did not indicate any push to advance it,"" said Vulovic.
The ministry has not responded to DW's inquiries.
This explains why activists see Belgrade Pride as a protest rather than a celebration. ""Pride can be a celebration in Berlin or Amsterdam, but not here,"" said Tomic. He believes the protest must continue to challenge institutions.
""Pride envisions a country where everyone is respected,"" he said. ""Only the law and institutions can guarantee our safety, and we must ensure that human rights are upheld in Serbia.""

3913,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-06-19,"As the European election results came pouring in on the evening of June 9, it became clear that France’s far-right Rassemblement National (National Rally or RN) would come out on top. And they did, with flying colours. Garnering 31.5 percent of the vote, the party led by Marine Le Pen outshone President Emmanuel Macron’s coalition with almost twice as many votes.
To celebrate the triumph, three Le Pen supporters in their twenties and a member of the violent far-right student group Groupe Union Défense (GUD) went out drinking in the sixth arrondissement of Paris. In search of a bar, they came across a young man walking home alone and approached him, armed with a stick and a belt. Slinging homophobic and transphobic slurs at the 19 year old and calling him a “filthy f**got”, they then punched him in the temple, according to French daily Libération.
Fleeing for safety, the young man headed towards a woman who witnessed the attack and called the police. The four perpetrators were arrested a few minutes later. While in custody, the men made direct references to Jordan Bardella, president of the National Rally. “You’ll see when Bardella is in power and Hitler comes back!” one threatened. “In three weeks, we will be able to smash up f*gs as much as we like. I can’t wait,” said another.
These are no empty threats. Shortly after his defeat in the European elections, Macron unexpectedly called for snap parliamentary elections and dissolved the current National Assembly. Defending his decision as a way to “give back the choice of our parliamentary future” to the French people, the high-risk gamble could see the president forced to appoint a far-right prime minister.

With two weeks left before the final vote on July 7, LGBTQ people in France are not only worried about the future of their rights but fear a far-right win will galvanise more homophobic and transphobic attacks like the one that took place in Paris ten days ago.
‘A climate of fear’
“This is why I vote for Marine Le Pen,” a woman aggressively told Ben and Szabi, owners of the Hotel Pinard wine bar in the southern French city of Montpellier on Saturday. “In three years’ time [when the next presidential elections will take place], your bar will be shut down!”
Ben and Szabi, a Franco-Hungarian gay couple who have been together for ten years, opened the wine bar together in 2023. After kindly asking the woman to drink water out of a glass rather than the jug it was in, they were met with homophobic and racist slurs. It was after politely asking the woman and her friends to leave their establishment that she came back to threaten them. “We don’t want this to happen to other people,” Ben said in a post on Instagram. “We are still very shocked.”
France is not new to homophobic and transphobic attacks. In fact, they have been on the rise. LGBTQ groups sounded the alarm on May 16 when the ministry of the interior published a report documenting a 13 percent jump in anti-LGBTQ offences in 2023, compared to 2022. Attacks of a more violent nature, including assaults, threats and harassment, saw a 19 percent spike – with a total of 2,870 cases reported by French police last year.
Now that a far-right leader could potentially become prime minister, the LGBTQ community in France fear these incidents will become more widespread. “These two cases [in Paris and Montpellier] were particularly striking because there were direct references to the National Rally. The motivation was extremely clear,” said Julia Torlet, president and spokesperson for SOS Homophobie – a French NGO that supports victims of anti-LGBTQ attacks.
“We have a helpline and receive many reports of attacks every day,” said Torlet. “But it has become clear that now, a climate of fear has been instilled. People are telling us that they don’t want to leave their homes, that they are scared.”
Blaming a “liberation of homophobic and transphobic speech” inspired by the far right, Torlet said that her organisation has seen a spike in cases of offensive graffiti tags since Macron announced the snap elections on June 9.
And the violence is not only taking place in the streets. Édouard Jouannault-Taylor is head of communications at the Refuge foundation, an organisation tasked with supporting and housing young LGBTQ people in shelters across France who are persecuted by their families. He said that his organisation has seen more “extremist” views become commonplace in recent years, which paves the way for conflict in family settings. “Homophobic and transphobic speech is being liberated. But it goes beyond that, acts are now being liberated too,” he said.
“It is something that we have seen in other European countries. When [far-right leaders] come to power, they don’t always display their homophobia or transphobia outright. But their supporters have no problem in doing so,” said Jouannault-Taylor. “It frees up the energy of all those who oppose LGBTQ rights. That is what we are afraid of.”
Trying to cultivate an LGBTQ-friendly image
Before it was renamed the National Rally, the far-right party was known as the National Front and was founded by Marine Le Pen’s father Jean-Marie Le Pen in 1972. A deeply homophobic figure, Jean-Marie Le Pen once equated AIDS sufferers to “lepers” and described being gay as a “political ideology” – comments for the likes of which he was eventually put on trial in 2018.
Since she took over the party in 2011, Marine Le Pen has tried to soften its racist and homophobic reputation. And though she has even back-pedalled on some of her own pledges, like revoking marriage equality, her political agenda is still a threat to queer rights.
“The National Rally has tried to make itself look more gay-friendly, especially by including gay men in its ranks,” said Torlet. “It’s a way of saying ‘look, there are gays among us, so we are approachable’.”
Le Pen consistently voted against allowing lesbian couples from accessing assisted reproductive techniques, for example, but the law was eventually changed in 2021 to allow lesbian and single women to access the treatment – as well as in vitro fertilisation (IVF).
“And when you look at how the party voted on nine recent laws around LGBTQ rights in the European Parliament, for example, you see that they voted against or abstained eight times out of nine,” Torlet said. “I find that extraordinarily telling.”
As an MEP for the National Rally, Bardella and other members of the party voted against a resolution that condemned Poland for creating zones “free from any LGBTQ ideology” in 2019. They also voted against a declaration designed to make the EU a “freedom zone” for LGBTQ people in 2021. And in 2023, far-right MEPs abstained when an EU vote on the universal decriminalisation of homosexuality was passed.
On the home front, MPs from both the National Rally and the right-wing Les Républicains recently tabled bills that would ban hormone treatment for transgender people under 18. Met with fierce opposition by protestors, the bill was eventually adopted by the Senate on May 29 – but has yet to be put to a final vote in the National Assembly, France’s lower house.
If more far-right and right-wing MPs are voted into parliament after the elections on July 7, the bill has a chance of becoming law.
‘Major consequences’ on rights and safety of LGBTQ community
When it comes to the real dangers LGBTQ people face if the far right comes to power, Torlet explains that “there are two major types of consequences”. The first is legal, and the law on transgender medical treatment for minors is a “concrete example” of a “real threat” to LGBTQ rights.
“If the law passes, [I think] there will be more attacks on the rights of trans people. They will be the first target, that is clear and simple,” said Torlet. “The second target will be same-sex families. We have already seen that happen in neighbouring European countries, like Italy, for example, where [Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni]’s far-right government was quick to crack down on the rights of LGBTQ families.”
Read more‘Ghost parents’: Same-sex couples in Italy are losing their rights
Fear of the far right chiselling away at transgender rights is a sentiment shared by Jouannault-Taylor. “Many of the young people that we house in our shelters are transgender. [If the far-right] comes to power, public policies could be directed against them, against their rights, against their self-determination and their right to realise their full potential,” he said.
The Refuge foundation has also set up a support system for asylum seekers who have had to flee their country because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Given the staunchly anti-immigrant posture of the National Rally, Jouannault-Taylor is worried this demographic “will no longer be able to be accompanied here in France”.
Beyond dismantling the legal rights LGBTQ people in France have fought for, Torlet said the “second major consequence” will be most visible in “people’s daily lives”, especially regarding the violence they may face in the streets.
“If we have a government that adopts uninhibited discriminatory language … in the streets, people will feel it's legitimate to unleash violence with impunity,” she said.
‘A pretty irresponsible sacrifice’
The first round of parliamentary elections will be held in less than two weeks, on June 30, with a final vote set for July 7. Opinion polls have consistently placed the National Rally first but pollsters who have tried to make a second-round forecast for France's 577 constituencies see the party failing to secure the absolute majority needed to be able to pass laws without allies.
Which is exactly why party president Bardella told CNews TV on Tuesday that “in order to act, I need an absolute majority”, and urged voters to rally behind him and Le Pen. He even told France 2 TV on Tuesday that he would turn down the chance to be prime minister should his voters not hand his party an absolute majority.
The National Rally would need to secure 289 seats for an absolute majority. But even if they don’t, Bardella or Le Pen could still become the next prime minister. In France, it is up to the president to elect a prime minister of his or her choosing.
Torlet thinks that “Macron’s decision to dissolve parliament was a way for him to try and discredit the National Rally before the 2027 presidential elections”. She believes his strategy is that “for three years, everyone will see whether or not the RN is fit to rule, and will eventually understand that they should not vote for them.
“Except that minorities will be sacrificed on the altar of this [three-year] test. Three years just to discredit the National Rally is a pretty irresponsible sacrifice.”
And in the run-up to the parliamentary elections, Torlet says that “every word counts” for LGBTQ people.
Visiting the island of Sein off the north-western coast of France on Tuesday, Macron chose to adopt the same language used by his far-right counterparts. Speaking to local residents, he criticised the left’s proposal to allow people to register a gender change by simply going to the town hall as “completely grotesque”. Under current regulations, people must go to court and undergo a cumbersome and stigmatising procedure to register a gender change.
In his 2022 presidential campaign, Macron had proposed to make the lives of transgender people easier by getting rid of unnecessary red tape."

BANGKOK (AP) — Thailand’s landmark marriage equality bill was officially written into law Tuesday, allowing same-sex couples to legally wed.
The law was published in the Royal Gazette after endorsement by King Maha Vajiralongkorn, and will come into effect in 120 days. This means LGBTQ+ couples will be able to register their marriage in January next year, making Thailand the third place in Asia, after Taiwan and Nepal, to allow same-sex marriage.
The bill, which grants full legal, financial and medical rights for marriage partners of any gender, sailed through both the House of Representatives and the Senate in April and June respectively.
“Congratulations to everyone’s love,” Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra wrote on X, adding the hashtag #Love Wins.
Thailand has a reputation for acceptance and inclusivity but struggled for decades to pass a marriage equality law. Thai society largely holds conservative values, and members of the LGBTQ+ community say they face discrimination in everyday life.
The government and state agencies are also historically conservative, and advocates for gender equality had a hard time pushing lawmakers and civil servants to accept change.
Bangkok Deputy Governor Sanon Wangsrangboon said last week that the city officials will be ready to register same-sex marriages as soon as the law gets enacted.
The legislation amended the country’s Civil and Commercial Code to replace gender-specific words such as “men and women” with gender-neutral words such as “individual.”
The government led by the Pheu Thai party has made marriage equality one of its main goals. It made a major effort to identify itself with the annual Bangkok Pride parade in June, in which thousands of people celebrated in one of Bangkok’s busiest commercial districts.
The organizers of Bangkok Pride announced on Facebook that it will organize a wedding for couples who wish to register their marriage on the very first day that the law becomes effective."
3580,fake,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-09-24,"Real data and statistics, that the CDC, WHO, FDA and the Vaccine Industrial Complex do not want anyone to see, have been published and reveal that all the major infectious disease mortality rates were greatly diminishing and on a consistent downward trend BEFORE those vaccines were invented and mass administered.
Several whistleblowers then and now have proof, but a few billion vaccine zealots still won’t be able to wrap their jabbed heads around it. This requires careful consideration and a total rethinking of everything we know about vaccine efficacy, infectious disease rates, and the entire concept of the so-called “holy grail” of medicine.
Take a good look at the graphs of these documented mortality rates in England and Wales from 1838 to 1978, well into the years that these ever-popular vaccinations were invented and mass administered to the populace. We see now, in plain sight, the mass illusion that was perpetrated on the public that vaccines were the saving grace for humankind, and saved billions of injected people from dying from the world’s scariest infectious diseases.
In fact, vaccines and their efficacy were so overblown, that Big Pharma and governments around the world had to make them compulsory so the majority of the populace would comply. In other words, the brainwashing propaganda and faked science wasn’t enough to convince them all.
The graphs even look similar for infectious diseases where there never was a vaccine created. That’s even more “proof in the pudding” that vaccines aren’t helping decrease mortality rates much, if any at all. It was really all about improvements in hygiene, plumbing, sanitation, use of clean water, and hospitals and doctors learning how to disinfect everything, including surgical instruments.
Every human being on earth should be questioning the contribution of vaccinations to the decline of mortality in the world. We already know that nearly all prescription medications only “manage” the symptoms of disease and disorder, rather than address the root cause and actually cure the illnesses. Plus, prescription medications create a host of side effects and adverse events that bring with them new health horrors, only to be addressed with MORE crooked medicine. It’s a vicious cycle and a cash cow for Big Pharma, just like with vaccines.
Pro-vaccine zealots love to scream “science!” when referring to why they believe so wholeheartedly in vaccination, but they should all take a look at the statistics of mortality from that science, based on infectious diseases and the relative vaccines that are supposed to prevent infection, prevent transmission, prevent death. It’s all been a huge farce.
Folks need to look at what really contributed to the decline of mortality over the past century and a half, and they will see it’s really about the rising standards of living. Vaccines may have contributed to this decline of mortality, but only in a miniscule amount compared to the propaganda and disinformation that’s been spread about them, around the globe, for decades. This now includes all the LIES about the safety and efficacy of the Covid mRNA clot shots.

6100,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-10-28,"It is the first time that researchers have been able to accurately estimate premature deaths from gas cooker pollution.
Gas cookers are contributing to the early deaths of around 40,000 Europeans a year, the first scientific study of its kind has concluded.
For almost 50 years, the world has been aware of the dangers of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emitted by gas cookers. Now researchers at the University Jaume I’s School of Health Sciences in Spain have estimated the annual death toll by linking existing health studies to NO2 readings in European homes.
They found that in 14 European countries, hazardous conditions are created inside the average home as the fumes from gas cookers combine with background pollution to break World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines.
“Way back in 1978, we first learned that NO2 pollution is many times greater in kitchens using gas than electric cookers. But only now are we able to put a number on the amount of lives being cut short,” says lead author of the new study, Dr Juana Maria Delgado-Saborit.
“The extent of the problem is far worse than we thought, with our modelling suggesting that the average home across half of Europe breaks WHO limits. Outdoor air pollution lays the foundation for those breaches, but it is gas cookers that push homes into the danger zone.”
Which European countries are most at risk from gas cookers?
Around one-third of European homes cook with gas, and it’s these dwellings that tend to have the highest levels of NO2.
Italy, Poland, Romania, France and the UK suffer the highest share of gas cooker-fuelled premature deaths.
Pollution is worst in homes with poor ventilation and those that spend longer cooking.
Indoor air quality is a serious health issue because Europeans spend almost all of their time inside and buildings get less fresh air as houses are designed to be more airtight.
Gas stoves have also been found to leak methane, a potent greenhouse gas, even when they’re switched off.
As for outside pollution, NASA has recorded significant drops in NO2 pollution over European cities in recent decades thanks to EU vehicle emission rules and vehicle technology. But background pollution remains a major contributor to the hazardous levels found by the new study.
How did the researchers calculate gas cooker pollution deaths?
This study may be a significant breakthrough in our understanding of the human health costs of gas cooking.
Researchers used dozens of health studies that had established likely risk rates of asthma and premature deaths caused by a given level of NO2.
Previous studies could not apply risk rates to the real world until last year, when Dutch researchers took extensive NO2 measurements in and outside homes in multiple European countries to produce the most accurate snapshot yet of indoor pollution from gas cookers.
The university used government datasets to scale up these findings to produce regional maps of indoor NO2 pollution from stoves. These allowed researchers to calculate the first scientific estimates of premature deaths and child asthma cases from NO2 in Europe.
The true human cost of gas cooker pollution is likely significantly higher, however.
A lack of data meant the researchers had to exclude some pollution impacts that may also contribute to higher rates of death and asthma. And they focused only on NO2 pollution because it is well-studied by epidemiologists.
Other harmful pollutants created by burning gas include carbon monoxide, benzene, formaldehyde and particulate matter. The researchers say they lacked the data needed to accurately predict the impact of these pollutants.
Using a less precise method, they estimate that gas cookers cause roughly 367,000 asthma cases in children and 726,000 in all age groups including these other pollutants, excluding carbon monoxide which has no known connection to asthma.
How can we tackle gas cooker pollution?
The EU has no indoor air quality standards and its legislative tools for tackling the problem are patchy, according to the European Public Health Alliance (EPHA).
The bloc is due to propose updated rules for gas cookers later this year and has been considering pollution restrictions - including for NO2.
EPHA is urging Brussels to rapidly phase out gas cookers through emissions limits, alongside introducing financial incentives to switch to cleaner cookers.
“For too long it has been easy to dismiss the dangers of gas cookers,” says EPHA policy manager for global public health Sara Bertucci. “Like cigarettes, people didn’t think much of the health impacts and like cigarettes, gas cookers are a little fire that fills our home with pollution.”
Just as governments helped wean citizens off cigarettes, EPHA argues they should also help us quit gas.
The alliance also wants to see mandatory consumer labels on cookers to signal pollution risks, paired with public education campaigns on the risks of burning fuels indoors."

Healthcare commentator John Campbell, Ph.D. highlighted the trend in a March 21 video, which focused on an exchange in the Houses of Parliament between members of Parliament Andrew Bridgen (who raised the issue) and Mel Stride, who dismissed Bridgen’s concerns.
During the exchange, Bridgen said the number of long-term sick individuals in the U.K. had risen from 2.1 million pre-pandemic to 2.8 million.
Bridgen said “The huge increase started in spring 2021, at the same time as the rollout of the experimental emergency use vaccines,” and then asked “or does the minister have an alternative explanation?”
The Defender reports: Stride, the U.K.’s secretary of state for Work and Pensions, questioned the accuracy of Bridgen’s statement, suggesting that the upward trajectory in long-term sickness numbers predated the vaccination rollout and was related to “mental health issues, muscle and skeletal issues.”
“I certainly do not subscribe to the view that vaccination is in any way unsafe,” Stride said.
Campbell expressed disbelief at how senior politicians could still claim that COVID-19 vaccines are safe. He criticized the “doubling down” on this stance, saying he “can’t imagine what’s going to happen” when the truth about the level of adverse reactions is finally revealed.
Hard to fathom’ anything except vaccines behind increase in long-term illness
Campbell presented data from the U.K. Health Advisory and Recovery Team (HART) to support Bridgen’s claims.
HART is comprised of U.K. “doctors, scientists, economists, psychologists and other academic experts” who came together over shared concerns about pandemic policies.
HART’s graphs, based on the U.K.’s Office for National Statistics data, showed a dramatic increase in the number of people economically inactive due to long-term sickness, starting in February to April 2021 for women and April to June 2021 for men.
Source: Combined graphs from HART based on U.K. Office for National Statistics data.
According to HART, “The timing doesn’t fit long covid,” and is “coincidental with the rollout of the covid vaccines to the working aged population. Other changes in public health that may have caused this rise are hard to fathom.”
Campbell acknowledged that mental health issues and musculoskeletal injuries are common causes of long-term sickness. However, he admitted the timing of the increase suggests a potential correlation with the vaccine rollout.
The HART document also referenced similar findings in U.S. disability trends.
‘Fair to say we have an epidemic of heart failure’
Campbell criticized a decision by the U.K.’s Office for Health Improvements and Disparities (OHID) to stop reporting causes of death in the country for 2024.
He also noted that the Office for National Statistics changed the way it monitors excess deaths, which dramatically reduced the apparent excess deaths throughout 2023 but “made no difference at all … to the amount of people that died and the grieving relatives,” Campbell said.
He noted, however, that under the new system, it “doesn’t look as bad on the government now, presumably.”
Campbell questioned the government’s lack of transparency and the reasons behind not wanting to monitor why people are dying.
He presented data from the OHID showing excess mortality in England across various age groups. The data revealed increased deaths in the 0-24 age group starting in 2021 and continuing through 2022 and 2023, with the vast majority of these deaths in the latter two years being unrelated to COVID-19.
Similar patterns of excess deaths were observed in the 25-49, 50-64, 65-74, 75-84 and 85+ age groups. Campbell expressed frustration at the lack of more detailed age group data, such as separate categories for ages 0-12 and 12-24.
Campbell presented data showing changes in the causes of death in England since 2021. The data revealed notable increases in deaths from ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and heart failure.
“I think it’s fair to say we have an epidemic of heart failure,” he said.
In contrast, deaths from other respiratory diseases decreased, which Campbell found “rather hard to explain.”
While deaths from Alzheimer’s disease were slightly down — likely due to the increased overall mortality — deaths from cirrhosis of the liver showed a “huge increase,” he said.
“It’s a scarred, fibrosed liver with fibrous scar tissue in it, and it’s the end result of any chronic inflammatory disease.”
‘Enough to make you suspicious’
Campbell expressed frustration with the government’s handling of the excess deaths and long-term sickness data.
“From this official government site [OHID], this time next year, we’re not going to know any more than we know at the end of December 2023,” Campbell said.
He also criticized Stride’s response to Bridgen’s questions in Parliament. “Ministers still completely denying there’s any problem, and … getting it wrong, or at least giving very incomplete answers, and it’s enough to make you suspicious.”
Campbell said the evidence presented in the video suggests there are “questions to be answered” and wondered, “How long can the government go on denying this problem?”

5259,real,ANTI_MIGRATION_AND_XENOPHOBIA,2024-10-28,"Since it began at the end of September, Israel’s invasion of Lebanon has heaped more misery onto a Middle East already overwhelmed by humanitarian catastrophe. Within Lebanon, as of 23 October 2024, more than 1.2 million people have fled their homes, and tens of thousands are now trying to flee abroad.
From the European Union (EU)‘s point of view, limited legal migration pathways, together with the presence of already increased migratory pressures, may well create a repeat of the 2015 refugee crisis.
As these migration flows expand, Europe needs to balance immediate humanitarian needs with longer-term issues of refugee resettlement and integration. However, the continent’s current political landscape presents very difficult obstacles to making this happen.
Lebanese refugees fleeing to Syria
After the Arab Spring reached Syria in 2011, Lebanon became home to around 1.5 million Syrian refugees. Today this movement is reversed, as the Israel-Lebanon conflict is pushing both Syrian refugees and Lebanese residents over the border into Syria.
As of 21 October 2024, an estimated 425,000 people had fled Lebanon, crossing the nearest available border into Syria. Additionally, around 16,700 Lebanese residents have sought refuge in Iraq.
Read more: Bouncing between war-torn countries: Displacement in Lebanon and Syria highlights cyclical nature of cross-border refuge
The Israel-Lebanon conflict is still in its early days, and many of these refugees are, for now, going wherever they can. However, they illustrate the volume of forced displacement already underway. In time, many will make their way towards Europe, resulting in greater migratory pressure on the EU, much like the refugee crisis of 2015, when over a million refugees entered Europe mainly – though not exclusively – via Mediterranean routes.
It seems that Europe did not see this coming. Only a few months ago, in May this year, the EU announced a €1 billion aid package for Lebanon in order to confront the migration crisis and tackle it at its root. It is unlikely that this funding will be enough to stabilise the region, or to stem mass migration.
Indeed, Lebanon, already on the verge of political collapse, may soon be unable to coordinate any meaningful migratory controls at all.
In the broader context of an extremely volatile Middle East, this will heap pressure onto Europe. As the region’s instability deepens, European states can expect an additional number of migrants, and their claims for asylum, to reach them via countries like Greece or Italy, both located on the front lines of migration routes.

Could the EU take in all Middle East refugees?
In purely material, economic terms, countries such as Germany have shown that it is possible to absorb huge numbers of refugees.
Back in 2015 more than a million refugees, most of them Syrian, arrived in Germany, and many of them are now contributing to the country’s workforce. Syrians and their families have also helped boost German domestic consumption, and have bolstered an ageing population, demonstrating how migration can be a positive tool when managed effectively.
However, today’s political panorama is different. Surging support for anti-immigration parties has created deeper social divisions over refugee acceptance. Public opinion has shifted toward demanding stricter border controls and reducing intake of migrants.
This ongoing trend has only deepened since the 2024 European Parliament elections, when conservative and far-right parties gained considerable political ground.
The EU’s indecisive response to the crisis is reflected in their weak policy efforts, such as a recent pledge to resettle 31,000 refugees in 2024 and 2025. This is a drop in the ocean – over 16 million refugees and displaced people are currently awaiting resettlement in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).
Whether the EU could take in all refugees from Lebanon and other Middle Eastern conflicts is therefore a complicated question. While on paper it would be economically feasible – and undoubtedly beneficial in the long term – such a move seems politically out of reach. Instead, the EU’s approach to this ongoing crisis will be determined by its unity (or lack thereof) on a common policy.

Future EU migration policy
Germany’s Syrian refugee success story highlights the long-term potential for migration to strengthen the EU’s economy. However, political divisions make such policies politically problematic, as illustrated by Germany itself, which has recently reinstated controls on all of its land borders in an effort to tighten migration controls.
The EU’s newly launched Migration and Asylum Pact suggests measures such as relocation, financial or operational support to member states. This approach aims to meet humanitarian demands, but also allows Member States to safeguard their sovereignty and control.
However, it also calls the coherence of the EU’s own values into question. By, in the Council’s own words, “helping with the deployment of reception centres”, the EU can enable the forced and sometimes unlawful sending of migrants to non-EU countries.
Read more: The EU's outsourced migration control is violent, expensive and ineffective
Such measures also overlook what migration can offer a continent facing demographic headwinds – migrants can bridge gaps in labour markets, promote a culture of innovation, and provide a younger tax base to support ageing populations.
However, to produce such results the newly appointed Commission will not only have to overcome political opposition, but also make sure that the policies it adopts realistically enable proper integration.
How the EU can better manage migration
Several key policy measures can help Europe manage the looming migration crisis.
Expanding legal migration pathways – including resettlement programs, humanitarian visas, and flexible work permits for Lebanese nationals – are key to easing migratory pressures. Additionally, improving conditions for refugees by increasing financial and logistical aid to Lebanon and its neighbours may help to slow migratory flows into Europe.
Enhanced coordination between EU states – as difficult as it seems today – also is necessary to efficiently balance border control with respect for humanitarian principles.
Lastly, while integration programs should draw on successful models such as Germany’s experience with Syrian refugees, the EU also needs to address the root causes of instability through diplomacy and development initiatives. Specifically, this means taking a strong diplomatic stance against Israel, and more generally overcoming the EU’s longstanding weakness and indecision when dealing with its neighbours in the MENA region.
To quote one paper from 2010, the EU has long been “a payer not a player”. However, if this changes, the EU could potentially prevent millions of people from becoming refugees in the first place."
3937,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-07-17,"European Commission didn’t provide enough information about COVID-19 vaccine deals, EU court says
BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Commission did not allow the public enough access to information about COVID-19 vaccine purchase agreements it secured with pharmaceutical companies during the pandemic, the EU general court said Wednesday.
The decision came a day ahead of a vote at the European Parliament at which European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is seeking reelection.
A group of EU lawmakers had taken legal action after the commission refused to grant them complete access to COVID-19 vaccine contracts secured between the EU’s executive arm and manufacturers.
The commission, which can appeal the ruling, said that it generally grants “the widest possible public access” to documents. But in the case of vaccines, it insisted it “needed to strike a difficult balance between the right of the public, including MEPs, to information, and the legal requirements emanating from the COVID-19 contracts themselves, which could result in claims for damages at the cost of taxpayers’ money.”
The pandemic shed light on the issue of transparency surrounding the negotiations for vaccines between the EU and big pharmaceutical groups. The commission was mandated by member countries to organize the joint procurement of vaccines and led negotiations with manufacturers.
According to the court, the procurement of vaccines on behalf of all 27 member states allowed to quickly gather 2.7 billion euros ($2.95 billion) to place an order for more than a billion doses of vaccines.
In 2021, some members of the European Parliament asked for the full details of the agreements, but the commission only agreed to provide partial access to certain contracts and documents, which were placed online in redacted versions. It also refused to say how much it paid for the billions of doses it secured, arguing that contracts were protected for confidentiality reasons.
The court noted that the commission failed to show why divulging the agreements’ provisions on the indemnification of the pharmaceutical companies for any damages they would have to pay in the event of a defect in their vaccines would have actually harmed their commercial interests.
It also said that the commission should have provided information about the member state representatives and commission officials involved in the negotiations.
“The General Court finds that the persons who brought the action had duly demonstrated the specific purpose of the public interest in the disclosure of the personal data of the members of that team,” the court said in a statement. “It was only by having the names, surnames and details of the professional or institutional role of the members of the team in question that they could have ascertained whether or not the members of that team had a conflict of interests.”
The Greens lawmakers, who had started the case, said the ruling should lead the next commission, whose members will be appointed later this year, to be more transparent in its handling of documents’ requests.
“This ruling is significant for the future, as the commission is expected to undertake more joint procurements in areas like health and defense,” said Kim van Sparrentak, one of the lawmakers who filed the lawsuit.
Amid fierce international competition for the access to vaccines, von der Leyen was praised for her leading role during the COVID-19 crisis, when the EU bought doses collectively for its citizens. But she also found herself receiving sharp criticism for the opacity of the negotiations.
Two years ago, the EU’s ombudsman said in a separate case that the commission was responsible for “maladministration” for mishandling a request for access to text messages between its president and the CEO of pharmaceutical company Pfizer regarding COVID-19 vaccine purchases.
Ombudsman Emily O’Reilly recommended that the commission “do a more extensive search for the relevant messages” relating to such purchases, after a story published by the New York Times revealed that von der Leyen and Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla had exchanged text messages and calls about vaccine procurements for EU countries.
A journalist then asked the commission for access to the text messages and other documents, but the executive branch did not provide any texts, saying no record of such messages had been kept. Commission officials had argued that text messages are ephemeral and don’t contain important information to justify their inclusion in a document management system.

2454,real,INSTITUTIONAL_AND_MEDIA_DISTRUST_PUBLIC_INSTITUTIONS,2024-05-24,"Efforts to draft a pandemic treaty falter as countries disagree on how to respond to next emergency
GENEVA (AP) — A global treaty to fight pandemics like COVID is going to have to wait: After more than two years of negotiations, rich and poor countries have failed — for now — to come up with a plan for how the world might respond to the next pandemic.
After COVID-19 triggered once-unthinkable lockdowns, upended economies and killed millions, leaders at the World Health Organization and worldwide vowed to do better in the future. In 2021, member countries asked the U.N. health agency to oversee negotiations to figure out how the world might better share scarce resources and stop future viruses from spreading globally.
On Friday, Roland Driece, co-chair of WHO’s negotiating board for the agreement, acknowledged that countries were unable to come up with a draft. WHO had hoped a final draft treaty could be agreed on at its yearly meeting of health ministers starting Monday in Geneva.
“We are not where we hoped we would be when we started this process,” he said, adding that finalizing an international agreement on how to respond to a pandemic was critical “for the sake of humanity.”
Driece said the World Health Assembly next week would take up lessons from its work and plot the way forward, urging participants to make “the right decisions to take this process forward” to one day reach a pandemic agreement “because we need it.”
The draft treaty had attempted to address the gap that occurred between COVID-19 vaccines in rich and poorer countries, which WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said amounted to “a catastrophic moral failure.”
Addressing a sullen final day of negotiations, the WHO chief insisted, “This is not a failure.”
“We will try everything — believing that anything is possible — and make this happen because the world still needs a pandemic treaty,” he said. “Because many of the challenges that caused a serious impact during COVID-19 still exist.”
The accord’s aim was to set guidelines for how the WHO’s 194 member countries might stop future pandemics and better share resources. But experts warned there were virtually no consequences for countries that don’t comply.
The co-chairs of the treaty-drafting process didn’t specify what caused the logjam, but diplomats have said vast differences remained over sharing of information about pathogens that emerge and the sharing of technologies to fight them.
The latest draft had proposed that WHO should get 20% of the production of pandemic-related products like tests, treatments and vaccines and urges countries to disclose their deals with private companies.
Earlier this month, U.S. Republican senators wrote to the Biden administration, arguing that the draft treaty focused on issues like “shredding intellectual property rights” and “supercharging the WHO.” They urged Biden not to sign off.
Britain’s department of health said it would only agree to an accord if it adhered to British national interest and sovereignty.
Meanwhile, many developing countries said it’s unfair that they might be expected to provide virus samples to help develop vaccines and treatments, but then be unable to afford them.
Precious Matsoso, the other co-chair of WHO’s negotiating board for the pandemic treaty, said there was still an opportunity to reach agreement and that efforts wouldn’t stop — despite the inability to reach a deal on Friday.
“We will make sure that this happens, because when the next pandemic hits, it will not spare us,” she said.
Tedros, the WHO chief, said there should be no regrets.
“What matters now is when do we learn from this and how can we reset things, recalibrate things, identify the main challenges, and then move on,” he said.

3886,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-07-17,"No significant risk of birth defects after pregnant women got COVID vaccine in 1st trimester: Study
Birth defects were not linked to COVID infection in the first trimester either.
Babies born to women who received a COVID-19 vaccine in their first trimester did not have a significant increased risk of birth defects, a new study found.
For the study, published Wednesday evening in the journal The BMJ, researchers used national public health registries in Denmark, Norway and Sweden to compare pregnant women who received either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine in the first trimester and pregnant women who were infected with COVID-19 in the first trimester to women who were not vaccinated or infected.
The team followed more than 343,000 babies born to women with an estimated start of pregnancy between March 1, 2020, and February 14, 2022, with each infant followed for a minimum of nine months.
A total of 10,229, or 3%, of infants had mothers who were infected with COVID-19 during the first trimester. A subgroup of about 152,000 infants, or 19%, had mothers who received a COVID-19 vaccine in the first trimester.
Of the more than 343,000 babies, about 17,700 were diagnosed with a major congenital anomaly within a nine-month follow-up period, but there was no increased risk of any major birth defect for either the infected mothers' group or the vaccinated mothers' group, including heart, brain, eye, face, breathing, limb, kidney, genital and gastrointestinal defects.
All mothers were evaluated by considering factors such as age, smoking during pregnancy, body mass index, socioeconomic status, COVID-19 infection despite vaccination, infant prematurity and other chronic conditions.
The authors also found no increased risk of major birth defects related to fetal deaths that could be attributed to first-trimester COVID-19 infection or vaccination.
Some limitations included excluding mothers from the infected group if they had a positive antigen test followed by a negative PCR test within four days. Additionally, there was no information available on how many doses of vaccines the vaccinated mothers received.
However, the researchers say the findings are a further indication that pregnant people should be vaccinated.
""Vaccination of pregnant women protects the women and the infants from adverse outcomes,"" the authors wrote in the study. ""Furthermore, we did not find any indication that vaccination against COVID-19 during the first trimester increased the risk of anomalies, providing additional evidence about the safety of vaccination in pregnant women. Overall, our findings support the current recommendations to vaccinate pregnant women against COVID-19.""
The study is the latest in a growing body of evidence showing mRNA COVID-19 vaccines -- which Pfizer and Moderna fall under -- are safe to receive before and during pregnancy and do not increase the risks for complications including miscarriage, premature birth, stillbirth or birth defects.
In fact, some research has suggested COVID-19 vaccination can reduce the risk of premature birth and stillbirth, as well as help protect babies younger than 6 months old from being hospitalized due to COVID-19.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends that people who are pregnant, trying to get pregnant now, or who might become pregnant in the future -- as well as who are breastfeeding a baby -- receive an updated COVID-19 vaccine.
People who are pregnant are more likely to become seriously ill and hospitalized if infected with COVID-19, and more likely to suffer pregnancy complications including preterm birth or stillbirth, the CDC said.

“President Biden has committed to making sure that every dollar we have at our disposal will be pushed out the door between now and January 20,” Blinken said, adding that NATO countries must focus their efforts on “ensuring that Ukraine has the money, munitions, and mobilized forces to fight effectively in 2025, or to be able to negotiate a peace from a position of strength.”
Trump has repeatedly questioned Washington's military backing for Kyiv and vowed to rapidly end the war started by Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But he has not said how he will put an end to the conflict, raising concern that he would try to force Ukraine to accept Moscow's terms for peace.
Blinken also said the deployment of North Korean troops to help Russia in the Ukraine war ""demands and will get a firm response."" More than 10,000 North Korean troops are engaged in combat in Russia's Kursk border region, according to the Pentagon.
Asked by RFE/RL if Washington intends to allow Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied long-range modern weapons to strike deeper inside Russia, as requested by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in his recently presented ""victory plan,"" Blinken did not offer a direct answer, saying the United States will continue to ""adapt and adjust"" to Ukraine's needs.
""We're addressing many of the needs that are laid out in the victory plan. That's something that we discussed with allies and partners today,"" Blinken said.
""I am convinced that we will continue to adapt and adjust if necessary,"" he added.
Blinken also met in Brussels with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha, who said Kyiv had maintained contact with both U.S. political parties and had worked with both Trump's team and Biden's.
Sybiha said he would discuss protection of critical infrastructure with Blinken, according to a State Department statement.
""Ukraine's defense cannot be put on hold and wait. Every day Russia is bombing our critical infrastructure -- energy, ports, hospitals, and schools,"" Sybiha said. ""We need better protection for our people already now, not later.""
He added that he was ""confident that we can count on continued U.S. support and further decisive steps.""
Ukraine's whole territory was under an air-raid alert early on November 13 as Moscow launched a sophisticated combination of missiles and drones on Kyiv for the first time in 73 days.
""Putin is launching a missile attack on Kyiv right now,"" Andriy Yermak, Zelenskiy's chief of staff, wrote on Telegram.
Explosions shook Kyiv for hours as Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko urged the Ukrainian capital's residents to take cover.
""More drones are entering the capital. The danger of missiles also persists. Don't leave the shelters!"" Klitschko wrote on Telegram.
The Ukrainian Air Force reported that its air defenses downed two cruise missiles, two ballistic missiles and 37 drones over Kyiv and seven other Ukrainian regions -- Poltava, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Cherkasy, Zaporizhzhya, Chernihiv, and Kirovohrad.

5222,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-08-14,"Fluid keeps your brain from crushing itself and shields your spine from shock – a neurologist explains what happens when it stops working
Cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF, is a clear, colorless liquid that plays a crucial role in maintaining the health and function of your central nervous system. It cushions the brain and spinal cord, provides nutrients and removes waste products.
Despite its importance, problems related to CSF often go unnoticed until something goes wrong.
I am a neurologist and headache specialist. In my work treating patients with CSF pressure disorders, I have seen these conditions present in many different ways. Here’s what happens when your cerebrospinal fluid stops working:
What is cerebrospinal fluid?
CBF is made of water, proteins, sugar, ions and neurotransmitters. It is primarily produced by a network of cells called the choroid plexus, which is located in the brain’s ventricles, or cavities.
The choroid plexus produces approximately 500 milliliters of CSF daily, but only about 150 milliliters are present within the central nervous system at any given time due to constant absorption and replenishment in the brain. This fluid circulates through the ventricles of the brain, the central canal of the spinal cord and the subarachnoid space surrounding the brain and spinal cord.
CSF has several critical functions. It protects the brain and spinal cord from injury by absorbing shocks. Suspending the brain in this fluid reduces its effective weight and prevents it from being crushed under its own mass. Additionally, CSF helps maintain a stable chemical environment in the central nervous system, facilitating the removal of metabolic waste and the distribution of nutrients and hormones.
When the production, circulation or absorption of cerebrospinal fluid is disrupted, this can lead to significant health issues. Two notable conditions are CSF leaks and idiopathic intracranial hypertension.
CSF leak
A CSF leak occurs when the fluid escapes through a tear or hole in the dura mater – the tough, outermost layer of the meninges that surrounds the brain and spinal cord.
The dura can be damaged from head injuries or punctured during surgical procedures involving the sinuses, brain or spine, such as lumbar puncture, epidurals, spinal anesthesia or myelogram. Spontaneous CSF leaks can also occur without any identifiable cause.
CSF leaks were originally thought to be relatively rare, with an estimated annual incidence of 5 per 100,000 people. However, with increased awareness and advances in imaging, health care providers are discovering more and more leaks. They tend to occur more frequently in middle-aged adults and are more common in women than men.
Risk factors for the condition include connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome as well as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.
Unfortunately, it’s common for health care providers to misdiagnose a CSF leak as another condition, like migraine, sinus infections or allergies. What can make diagnosing a CSF leak challenging is its broad symptoms. Most people with CSF leak have a positional headache that improves when lying down and worsens when standing. Pain is usually felt in the back of the head and may involve the neck and between the shoulder blades. In addition to headaches, patients may experience ringing in the ears, vision disturbances, memory problems, brain fog, dizziness and nausea.
Imaging may help guide diagnosis, including an MRI of your brain or entire spine, or a myelogram of the space surrounding your spinal cord. Features of a CSF leak that are visible in a scan include your brain sagging down in the base of your skull as well as a fluid collection outside of your dura. However, an estimated 19% of people with a CSF leak can have normal scans, so not seeing signs of a leak on imaging does not entirely rule it out.
Conservative treatment for a CSF leak involves rest, lying flat and increasing your fluid intake to give your spine time to heal the puncture. Increasing your caffeine consumption to an equivalent of three to four cups of coffee per day can also help by increasing CSF production through stimulating the choroid plexus. Caffeine also relieves pain by interacting with adenosine receptors, which are key players in the body’s pain perception mechanisms.
If a conservative approach is not successful, an epidural blood patch may be necessary. In this procedure, blood is drawn from your arm and injected into your spine. The injected blood can help form a covering over the hole and promote the healing process. Headache improvement can be fast, but if the patch does not work or the results are short-lived, additional testing may be needed to better locate the site of the leak. In rare cases, surgery may be recommended. Most patients with CSF leak respond to some form of these treatments.
Idiopathic intracranial hypertension
Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a disorder involving an excess of CSF that elevates pressure inside the skull and compresses the brain. The term “idiopathic” indicates that the cause of the raised pressure is unknown.
Most patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension have a history of obesity or recent weight gain. Other risk factors include taking certain medications such as tetracycline, excessive vitamin A, tretinoin, steroids and growth hormone. Middle-aged obese women are 20 times more likely to be diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension than other patient groups. As obesity becomes more prevalent, so too does the incidence of this condition.
Patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension typically experience headaches and vision changes, tinnitus or eye pain. Papilledema, or swelling of the optic disc, is the hallmark finding on a fundoscopic examination of the back of the eye. Clinicians may also observe paralysis of the patient’s eye muscles.
Brain imaging of patients suspected of having idiopathic intracranial hypertension is crucial to excluding other causes of elevated CSF pressure, such as brain tumors or blood clots in the brain. A lumbar puncture or spinal tap to measure the pressure and composition of CSF is also central to diagnosis.
Since high intracranial pressure can damage the optic nerve and lead to permanent vision loss, the primary goal of treatment is to decrease pressure and preserve the optic nerve. Treatment options include weight loss, dietary changes and medications to reduce CSF production. Surgical procedures can also reduce intracranial pressure.
Future directions and unknowns
Cerebrospinal fluid is indispensable for brain health. Despite advancements in understanding diseases related to CSF, several aspects remain unclear.
The exact mechanisms that lead to conditions like CSF leaks and idiopathic intracranial hypertension are not fully understood, though there are many theories. Further research is vital to enhance diagnostic accuracy and effective treatments for CSF disorders."

In his application, the man stated that the club, tentatively called ‘Lorenzo Gay Club’, was to be a “great convenience and resource for many homosexual, bisexual and even some heterosexual people residing in Abbottabad in particular, and in other parts of the country in general,” The Telegraph reported.
Gay sex is illegal in Pakistan, and it can lead to up to two years in prison. While these laws are rarely applied, the conservative religious culture in Pakistan has made it difficult to be openly homosexual, the outlet revealed.
The application further said that in the envisaged gay club, “there would be no gay (or non-gay) sex (other than kissing).” A notice on the wall would warn against “sex on premises,” the application mentioned.
“This would mean that no legal constraints (even obsolete ones like [anti-sodomy] PPC section 377) would be flouted on the premises,” it added.
Before being sent to the mental hospital in Peshawar, the man told the news outlet, “I talk about human rights and I want everyone’s human rights to be defended”.

According to the website of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), Pakistan still criminalizes homosexual acts through Section 377 of its national penal code.
“Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less than two years nor more than ten years, and shall also be liable to a fine,” the law reads.
The OHCHR document states that Pakistan’s provisions against homosexual acts “have been found to constitute a clear violation of international human rights law.”
According to Human Dignity Trust, a non-profit based in London, only gay men are criminalized under the Pakistan Penal Code.
“There is some evidence of the law being enforced in recent years, with LGBT people occasionally being subject to arrest,” the non-profit’s website reads. “There have been consistent reports of discrimination and violence being committed against LGBT people in recent years, including murder, rape, assault, and the denial of basic rights and services.”"

""As a result of the first strike, one person died and several floors of the hospital were destroyed,"" Klymenko said on Telegram, adding that while rescuers were evacuating the patients and staff, Russia launched a second strike.
Klymenko said it was the second day in a row that Ukrainian police lost personnel. ""In Kryviy Rih, the search continues at the site of yesterday's attack on a police building. According to available information, one more employee may be under the rubble,"" he said.
Earlier, Ukraine's air force said its air defenses shot down 69 of 73 drones launched by Russia at Ukrainian regions early on September 28.
Russia also fired two ballistic and two cruise missiles at targets inside Ukraine, the air force said, adding that the two cruise missiles were downed.

""As a result, a nonresidential building was damaged. No information on casualties was received,"" the administration said in a message on Telegram.
The latest round of Russian attacks came a day after Zelenskiy met with Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump amid tensions over what critics call the ex-president's pro-Russian stance.
Zelenskiy, in a Fox News interview broadcast on September 28, said he received ""very direct information"" from Trump that if he won the November presidential election, he would support Kyiv in its war with Russia.
""I don't know what will be after elections and who will be the president...But I've got from Donald Trump very direct information that he will be on our side, that he will support Ukraine,"" Zelenskiy said.
Zelenskiy, who also met with Trump's November rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, and current President Joe Biden during his U.S. trip, said, ""I don't want to be involved to the election period.... I don't want to lose one or another part of Americans.""
Following his meeting with the Ukrainian leader, Trump repeated his claim that he would be able to rapidly end the war.

Prior to the meeting, U.S. media had speculated the session might not take place after Trump took offense to Zelenskiy's comments in a magazine interview that stated Trump ""doesn't really know how to stop the war.""
Zelenskiy presented Biden and Harris his ""victory plan,"" a strategy to end the war about which little detail is known.

3832,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-08-30,"Queer communities have welcomed plans to count them in the census but are calling for their gender-diverse peers to be included.
The 2026 census will be the first national snapshot to have a question on sexuality after Labor backflipped on a decision to scrap a plan to collect the data.
Sex Discrimination Commissioner Anna Cody said the decision recognised all Australians deserved to be counted.
“To make good policies, for the government to do its job properly, it needs to have the right data,” she told reporters in Sydney on Friday.
“It needs to have the evidence on which to base the decisions that it makes.”
This included the government’s 10-year LGBTQI health and wellbeing plan, which would be “ineffective if we don’t include everybody”, Dr Cody said.
“The national census, it’s all of Australia … so that includes LGBTQI+ communities,” she said.
Equality Australia CEO Anna Brown welcomed the decision to add sexuality but said the government should not pick and choose who was counted.
She said a question asking what someone’s current gender was on top of what sex they were assigned at birth would capture how many trans people were in Australia.
“One in two transgender young people attempt suicide,” she said.
“This is a really vulnerable community – the government should be doing everything it can to capture data about trans and gender-diverse people in this country.”
Labor pledged to “discontinue the practice of randomly assigning non-binary people and intersex people as male or female” in the census in its 2023 national policy platform.
Demographer Liz Allen branded Labor’s initial push to stop the question from being included as an unprecedented moment in the interference of an independent statutory authority.
Letting the Australian Bureau of Statistics work independently would have avoided prolonged scrutiny over something that really is just a mundane statistical collection that understands the family photograph of Australia, she said.
Dr Allen said Labor’s explanation to scrap the question was “unclear and incomplete” after senior ministers said it was made to avoid a divisive and harmful debate.
“The idea that we were trying to avoid division, that’s exactly what we have got – perhaps in a more harmful way because now it has been brought to light,” she told ABC TV on Friday.
Ms Brown criticised any suggestion data collection was divisive.
“Frankly, it’s absurd and offensive to suggest that LGBTQI people’s existence is somehow a threat to our society,” she said.
“We were quite staggered by those comments.”
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese used the annual LGBTQI awareness day Wear It Purple to announce that “one question about sexuality, sexual preference” would be included in the 2026 survey.
Respondents have the option not to answer the question.
He said it was “a common-sense outcome” that reflected society’s changed values.
“In 2024 or 2026, the world has changed … people’s sexuality wasn’t as open or as accepted as it is today,” he said.
Liberal MP Bridget Archer said it was frustrating Labor had created controversy where there was none.
“I don’t think anybody was thinking about it, talking about it, concerned about it until the government told them they should be concerned in some way by deciding not to go ahead with it,” she said.
Opposition Leader Peter Dutton chastised the prime minister’s changing position after a handful of Labor backbenchers broke ranks with the leadership and publicly called for the question to be included.
“He tells different audiences different things … the PM is all over the shop at a time when we need certainty,” he told reporters in Tasmania.
Asked whether the question should be included, Mr Dutton said “I’m fine with that if the prime minister’s got a proposal”.
He said the government had not approached the opposition regarding any potential legislation.
Mr Dutton previously said he was happy to leave the current set of questions and claimed adding sexuality was part of “a woke agenda”.

6045,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-10-11,"Convincing countries to give more money to tackle climate change will be the centrepiece of the climate summit.
The next UN climate conference, COP29, is taking place a month today in Azerbaijan’s capital of Baku.
In a week marred by deadly flooding in eastern Europe and a “berserk” climate fuelled hurricane in the US, it is painfully evident that the climate crisis continues to escalate beyond our efforts to temper it.
For a fortnight from 11 to 22 November, the world will be looking to leaders to ramp up climate action and afford stronger protection to those on the frontlines.
COP29 is billed as the ‘finance COP’, because it is time for countries to set a new global climate finance goal. Ahead of COP30 in Brazil next year, they also need to submit stronger national climate commitments.
And after some wins at COP28 in Dubai last year - including the official launching of a new loss and damage fund for climate victims - developing countries are anxious for past commitments to be honoured and improved on.
A month is a long time in global affairs. Devastating conflict in the Middle East, and the US election in early November, will influence the negotiations in various ways. But given the timeframes built into the UNFCCC process, here are the key issues heading into the summit.
What was agreed at COP28?
As required by the Paris Agreement which has guided global climate action since 2015, the main outcome agreed at COP28 was the first ever ‘global stocktake’.
For the first time at a climate COP, the final text actually named fossil fuels - and called for all countries to “transition away” from them. Despite this progress, the decision shied away from the full “phase-out” many said was needed to stay below 1.5C global heating.
The outcome also called on countries to contribute to the global tripling of renewable energy capacity by 2030.
Following the historic agreement to create a loss and damage fund at COP27 - to effectively compensate climate-vulnerable countries - COP28 succeeded in officially launching the fund.
The finer details remain to be figured out in Baku, before the money actually starts flowing to nations in need next year.
Why is COP29 being called the ‘finance COP’?
For the first time in 15 years, countries will need to agree to a new global finance goal, known as the new collective quantified climate finance goal (NCQG).
This will update the target set in 2009, when developed countries pledged to mobilise $100 billion (€91.4 bn) a year by 2020 to help developing countries mitigate and adapt to climate change. A promise they only managed to deliver on in 2022.
With the crisis intensifying, the actual amount of climate finance that developing countries now need is estimated to be in the region of $500 billion dollars to over $1 trillion a year. There are big challenges to bridging the minimum that they will be willing to accept in a deal, and the maximum that developed countries are willing to put themselves on the hook for.
As well as the total figure, COP29 will see much wrangling over the terms of the NCQG, including: who the donor base and recipients will be; how much will come from public and private sources; and whether it will be in the form of grants or loans.
Where does the EU stand on climate finance?
EU ministers approved their conclusions on climate finance earlier this week, committing to continue to collectively mobilising $100 billion per year until 2025, and to set an “ambitious” NCQG for thereafter.
The council is expected to adopt its final negotiating mandate for COP29 on 15 October. Currently, the climate finance text stresses that international public finance should be at its core and be provided by a “broader base of contributors, including those countries that are capable of contributing.”
Michael Bloss, climate and industrial policy spokesperson for the Greens in the European Parliament, tells Euronews Green that “$100 billion per year is nowhere near enough.”
“Our priority is clear: balance funding across mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage, with strict interim targets,” he adds. “Grants must replace loans to break the cycle of debt and unlock true potential for sustainable development.”
It remains to be seen whether the NGQG will have specific sub-goals for adaptation and loss and damage funding. The former is more likely, according to Alden Meyer, a senior associate at the E3G climate think tank. For the last few years, developing countries have been fighting for 50 per cent of finance to be allocated towards adaptation - given the urgent need to adjust to climate change.
Laying the ground for stronger NDCs
Also fast approaching under the Paris Agreement is the deadline for countries to submit new Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), outlining how they will curb emissions.
These must be renewed every five years, with the next round due in February 2025. So COP29 is a crucial moment for countries to raise the bar and hold each other to account.
NDCs should include sector-specific targets, such as concrete goals for shifting to emissions-free energy and food systems, the World Resources Institute (WRI) notes.
During a recent high-level event, the troika of presidencies - the UAE, Azerbaijan and COP30 host Brazil - indicated that their NDCs will either be announced at COP or by the end of the year.
But despite some stirring rhetoric on “keeping 1.5C alive”, Meyer said the leaders had little information on how they will act on last year’s global stocktake.
“I was struck by the fact that the troika presidencies said nothing about reforming their current intentions to expand production and export of fossil fuels,” he told press during a subsequent briefing. “All three of them have plans to dramatically scale up investment in that sector.”
COP29 has the mammoth task of bringing rhetoric closer to reality.
Turning energy ambition into action
“This is going to be a finance COP that we’re heading into,” said Leo Roberts, an energy transition expert at E3G during the same briefing. “But that doesn’t mean that energy is no longer relevant - in fact it makes it extremely important that it’s not dropped.”
With the global stocktake decision, COP28 concluded with a set of global efforts that countries were called on to contribute to, including: tripling renewable energy capacity and doubling energy efficiency by 2030; phasing-down coal power; and transitioning away from fossil fuels.
“It’s quite clearly a package, not a menu,” said Roberts, flagging a worrying selectiveness around the fossil fuel side of the equation. He also noted a lack of coherence about how countries are linking ambition on the global energy transition to financing.
In his first official letter to parties, COP29 President-Designate Mukhtar Babayev emphasised that the summit’s two pillars will be enhancing ambition and enabling action.
The latest IEA report finds that the world is currently only on track for increasing renewable energy capacity by 2.7 times by 2030, so more action and financial support is needed on this front.
Who is going to COP29?
World leaders will be arriving at Baku Stadium for the World Leaders Climate Action summit at the start of COP on 12 and 13 November.
As in previous years, this will be a chance for heads of state to convene before their negotiators get down to business. The biggest names tend to be confirmed nearer the time.
But in a sign that the event will be slimmer than the record-breaking list of over 65,000 attendees last year, numerous finance bosses have said they plan to skip the summit this year.
Despite the focus on private finance, the heads of Bank of America, BlackRock, Standard Chartered and Deutsche Bank are not attending, the Financial Times reports, with some arguing this is a “technical COP” less suited to business.
The UK’s veteran climate attender King Charles is also reportedly giving COP29 a miss.
But Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev is sure to be welcoming many more world leaders including Barbadian prime minister Mia Mottley, a champion of more equitable climate action. Now head of the V20 group of climate-vulnerable countries, Mottley will be bringing more radical ideas for financial reform under the Bridgetown Initiative.
Civil society organisations and climate campaigners will be travelling to Azerbaijan too - another petrostate host that has drawn scrutiny for its human rights record.
“Climate action must be holistic, with justice at its core,” adds EU Greens spokesman Bloss. “This includes holding COP host Azerbaijan accountable for its precarious human rights situation and demanding full freedom for civil society and national climate activists to act without restraint.

6177,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-05-07,"Many medical organizations have been recommending lung cancer screening for decades for those at high risk of developing the disease.
But in 2022, less than 6% of people in the U.S. eligible for screening actually got screened. Compared with other common cancer screenings, lung cancer screening rates fall terribly behind. For comparison, the screening rate in 2021 for colon cancer was 72%, and the rate for breast cancer was 76%. Why are lung cancer screening rates so poor?
I am a pulmonologist who specializes in screening and diagnosing lung cancer. In my research to improve early detection of lung cancer, I’ve found that numerous complex barriers hinder the widespread adoption of lung cancer screening.
Basics of lung cancer screening
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. But early detection can significantly improve outcomes.
Survival rates for early stage lung cancer are nearly seven times higher than lung cancer that has spread in the body. Between 2015 and 2019, survival rates for lung cancer have improved by 22%, in part because of an increase in earlier diagnosis.
Most patients with early-stage lung cancer, however, have no symptoms and aren’t diagnosed until they reach more advanced stages that are harder to treat, underlining the need for effective lung cancer screening.
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends lung cancer screening for people 50-80 years old, people who currently smoke or previously smoked but quit within the past 15 years, and people who smoked at least 20 pack-years. Pack-years is an estimate of cigarette exposure in a person’s lifetime, calculated by multiplying the total number of years someone has smoked by the average number of packs smoked per day. For example, if someone smoked half a pack per day for 40 years, they would have smoked for 20 pack-years.
Low-dose CT scan for lung cancer
One of the primary barriers to lung cancer screening is lack of public awareness and understanding. Many people are unaware they qualify for lung cancer screening or have misconceptions around what to expect from the screening process.
Lung cancer screening involves a yearly low-dose computed tomography, or CT, scan, a diagnostic imaging tool that uses X-rays to create detailed cross sections of the inside of the body. Screening 250 patients can prevent one lung cancer death. In comparison, 645 people screened with a mammogram can prevent one breast cancer death.
Some people have reservations surrounding the scan itself because of radiation exposure. The radiation from a low-dose CT scan, however, is about 1.4 millisieverts – the scientific unit used to measure ionizing radiation – which is less than the 3 to 5 millisieverts of background radiation a person may be exposed to in a given year on average while living on Earth.
The whole process takes only a few minutes and does not require any needles, medications or infusions. During the scan, the patient lies on the scanner’s sliding table and raises their arms above their head. The technologist may ask them to hold their breath for 5 to 10 seconds as the table passes through the scanner.
A radiologist summarizes the results of the test for their doctor in a report. If the result is negative for findings in the lungs, the patient would return in one year for another scan. If the result is positive, it usually means the radiologist saw a lung nodule, or a spot on the lung. Not all lung nodules are cancer, and patients may require additional imaging or a biopsy to confirm.
Disparities in lung cancer screening
Public health campaigns and education initiatives work to engage the public and increase awareness of the availability and benefit of lung cancer screening. However, these efforts have been less effective in some of the communities most at risk for developing lung cancer.
African American men have the highest rates of developing and dying from lung cancer compared with other groups, even at younger ages and among those with less smoking history. The tobacco industry has explicitly targeted the Black community with pervasive marketing tactics in predominantly Black neighborhoods and stores. Since the 1970s, the tobacco industry has aggressively marketed menthol cigarettes to African Americans using tailored messaging and imagery. This compounds and exacerbates the socioeconomic disparities in health care and cancer care already seen in these underserved and underrepresented communities.
Rural communities face geographic barriers to lung cancer screening. About 80.5 million Americans live in counties with high rates of lung cancer and poor access to a quality screening center. Many of these counties are clustered in the Appalachian and southeastern regions of the U.S. where smoking rates are highest. Over 60% of people living in rural areas who are eligible for lung cancer screening have to travel over 20 miles to a screening facility.
Lung cancer screening may also be costly. While most private insurances and Medicare cover the cost of lung cancer screening, Medicaid policies vary state by state and may not cover the cost of lung cancer screening. In addition, while some plans may cover the initial low-dose CT scan, they might not cover follow-up testing, procedures and treatment. Supplementary costs such as transportation, time off from work, child care and other logistical issues can also add up to create additional socioeconomic barriers to screening.
Communities that are under- or uninsured are at the highest risk of developing lung cancer. They often lack access to primary care providers, let alone specialists who can facilitate screening.
Erasing smoking stigma
Because lung cancer is linked to smoking, stigma plays a significant role in preventing many people eligible for screening from pursuing it. Many people eligible for lung cancer screening fear being blamed for their previous or current tobacco use.
Stigma also discourages patients from discussing lung cancer screening with their health care providers or community. Clinicians can partner with patients and communities to destigmatize lung cancer and tobacco dependence, extricating the disease from blame. Framing screening as a proactive measure to help those at risk of developing lung cancer and as a collaboration with those who need help quitting smoking can empower people to actively engage in screening rather than dreading or avoiding it.
Fear is another barrier. Many people believe that a lung cancer diagnosis is a death sentence. When diagnosed early, however, doctors treat lung cancer with an intention to cure. Additionally, advances in lung cancer treatment over the past 10-15 years have led to remarkable improvements in survival for all stages of the disease. Reassurance and education around next steps and paths to treatment at the time of screening help diffuse some of the distress surrounding lung cancer.
Public health researchers are exploring how to minimize the significant and complex barriers to lung cancer screening for those who need it most."
5675,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-10-22,"The European Parliament has approved a loan of up to 35 billion euros ($38 billion) for Ukraine's defense and reconstruction that will be repaid using future revenues from Russian central bank assets frozen abroad.
RFE/RL's Ukraine Live Briefing gives you the latest developments on Russia's invasion, Western military aid, the plight of civilians, and territorial control maps. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.
The loan accounts for the EU's share of a larger plan devised by the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrialized countries to lend Ukraine $50 billion.
It comes as Kyiv's forces face a fierce Russian offensive in the east and frequent deadly strikes on cities and energy infrastructure, which claimed seven lives, including three children, on October 22.
The plan, officially known as the G7's Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) Loans to Ukraine, was announced by the Group of Seven in June.
EU lawmakers on October 22 voted 518-56 with 61 abstentions in favor after the bloc's governments approved the measure earlier this month. Most of the blocked Russian assets are located in the EU.
The loan is to be serviced by revenues generated by Russian sovereign assets frozen in the West after the start of Moscow's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
""Since the first day of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's war, it has been clear: One day, Russia must pay for the destruction of Ukrainian society and the rebuilding of a future Ukraine,"" said Karin Karlsbro, the European Parliament's rapporteur on EU financial assistance to Ukraine.
""But already today, the European Parliament can make it happen. By using the windfall profits of the frozen Russian assets, we can send 45 billion euros to Ukraine and let Russia pay.""
Russia has protested the use of its frozen assets, estimated at some $300 billion, calling it illegal and threatening retaliation.
""The loan is not expected to rest on the one who was attacked, but it is paid back by the aggressor,"" said EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders.
As part of the same plan, Britain announced earlier on October 22 that it will provide Ukraine with a £2.26 billion ($2.4 billion) loan to acquire more weapons systems.
U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey and Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves announced the loan while visiting Ukrainian troops training in Britain, the London government said in a statement.
The loan is ""earmarked as budgetary support for Ukraine’s military spending, enabling the Ukrainians to invest in key equipment to support their efforts against Russia, such as air defense, artillery, and wider equipment support,"" the statement said.
""Our support for Ukraine and her men and women in their fight for freedom from [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s aggression is unwavering and will remain so for as long as it takes,"" it said.
The loan is in addition to Britain's existing $3.9 billion annual military-aid program for Ukraine and comes on top of the $16 billion already committed by London in military, economic, and humanitarian support for Kyiv.
Meanwhile, three people, including a young girl, were killed in the northeastern Sumy region, which borders Russia, the region's administration said, while in the eastern Donetsk region two children and a 64-year-old woman died in Russian strikes over the past 24 hours, according to local officials.
A 13-year-old girl died in Odesa during a school evacuation prompted by an air-raid alarm, police said.
The Ukrainian Air Force said it shot down 42 of the 60 drones launched by Russia at eight regions -- Sumy, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhya, Kyiv, Kherson, and Kharkiv.
In Russia, authorities in two regions reported that Ukrainian drones targeted three alcohol distilleries.
In the Tambov region, southeast of Moscow, a drone strike sparked a fire at the Biokhim ethanol distillery, regional Governor Maksim Yegorov said on Telegram. Biokhim is one of Russia's oldest manufacturers of ""products of strategic importance for the state,"" mainly ethanol, the company says on its website.
In the Tula region, south of Moscow, Ukrainian drones struck alcohol distilleries, one in Efremov, and one in Luzhkovsky, regional Governor Dmitry Milyaev said, adding that there were no casualties.
Russia's Defense Ministry said its air defense systems shot down 18 Ukrainian drones overnight.
Ukraine, whose civilian and energy infrastructure has been pummeled relentlessly by Russian attacks, has in recent months been increasingly targeting Russian oil and fuel depots and other facilities working for the military."

At Casa Lleca, an LGBTQ+ shelter in Mexico City, a community kitchen has emerged to provide employment opportunities to transgender women and serve residents in the area.
MEXICO CITY (AP) — Karolina Long Tain González Rodríguez plops another corn cake into the piping hot oil of a large pan. As she grabs a set of tongs to flip them one by one, she yells across the kitchen realizing she’s pressed for time.
“We open in 15 minutes!” she shouts over the cumbia music playing in the background.
At Casa Lleca, an LGBTQ+ shelter in Mexico City’s Peralvillo neighborhood, a community kitchen was founded two months ago to provide employment opportunities to transgender women — and serve surrounding residents in the area.
As González, 36, reaches over for more of the corn cakes to fry, Thalia Trejo busies herself stuffing shredded pork into small masses of dough. While they’ve only worked together for a short time, González says she runs a kitchen based on mutual respect and communication.
“We know how to talk to each other… and we know how to find a solution. We’re a really united trans community, we’re really understanding,” she said.
(AP Video/Martín Silva)
The community kitchen was born after Casa Lleca received approval from city authorities to open through a social welfare program, as many trans women in the shelter were having trouble finding work.
Casa Lleca’s founder and human rights activist Victoria Sámano, 30, had brought up the idea to González, who came from a culinary background.
“She (Victoria) saw the opportunity to employ our friends who arrived unhoused and gave them dignified work,” González said.
Much of the funding for the kitchen came from the women themselves, who purchased appliances, chairs and tables to create an authentic dining experience.
González, a native of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca, arrived at Casa Lleca seven months ago seeking refuge and a fresh start as a trans woman. She had studied cooking in middle and high school, but then dropped out, and after working in a kitchen in Oaxaca, she left for Mexico City to begin her transition.
Once in the capital, she was recommended to a plastic surgeon who gave her faulty breast implants and, after one of them ruptured, he refused to give her a warranty — or operate her again.
That’s when she said her life began to spiral.
“I acquired lots of bad vices, lots of bad habits, and that took me to a lot of dark places,” she recalled. “But God always has a plan for us.”
When she arrived at Casa Lleca, things began to turn around.
Sámano approached her after noticing her active involvement in the shelter and strong work ethic. She thought González could be a good fit to lead the kitchen. Along with her other helpers, González runs a tight crew. All kitchen employees are up by 7 a.m. to bathe and drink coffee. They start cooking at 8:30 a.m. and prepare for customers’ arrival at 1 p.m.
For González, the kitchen has become a safe space where she can also use all of her culinary knowledge. “Now that I found this kitchen, this project and this rhythm of life, I’ve found a way to fulfill my dreams as a young person,” she said.
Though the kitchen initially began as an idea to serve and employ their community, as soon as it opened, residents in the surrounding neighborhood started to flock in. Out in front of Casa Lleca, Sámano guides customers into the small dining room set up for the community kitchen. Etched onto a whiteboard hung on a steel door, the menu reads in big black letters, “chicharrón gorditas, soup, beans and dessert.” A full meal for only 11 pesos (about 50 cents).
They cook lunch for up to 150 people a day, including workers like 31-year-old Alan Olivares, who has become a regular. Olivares, a cleaner who works in the nearby Cuauhtemoc neighborhood, has been eating at the kitchen for the past couple of weeks.
“In addition to saving some money, the food is delicious,” he said, adding that he was happy to see the shelter thriving in its new business. “Mexico needs to have a more open mind, we’re all human and it’s part of our diversity,” he said.
Sámano founded Casa Lleca in 2020, right in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, in an effort to help LGBTQ+ folks and sex workers who were unhoused or at risk of losing their homes. As hotels remained shut down, many had been left without a home or workplace. She said many of the shelters that were opened by the government at that time didn’t know how to address the needs of the LGBTQ+ community.
“When they arrive in these spaces, they are often violated or discriminated against,” said Sámano. “In part by other residents, but (also) by the staff who don’t know where to place them because of their gender identity.”
“One day, when we leave this place, we’re going to say ‘thank you, Casa Lleca’ for showing me how to live,” said González. “Thank you for showing me new progress in my life.”
Still, many trans individuals like González are not given the space and support to embrace who they are, and are often vulnerable to dangerous situations.
Mexico’s trans community continues to face challenges, and transgender individuals continue to be killed, sparking protests and anger. So far this year, 36 trans people have been killed in Mexico, according to an August report from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.
Some progress has been made. At least 20 Mexican states have passed legislation to protect trans people. Mexico City in July passed the Paola Buenrostro law, named after a trans woman and sex worker killed in 2016, making transfemicides a crime punished by a prison sentence of up to 70 years.
Sámano believes adopting laws to support trans individuals is crucial. She points at laws passed recently in Spain and Colombia that cover everything, from access to medical services to labor protections for trans people.
“(These laws) address many areas of life for a trans person, and put emphasis on the tools for them to overcome and — in some cases — to survive,” said Sámano.
For residents of Casa Lleca, the community kitchen has also helped to raise awareness about who they are and what role they play in the neighborhood.
“Now that they’ve tried the food, and they saw we opened the kitchen with a really nice atmosphere, people started to approach us,” said González. “How should I refer to you all? They ask… ‘We’re trans women,’ I would tell them. People have been really accepting.”

Anyone who got Covid vaccinated could be catapulting cancer, IBS, autism, dementia and catching Covid or the next pandemic of Bird Flu, Monkeypox, or whatever other gain-of-function lab-made virus Big Pharma releases into the wild.
Gastroenterologist Dr. Sabine Hazan tested the microbiomes of doctors who volunteered to be tested BEFORE and AFTER getting Covid vaccinated with spike protein prion creating mRNA jabs and discovered that their most important gut bacteria were wiped out within 30 days to almost non-existent. What’s worse is that bifidobacteria remained decimated for 60 days, 90 days, even up to six months.
She then tested newborn babies, whose mothers were injected before their birth with Covid jabs, and the babies had ZERO bifidobacteria (good gut flora) microbes after 90 days and they stayed at zero nine months later. Let that sink in. These newborns have next-to-zero immunity during their first year of life due to the Covid vaccine.
Dr. Hazan had applied for grants and loans to do this research, but of course, no way was Big Pharma, the FDA or the CDC going to help her do this kind of research that exposes the vaccine industry and Covid jabs for what they really are – biological weapons of mass destruction and genocide.
The problem is compounded for people who contracted Covid, which means the virus and the mRNA jabs both destroy vital and beneficial gut bacteria. Dr. Hazan said, “I kept collecting stool samples of patients and noticed that patients with severe covid had a certain bacteria that was missing compared to people that were highly exposed to covid, but never got covid. That bacteria is called bifidobacteria. Bifidobacteria is an important and key microbe for immunity. It represents your trillion-dollar industry of probiotics.”
Dr. Hazan also explained the mystery of why babies and young children were not catching Covid, and if they did, they were not at risk of getting a severe case of it or dying. She said that bifidobacteria is present in newborns, but it’s absent in elderly people as just part of the process of ageing. See where this is heading? Covid and the jabs are part of the population reduction agenda of the globalists who funded gain-of-function and instructed scientists to create “vaccines” that did further damage to the biological seat of immunity for all humans infected and/or injected.
It took Dr. Hazan eight months to publish this research paper entitled ‘The lost microbes of Covid-19’. She also wrote about how vitamin C increases bifidobacteria. In conclusion, the loss of bifidobacteria is a catapult for humans contracting, developing and suffering from a whole host of diseases and disorders, most of which would be prevented by simply boosting good gut bacteria with probiotics, eating clean healthy food, and avoiding the deadly Covid jabs at all costs.

4583,real,ANTI_MIGRATION_AND_XENOPHOBIA,2024-10-07,"In an interview on “The Hugh Hewitt Show” that aired Monday morning, former President Donald Trump criticized Vice President Kamala Harris for her policies on the southern border and suggested that migrants have “bad genes.”
“When you look at the things that she proposes, they’re so far off she has no clue. How about allowing people to come to an open border, 13,000 of which were murderers,” he said, referring to the vice president’s immigration proposals.
“Many of them murdered far more than one person, and they’re now happily living in the United States,” he added. “You know, now a murderer, I believe this, it’s in their genes. And we got a lot of bad genes in our country right now. They left, they had 425,000 people come into our country that shouldn’t be here, that are criminals.”
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre slammed Trump for his “hateful speech,” saying President Joe Biden and Harris would “continue to forcefully reject” this kind of rhetoric.
“That type of language is hateful, it’s disgusting, it’s inappropriate and has no place in our country,” Jean-Pierre said at Monday's press briefing. “This comes from the same vile statements that we’ve had, that we’ve heard about migrants being poison, poisoning the blood — that’s disgusting.”
Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said earlier Monday that the former president ""was clearly talking about MURDERERS — not migrants.""
The 13,000 figure Trump cited is misleading. Immigration and Customs Enforcement told Congress in September that there are 13,000 immigrants convicted of homicide living outside of ICE detention, but three law enforcement officials told NBC News that that figure doesn't include people who were detained outside of ICE enforcement because ICE doesn't keep track of incarcerations on the state or local level. Two law enforcement officials also told NBC News that many of them crossed the border before Biden was president (including during Trump's tenure).
Border crossings across the country have dropped this year, in part due to Biden administration policies and in part to Mexico's efforts (which followed pressure on the Mexican government from the Biden administration).
During a rally last month, Trump argued that Harris should be “impeached and prosecuted,” suggesting that her border policies have led to people being murdered by migrants who crossed the border. Trump and his allies have sought to blame Harris for millions of border crossings by migrants after Biden in 2021 deputized her to address the root causes of migration from Central America.
Trump has long invoked disparaging rhetoric when discussing immigration. He launched his 2016 presidential campaign by complaining about Mexico “not sending the best” people. His comments have ramped up since then, accusing immigrants of ""poisoning the blood of our country,"" a phrase that the Biden campaign likened to the rhetoric of Adolf Hitler and drew rebuke from Republican lawmakers.
This isn’t the first time that Trump has invoked race science. In 2020 he praised a nearly all-white crowd at a rally in Minnesota for having “good genes,” pointing to a belief that has been touted by white supremacists called “racehorse theory.”
“You have good genes. You know that, right? You have good genes. A lot of it is about the genes, isn’t it, don’t you believe? The racehorse theory. You think we’re so different? You have good genes in Minnesota,” Trump said at the 2020 rally."
3842,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-07-11,"Court in Japan allows transgender woman to officially change gender without compulsory surgery
TOKYO (AP) — A Japanese high court has approved a legal gender change for a transgender woman without requiring compulsory gender-affirming surgery, a step that LGBGQ+ groups on Thursday called a mixed victory.
Under the law, transgender people who want to have their gender assigned at birth changed on official documents must be diagnosed as having gender dysmorphia and must undergo an operation to remove their sex organs.
The Hiroshima High Court ruled Wednesday that the current requirement is possibly unconstitutional, signalling a change in how gender issues are being addressed in Japan.
The claimant, only identified as a resident of western Japan in her late 40s, was assigned male at birth. Her request for a legal gender change in her documents was rejected by lower courts. She has argued through her lawyers that the surgery requirement forces a huge economic and physical burden and that it violates the constitution’s protection of equal rights.
The Supreme Court, in a landmark decision in October, ruled that the sterilization requirement is unconstitutional but sent the transgender woman’s case back to the High Court, ordering it to reexamine if the claimant can avoid a gender-affirming surgery, something it failed to address in its earlier ruling.
The hormonal therapy sufficiently feminized the claimant’s body, including her genitalia, without the surgery, the court said.
Wednesday’s decision now allows the claimant to have her gender in official records match her identity.
One of her lawyers, Kazuyuki Minami, who informed his client of the ruling on the phone, said she cried with relief.
Members of the Japan Alliance for LGBT Legislation, in a statement Thursday, said that the Hiroshima ruling can be considered progress because “it can open the door for transgender females to be able to legally change their gender without undergoing surgery.” But it said questions remain because it fell short of including those who cannot take hormones.
The group said it will keep fighting discrimination against transgender people.
The decision comes at a time of heightened awareness of issues surrounding LGBTQ+ people in Japan. The ruling that allows the claimant’s legal gender change without her surgery could be especially beneficial for transgender females, whose affirmation care tends to face greater controversy. But the high court ruling, unlike that of the Supreme Court, is not legally binding."
2182,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-06-07,"As US President Joe Biden arrived in France for a four-day visit aimed at commemorating 80 years since D-Day and deepening transatlantic ties, Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a new threat.
At an economic summit in St. Petersburg on Wednesday, Putin warned that Russia could provide long-range weapons to countries that might use them to strike Western strategic facilities.
Putin presented his latest threat as a response to NATO members – notably the United States and Germany – reversing course to allow Ukraine to use Western weapons for limited strikes inside Russia.
“If they think it’s possible to deliver such weapons to a combat zone to launch strikes on our territory and create problems for us, why don’t we have the right to supply weapons of the same type to some regions of the world, where they can be used to launch strikes on their sensitive facilities?” Putin asked.
As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed France's National Assembly on Friday after taking part in marking D-Day, Russia escalated its warnings that the West was playing with fire with its support to Kyiv.
A Russian foreign ministry spokesperson said Friday that US-supplied HIMARS (rocket launchers) had “murdered” a woman and child in Russia’s southern Belgorod region. It was the first time that Moscow has held the United States responsible for Russian civilian deaths.
The Kremlin also accused French President Emmanuel Macron of “inflaming tensions” following his promise to transfer French Mirage 2000-5s fighter jets to Ukraine.
""Macron demonstrates absolute support for the Kyiv regime and declares readiness for France's direct participation in the military conflict,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. ""We consider these statements to be very, very provocative, inflaming tensions on the continent and not conducive to anything positive.""
Vague threats
Putin’s warning about arming enemies of the West came as Moscow tries to project its naval power around the world, according to US officials.
Moscow is planning naval drills in the Caribbean this summer, according to media reports, citing US officials. The exercises will likely include port calls in Cuba and Venezuela, two Latin American countries that have unequivocally supported Moscow's war in Ukraine.
""Russia wants to scare the West with weapons proliferation and seems to be trying to expand the confrontation region with the West,"" said Jeff Hawn, a Russia specialist at the London School of Economics.
But Putin’s rhetoric “remains very vague”, with no details of the arms deployment provided, noted Joseph Moses, military strategy expert at the International Team for the Study of Security (ITSS) Verona.
The aim remains “to scare Western leaders and to provide ammunition to people sympathetic with Putin’s worldview, and to those who want a quick peace in Ukraine whatever the cost"", explained Hawn. Putin remains deliberately vague in the hope of swaying public opinion in the West, allowing listeners to interpret his threats according to their own fears.
Extending Russia’s foothold in Africa
But some experts note that Russia’s choice of friendly countries willing to sign up for this latest plan is limited.
Putin's threats “could mean expanding its military equipment signature in Belarus”, said Moses. “The other path of least resistance are the African countries, where we are seeing a pivot away from Europe and America.""
There are increasing signs of Russia seeking closer military cooperation with several African nations. Moses noted that Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s whirlwind tour of sub-Saharan Africa this week included visits to Burkina Faso and Chad for the first time.
""In terms of providing military and kinetic aid to other countries, my assessment is that we can expect an intensifying of Russia’s foothold in central Africa,"" said Moses. Russia and the Democratic Republic of Congo signed a military cooperation agreement in March in Moscow’s bid to rebrand the Wagner Group’s operations in Africa.
While this part of Africa is not home to many strategic Western sites, the influx of new Russian weapons could be an additional destabilising factor in the region.
The ‘dominant power’ in the Americas
Sub-Saharan Africa may not be the only destination for Russian weapons targeting Western interests. ""The most likely candidates are Iran and North Korea. Russia is already kind of doing it anyway, but no one wants to see these countries with even more weapons to threaten the West,” said Veronika Poniscjakova, a specialist in international security issues and the Ukraine war at the University of Portsmouth.
On the other hand, Russia’s ability to deliver more weapons with impunity to its Latin American allies are limited. These countries would also have to agree to strike at Western strategic interests, which is far from certain.
Venezuela and Cuba “recognise that the US is “by far the dominant power in the region” of Latin America, Hawn said.
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko represents a textbook case of an “ally” unwilling to venture too far down the path of war against the West, he noted. “In Belarus, Lukashenko is trying hard to not go to deep into the war even though he is claiming that he is a hundred percent on Putin's side.”
In addition, Russia can ill afford to flood the world with weapons in an attempt to export its war in Ukraine.
“They can, of course, send military advisers and – more importantly – battlefield data on the performance of drones and weapons platforms, and how they have fared against Western systems. This intelligence is very important,” said Moses. “Since Russia has a high rate of production [for] cruise missiles, it is possible that they could [export them] – as well as drones ranging from large platforms to smaller, copter hand-held drones. It could also provide these countries with 'dumber' options like artillery shells, which Russia has in large quantities.""
But given Russia’s weapons needs in Ukraine, Poniscjakova said Moscow is very unlikely to send any of its “good” weapons to other countries.
Hawn added that Western strategic sites are also “well protected against even the most modern weapons”.
‘A bear that cannot bite’
While Putin clearly felt compelled to react to the US and Germany agreeing to let Ukraine use Western missiles to strike targets on Russian territory, Moscow’s threats of retaliation are “essentially meaningless”, said Poniscjakova.
""At this point, it’s just complaining. It's like a bear that cannot bite.""
The upcoming naval exercises in the Caribbean are a classic example of this “Made in Moscow” communications war.
“It would be very surprising, given the state of the Russian fleet, if there were more than three or four ships sent to the Caribbean,” said Hawn. ""Most of the bluewater (open sea) hulls were built during the Cold War and are in bad shape. They can try to project power in the Caribbean, but I would be very surprised if they send more than three or four ships.""
Russian naval exercises in the Caribbean are also not unprecedented, Poniscjakova noted. Moscow participated in naval drills in the region in 2008 which were followed by naval training exercises with Iran and China in the Gulf of Oman.
These high-seas sorties, according to Poniscjakova, are simply opportunities for Moscow “to try and convince its allies that, despite two years of war in Ukraine, Russia is still capable of projecting its military power anywhere in the world”.

5772,fake,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-08-26,"Members of the Verkhovna Rada (MP), the Ukrainian parliament, just passed a new law that will effectively outlaw the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) throughout Ukraine unless it agrees to completely part ways with the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC).
Though a definitive link between the two sects of Orthodox Christianity cannot be 100 percent verified, reports indicate that suspected ties between the two are driving Ukrainian authorities to take action by trying to silence religious expression entirely, if need be.
The legislation overtly bans all ROC establishments and their affiliated religious institutions in Ukraine. It further threatens to prohibit all other forms of Christianity in Ukraine unless the various sects agree to comply with Zelensky's anti-Russia agenda.
""Among the people, it [is called] the law banning the Moscow Church,"" announced Ukrainian opposition MP Yaroslav Zheleznyak in a series of Telegram posts about the new law, which was approved by 265 deputies with only 29 voting against it and four abstaining.
Scheduled to take effect in 30 days, the legislation prohibits all activities of the ROC and its affiliates in Ukraine. The UOC will be given nine months to completely sever all ties with the ROC, whatever they might be.
(Related: Did you know that Germany has decided to stop sending new military aid to Ukraine after learning that Zelensky is responsible for bombing the Nord Stream pipelines?)
Back when Russia first began its offensive in Ukraine in February 2022, the UOC declared its full autonomy from the Moscow Patriarchate. Politicians in Kyiv, however, say UOC clergy is still communicating with ROC clergy, which is why Ukrainian police raids and arrests at UOC churches and facilities continue.
According to Verkhovna Rada Chairman and speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk, the new legislation will effectively make ""the Russian church in Ukraine"" illegal. Zelensky celebrated this by declaring that the ban will ""reinforce Ukraine's spiritual independence.""
The All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations (AUCCRO), the main organization representing all Christian denominations present in Ukraine, fully endorsed the new law. This means every ""church"" under its banner is in full compliance with Zelensky's anti-Russia platform.
The ROC, meanwhile, claims that UOC delegates were not even invited by AUCCRO to participate in negotiations about the law. They were deliberately excluded, Russia says, to reinforce the notion that all Ukrainian Christians are anti-Russia and agree with the law.
Interestingly, there are warring factions within the UOC that claim the other does not truly represent the UOC. The two main rival factions are the UOC and the Kyiv-backed Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU), which was formed as a union of two other Orthodox churches and by several members of the UOC.
The UOC remains the largest Orthodox church in Ukraine, boasting more than 8,000 parishes across the country. However, under pressure from the Zelensky regime, some of these parishes have been renouncing the UOC to join the OCU.
""Now we've got Zionists trying to reform the Christian Church?"" one commenter wrote about the insanity of the Zelensky regime trying to control Christian expression in Ukraine. ""What could possibly go wrong?""
""Zelensky and his criminal gang are simply doing the work of his father, the devil,"" wrote another.
""Churches will talk to other churches, and to anyone and everyone,"" wrote another."" It's their right. In essence, Ukraine's MPs don't want the church to exist at all.""
""This is the type of stuff Nero was worried about as Rome burned around him,"" said someone else.
""Hitler banned synagogues and Zelensky bans Christian churches,"" said another. ""The Bolsheviks also banned Russian Orthodoxy.""

WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump lamented the growing acceptance of transgender Americans Friday in an appearance at the annual gathering of Moms for Liberty, a national nonprofit that has spearheaded efforts to get mentions of LGBTQ+ identity and structural racism out of K-12 classrooms.
Trump said transgender women should not be allowed to play in women’s sports and said access to gender-affirming health care should be restricted. He also lashed out at critics who have accused him of using Arlington National Cemetery for a campaign photo op.
But he largely stuck to his favorite topics during an hourlong “fireside chat” in Washington, where he lashed out at President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, deplored illegal immigration and reminisced about his parents’ marriage, his path to being the reality television star of “The Apprentice” and the debate that ended Biden’s reelection campaign.
“Our country is being poisoned. And your schools and your children are suffering greatly because they’re going into the classrooms and taking disease, and they don’t even speak English,” Trump said of immigrants crossing the border illegally. “It’s crazy.”
Trump said school boards have become “like dictatorships” hostile to the desires of parents, echoing conservative frustration that bubbled over in public meetings during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“I’m for parental rights all the way. I don’t even understand the concept of not being,” Trump said.
Trump did not address the U.S. Army’s allegation that an Arlington National Cemetery official was “ abruptly pushed aside ” in an altercation with Trump aides this week while he visited the graves of servicemembers killed in a terrorist attack during the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. But he said he’s gotten to know the families and they asked to take a photo with him.
Photos of the cemetery visit showed Trump standing by the graves and flashing a thumbs-up sign next to relatives of Staff Sgt. Darin Taylor Hoover and Sgt. Nicole Gee.
“These people are devastated,” Trump said Friday. “These people can never ever be the same. And it was all because of Biden.”
Trump entered a hotel ballroom in Washington as he does at his signature rallies, standing and soaking up applause for the entirety of Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the USA,” followed by chants of “Trump, Trump, Trump.” Seated onstage with the co-founder of Moms for Liberty, Tiffany Justice, he shared some of his favorite stories that are mainstays at his rallies, bouncing from topic to topic in a style that has become familiar to his supporters.
The former president sought to shore up support and enthusiasm among a major part of his base. The bulk of Moms for Liberty’s 130,000-plus members are conservatives who agree with him that parents should have more say in public education and that racial equity programs and transgender accommodations don’t belong in schools.
Yet Trump also runs the risk of alienating some moderate voters, many of whom see Moms for Liberty’s activism as too extreme to be legitimized by a presidential nominee.
A year ago, Moms for Liberty was viewed by many as a rising power player in conservative politics that could be pivotal in supporting the Republican ticket. The group’s membership skyrocketed after its launch in 2021, fueled by parents protesting mandatory masking for students and remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.

But in the last several months, a series of embarrassing scandals and underwhelming performances during local elections have called Moms for Liberty’s influence into question.
The group also has voiced support for Project 2025, a detailed and controversial playbook for the next conservative presidency from which Trump has repeatedly tried to distance himself.
Moms for Liberty serves on the advisory board for Project 2025, and the author of the document’s education chapter taught a “strategy session” at the group’s Friday gathering.
The negative perceptions about Moms for Liberty around the country could increase the potential liability for Trump as he sits down with co-founder Justice, said University of Central Florida political science professor Aubrey Jewett.
“It certainly helps him rally his base,” Jewett said. “But will that be enough to outdo the backlash?”
In an interview before the event, Justice disputed the idea that her group’s influence is waning, pointing to the 60% of Moms for Liberty-backed candidates who won their recent races in the Florida primaries.
That’s “a really big deal,” she said, especially considering that many of the school board hopefuls the group endorses are first-time candidates running against incumbents. She also noted three Moms for Liberty members who won Florida House primaries, showing the group’s reach into other political offices.
Trump spent several minutes of the fireside chat discussing transgender issues in adult sports, including the recent Olympics, where vitriol erupted over a female boxer who was widely misidentified as transgender.
Trump falsely claimed Algerian boxer Imane Khelif “transitioned” and said he wouldn’t want to fight her. Khelif was assigned female at birth.
Trump’s education proposals include promoting school choice, giving parents more say in education and awarding funding preference to states and school districts that abolish teacher tenure, financially reward good teachers and allow parents to directly elect school principals.
He also has called for terminating the Department of Education, barring transgender athletes from playing in girls’ sports, and cutting funding from any schools pushing “inappropriate racial, sexual or political content” and from schools with vaccine mandates. He offered no new education proposals Friday.
The event took on a party-like atmosphere as the group awaited Trump’s arrival to a hotel ballroom in Washington. Donning shirts with messages like “Moms for Trump” and “We don’t co-parent with the government,” attendees at the group’s annual gathering ate buffet desserts, drank beer and cheered to a cover band playing country hits.
Vice President Kamala Harris has criticized her Republican opponent for his threats to dismantle the Department of Education. She also has spoken out against efforts to restrict classroom content related to race.
Democrats have lauded her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, for an executive order he signed protecting the rights of LGBTQ people to receive gender-affirming health care in his state. Republicans, including Trump, have lambasted him for it.
During a campaign stop earlier Friday in Johnstown in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, Trump offered extensive criticism of the media for what he called unfavorable coverage and singled out CNN for its interview with Harris and Walz on Thursday.
Moments later, a man rushed the media area and made it over a bike rack barrier and close to a riser where television reporters were watching the rally. Private security pushed him back, and the man was eventually subdued by law enforcement using a Taser.
Trump at first said of the man, “he’s on our side,” but it’s not clear what his intent was. As police led the man away, the former president declared, “Is there anywhere that’s more fun to be than a Trump rally?”

3961,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-07-23,"AAP FACTCHECK – The shooter responsible for Donald Trump’s attempted assassination was supposedly a transgender woman, according to posts on social media.
Users are pointing to an image, originally posted to a social media account of a transgender woman called Rose, claiming it depicts Thomas Crooks.
This is false. AAP FactCheck spoke to Rose on July 22 – several days after Crooks was killed – via the social media account on which she originally posted the image.
There are also clear differences in the facial features of Crooks and Rose.
The claim is the latest related to the identity of the gunman. Many of the posts making the new claim are transphobic.
An X post showing a picture of Rose garnered more than two million views, with the caption reading: “Anyone wondering why they aren’t using this photo of the shooter?”
Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones replied to the post, saying “A government run cult!”.
The image is also being shared widely on Facebook.
“Thomas Matthew Crooks was a trans woman,” one post reads.
“The media doesn’t want to share the more recent picture of Crooks,” another says.
AAP FactCheck traced the image back to an Instagram account of a person called Rose.
“Haven’t posted here in a while, so here’s some recent pics of me,” the caption reads on the June 23 post.
It features several images, including the one used for the false claim.
AAP FactCheck contacted Rose on July 22 via her X account, and then through the Instagram account. She said she was the person in the images from the post.
While there are some similarities to the appearance of Crooks in the image chosen for the false posts, there are also clear differences.
These are more apparent in the other images Rose used in her June 23 post.
Most notable are the shape of the nose and chin.
There are also no known images of Crooks featuring any piercings.
The earliest claim AAP FactCheck found related to the photo was made on anonymous message board 4chan on July 16.
The post’s author was questioned on the platform as to whether they were sure the image was Crooks.
“Not really, but spreading rumors is fun,” they reply.
Independent journalist and activist Erin Reed also spoke to Rose and produced her own debunk, which mirrors AAP FactCheck‘s findings.
It includes a timestamped photo of Rose taken after Crooks’s death.
At the time of writing, no evidence suggests Crooks was a transgender woman.
The motivation behind his attack remains unclear.
AAP FactCheck has previously debunked multiple claims misidentifying the would-be assassin.

4339,real,ANTI_MIGRATION_AND_XENOPHOBIA,2024-10-17,"Cypriot President Christodoulides calls for more migration agreements with third countries and seeks to normalise relations with Syria, while stressing the need to invest in infrastructure to enable the return of Syrians.
President Nicos Christodoulides of Cyprus voiced support for establishing more strategic agreements with third countries to address migration issues.
Speaking to Euronews, the Cypriot president argued that the EU's agreement with Lebanon has delivered results. The agreement allocated economic aid to Beirut in exchange for cooperation in curbing illegal immigration to Europe.
Christodoulides said he is now ready to discuss other possible solutions including return hubs.
""We are ready to look at all options outside the box. But options that are also in line with international humanitarian law,"" he said.
According to Christodoulides, the UNHCR should be with the Cypriot government to ensure that what is being done is ""within the box and always within the framework of international legitimacy"".
Cyprus is one of the first EU countries to push for the normalisation of relations with Syria in order to facilitate the return of migrants. Since the 2011 civil war, many refugees who fled to Lebanon have attempted to reach Cyprus, located just off its shores.
But the Cypriot president is setting some necessary conditions.
""I'm not talking about the Assad regime where our positions are common. But that cannot prevent us from discussing the possibility of Syrians returning to their country,"" said the president.
""For these people to return there has to be infrastructure, if there are no hospitals, if there are no schools, no roads, these people cannot return.""
Efforts to resume talks with the Turkish side
Christodoulides spoke to Euronews just hours after he held a trilateral meeting with UN Secretary-General António Guterres and Turkish Cypriot leader Ersin Tatar, aimed at restarting negotiations on Cyprus, seven years after talks in Crans-Montana ended without a peace and reunification agreement.
""If we have a state that cannot function internally, it will not be able to function when it comes to Brussels, with many of the cases even creating a problem in Brussels,"" he said, explaining why this issue remains crucial for the EU.
He also hinted that it is in both the EU's and Cyprus' interest for the talks to continue and for progress to be made, adding, ""The common EU position is that we all want to see progress in Euro-Turkish relations. This progress also depends on resolving the Cyprus problem.""
Cyprus remains divided after Turkey's invasion in 1974 and a coup d'etat."

As the fall and winter seasons approach, the usual seasonal respiratory viruses, including flu and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, will also be on the rise. Vaccines are now available to help protect against these viruses.
The Conversation asked epidemiologist Annette Regan to explain why officials recommend that people get these shots over the coming months.
What strain is the new COVID-19 shot based on and why?
The COVID-19 vaccine has been updated several times since the original shot in 2020-21 to keep up with how the SARS-CoV-2 virus is changing.
In September 2023, the CDC recommended that all people get the newly updated vaccine that was designed to protect against XBB.1.5, the variant that had been dominant in the U.S. that summer, regardless of whether they had received all recommended shots in the past.
Now, in August 2024, the XBB.1.5 variant is no longer around and has been replaced by the KP.2 and KP.3 variants, which make up more than 60% of variants currently detected.
Moderna and Pfizer both made updated formulations of the COVID-19 shot that target this new KP.2 variant. It is a monovalent vaccine, which means it includes only the KP.2 strain.
This strain was selected because it was the most common variant at the time the choice was made. Even when new variants such as KP.3 emerge, we researchers expect the updated vaccine to protect against the newer strains. For example, the 2023-24 vaccine was designed to target the XBB.1.5 strain, and studies showed that it continued to protect against the JN.1 variant that later emerged.
The CDC recommends a single shot for everyone 6 months and older, with some exceptions. Children 6 months to 4 years old who have not received any prior shots of COVID-19 vaccine still need two or three shots of the updated 2024-25 vaccine. Adults 65 and older and children and adults with certain health conditions may require an additional shot as well.
People who recently had a SARS-CoV-2 infection may consider delaying their shot for three months after the illness, since risk of reinfection is thought to be low during the months after infection.
How did the 2023 updated vaccine perform?
Recent studies have shown that people who received the 2023-24 vaccine were 54% less likely to develop symptomatic COVID-19 illness, 39% to 51% less likely to visit an emergency department or urgent care with COVID-19, and 50% to 53% less likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19 compared with unvaccinated people.
The vaccine was most effective among those who had received their shot more recently.
What is the best timing for the shots?
COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths have been rising since May 2024, with the highest rates seen in adults 65 and older and infants under 6 months old. Therefore, public health experts are recommending that people get the COVID-19 shot as soon as possible to protect against severe illness.
Because infants younger than 6 months are not old enough to be directly vaccinated, COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy is the best way to protect these babies.
When it comes to the flu, cases and hospitalizations seem to rise steeply between November and December. Some years, however, such as the 2022-23 flu season, they start as early as October.
It’s important to remember that vaccines do not offer immediate protection. You need about two weeks for your body to generate enough antibodies to offer protection. September or early October is a good time to get the flu shot to ensure you are protected in time. However, if you aren’t able to get the shot before November, it’s important to know that it is still helpful to get the shot as long as flu is around.
Is it OK to get both the COVID-19 and flu shots at the same time?
Getting the COVID-19 and flu shots together can certainly make it easier to get up to date with these recommended vaccinations. Data shows that getting the flu shot and the COVID-19 shot together is safe and effective.
Some vaccine companies are working to develop a combined flu/COVID-19 vaccine to reduce the number of shots needed. This vaccine still needs to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration but could become available soon.
Who should get the RSV shot and when?
RSV is another common respiratory virus that can cause severe illness in young children and older adults. There are two groups of people who should get one of the three currently available RSV vaccines: adults 60 years and older and pregnant people. The CDC recommends a single dose of either GSK’s AREXVY, Moderna’s mRESVIA or Pfizer’s ABRYSVO for all adults 75 years and older and adults between the ages of 60 to 74 who are at increased risk of severe RSV disease.
Unlike the COVID-19 and flu shots, additional RSV doses are not currently recommended, because research suggests that the vaccine offers protection for at least two RSV seasons. These vaccines are relatively new, however, and more data will be needed to see how long this protection really lasts. Additional doses may be recommended in the future.
The CDC recommends only Pfizer’s shot for people in weeks 32 to 36 of pregnancy between September and January. The Pfizer vaccine is the only RSV vaccine that has been licensed and approved for use in pregnancy.
These vaccines are different from the antibodies that can be given to infants at or after birth, called Beyfortus (nirsevimab). The CDC recommends one dose of nirsevimab for infants who are younger than 8 months old born during or shortly before their first RSV season. For some children who are 8 to 19 months old and are at increased risk of severe RSV disease, a dose of nirsevimab may also be recommended during their second RSV season.
Both the RSV vaccine and nirsevimab offer safe and effective options for preventing RSV in young babies.
Pregnant people should get advice from their health care professionals about which option is best for them.

Per Daily Mail:
The 40-year-old, who was listed as a director of Pride in Surrey until June, appeared in court on Thursday accused of committing the offences over a two-year period from August 2022 to last month.
He was joined in court by David Sutton, 26, a fellow former Pride in Surrey volunteer who is accused of voyeurism, possession of extreme pornography, conspiracy to sexually assault a child and plotting to kidnap a youngster.
The pair, both from Addlestone in Surrey, were arrested on Wednesday and have since remanded into custody to appear in court again on September 12.
Ireland claims on his social media to be a patron of Educate and Celebrate, a LGBT+ charity which caused controversy after encouraging toddlers to question their gender.
The non-profit, which was set up by Dr Elly Cannon, said it had hoped to ’embed gender, gender identity and sexual orientation into the fabric’ of organisations including primary schools.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Extreme partisanship combined with a complicated and highly decentralized voting system have led to a loss of faith in election results among some in the U.S., according to a bipartisan report released Tuesday that calls for greater transparency and steps to make voting easier.
The report noted that even in “normal times” elections are complex in a nation with thousands of voting jurisdictions and where the rules vary widely from state to state, and even between local governments.
“Of course, these are not normal times,” it said, noting that rancor and rhetoric have replaced problem-solving. “Nowhere is this more evident than with the partisan gamesmanship played over the very heart of this great democracy — the way we elect our leaders.”
The report by The Carter Center and the Baker Institute for Public Policy lays out 10 principles for trying to balance equal access to the polls with ensuring the integrity of election results.
Among other things, it recommends election laws that are clear and well-communicated, easy but secure voter registration, regular audits of local voting procedures and transparency in counting the votes.
In part, the report says its recommendations are an attempt to address “a tumultuous period of domestic unrest, one of the most polarized in American history.”
What to know about the 2024 Election
- Democracy: American democracy has overcome big stress tests since 2020. More challenges lie ahead in 2024.
- AP’s Role: The Associated Press is the most trusted source of information on election night, with a history of accuracy dating to 1848. Learn more.
- Read the latest: Follow AP’s complete coverage of this year’s election.
The principles are part of a cooperative effort that began in 2020 between the two institutions. It was inspired by the collaboration between former President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat, and former Republican Secretary of State James A. Baker III in 2005, when they served as co-chairs of the bipartisan Commission on Federal Election Reform.
The two organizations have worked together on other issues, including several conferences on U.S. elections, but the principles released Tuesday are their first to examine the nation’s election system and policies.
David Carroll, director of the Carter Center’s Democracy Program, said the lack of uniformity in election laws and procedures represents “the beauty, the complexity and the challenge” of running elections and guiding public perception in the U.S. The country has some 10,000 voting jurisdictions.
Election integrity has been a concern in the aftermath of the 2020 election, as former President Donald Trump and his allies made false claims of widespread fraud and spread conspiracy theories about voting machines. Recounts, reviews and audits in the battleground states where Trump contested his 2020 loss repeatedly showed that Biden had won. Trump’s former attorney general also acknowledged that there was no widespread voter fraud, and Trump lost dozens of court challenges, including several before judges he appointed.
Carroll said challenging election results and the integrity of the voting process is a relatively new development.
”Extreme polarization really has led, I think, to more questioning of election processes that, ironically, have only improved significantly over the last 25 years,” he said. “So while the doubts have gone up, the processes have actually become tighter and tighter and better and better.”
Mark Jones, a political scientist at Rice University and co-director of the Baker Institute’s Presidential Elections Program, said the majority of states have been making improvements to areas such as voter registration, flexibility in voting and voting technology.
“No state is perfect, nor is our goal to have every state be homogenous,” he said.
The group’s principles are suggestions for making further improvements, he said. If voter photo ID is a requirement, for example, “make sure that everybody who needs one can get one without a great deal of effort or hardship,” Jones said.
The groups also are encouraging states to have votes counted as close to Election Day as possible. Waiting a week — or several weeks — for an outcome undermines confidence in the system, he said.
Amy Cohen, executive director of the National Association of State Election Directors, said she had not seen the recommendations but said election officials are constantly trying to improve. She said there are “thousands” of elections each year and that each one is seen “as an opportunity to iterate and improve and get better.”
Election officials are aware that the length of time it takes to announce results can have an effect on some voters’ trust in the outcome, she said. She noted that the timelines for counting mailed ballots are not directed by election officials but rather set by statutes passed by state legislatures.
“We need to normalize the fact that it just takes longer to tabulate election results accurately,” she said.
In the current environment, she agreed that educating voters about those processes should be a priority.
“Given the proliferation of false information about elections, proactive communication and communication in general has taken on a lot more importance,” she said."
2308,real,ANTI_MIGRATION_AND_XENOPHOBIA,2024-05-11,"Poland’s prime minister vows to strengthen security at EU border with Belarus
WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Saturday traveled to the country’s border with Belarus, which is also the European Union’s external border with the autocratic state, and pledged to do more to strengthen security along its entire eastern frontier.
Tusk accused Belarus, Russia’s ally, of intensifying what he called a “hybrid war” against the West by encouraging migrants to try to cross into the EU. He vowed that Poland would spare no expense on its border security.
“I know that there are more and more illegal crossings every day,” Tusk told reporters at the border, where he met with Polish army soldiers, border guard officers and police. He also cited “the growing threat resulting from the Russian-Ukrainian war, Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and the uncertain geopolitical situation.”
The visit to the border, Tusk’s first since he took office in December, comes after a Polish judge defected to Belarus this month. He claimed he was facing persecution in Poland, a democracy, but officials have denounced him as a traitor and he is being investigated on suspicion of espionage.
Tusk replaced a national conservative party at odds with the EU over rule of law issues. That party, Law and Justice, took a strong stance against migration in a way that set it at odds with other European allies when it first took power in 2015.
Since then, though, the general mood against migration across Europe has toughened. While Tusk does not use some of the harsh anti-migrant rhetoric of his predecessors, he too is opposed to unregulated migration.
“This is not only Poland’s internal border, but also the border of the European Union. Therefore, I have no doubt that all of Europe will have to — and I know that we will achieve this — invest in its security by investing in Poland’s eastern border and in the security of our border,” Tusk said.
He added that he made a declaration to the commanders of the security forces at the border “there are no limits on resources when it comes to Poland’s security.”
The visit comes weeks ahead of next month’s elections for the European Parliament, and Tusk seemed intent on sending a message to voters that his political party, Civic Coalition, favors border security and supports the uniformed officers there.
“I came today primarily so that both commanders and their subordinates have no doubt that the Polish state and the Polish government are with them in every situation, here at the border,” he said.
A crisis erupted along the EU’s eastern border with Belarus in 2021 when large numbers of migrants from the Middle East and Africa began arriving there. The EU accused Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko of encouraging the migration to destabilize the EU after it imposed sanctions on the country for an election widely viewed as fraudulent.
Poland’s previous government responded to the crisis by constructing a tall steel wall."

Expressing frustration, Röpcke highlighted the stark contrast between the ample missile reserves in Germany's depots and Ukraine's dire situation, labeling Kyiv's airspace as vulnerable to Russian fighter jets. (Related: Ukraine running out of tanks as military struggles to repair machinery damaged by Russia.)
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky lamented the inability of their ground troops to intercept all incoming cruise missiles during a recent Russian assault, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced military support from NATO allies.
Zelensky urged for additional air defense systems and missiles, particularly to safeguard cities like Kharkiv from ongoing Russian attacks, which he denounced as deliberate acts of terror.
The dwindling supply of air defense resources coincides with waning enthusiasm from U.S. lawmakers for further military aid, with a $60 billion package stalled in the House of Representatives.
General Christopher Cavoli, the U.S. commander of European Command, emphasized the critical role of U.S. support in sustaining Ukraine's defense capabilities, warning of dire consequences if assistance is not provided promptly.

In a related development, Zelensky announced Germany's commitment to supply a U.S.-made Patriot air defense system and missiles amid escalating tensions and increased Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.
The recent bombardment of power stations and substations by Russian forces has left Kyiv urgently seeking advanced air defense capabilities.
Expressing appreciation for German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's decision, Zelenskyy emphasized the critical timing of the support as Ukraine faces relentless assaults. He called on leaders of other partner states to emulate Germany's proactive stance in assisting Ukraine's defense efforts.
This latest delivery adds to the ongoing efforts to bolster Ukraine's air defense capabilities, with Germany previously supplying various armaments to aid in Ukraine's defense against Russian aggression. According to a German government summary released on April 10, two Patriot systems have already been delivered, marking this as the third such delivery from Germany.
Zelensky's call for 25 U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems highlights the magnitude of Ukraine's defense needs in the face of Russian military aggression.
Germany's shift from its traditional pacifist stance to becoming a significant military aid provider underscores the gravity of the situation and the international community's response to support Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression.
The MIM-104 Patriot (Phased Array Tracking Radar to Intercept On Target) system serves as the primary air and missile defense system for the U.S. Army.
Initially designed for anti-aircraft purposes, the latest versions of the Patriot system are capable of detecting, targeting, and tracking ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as aircraft.
Development of the Patriot system began in the early 1960s to replace the Nike Hercules and Hawk air defense missile systems.
Initially named Surface-to-Air Missile, Development (SAM-D), the program underwent testing in 1969 and 1970. In the 1970s, the Department of Defense upgraded SAM-D to include a Track-Via-Missile (TVM) guidance system. Renamed Patriot, the updated system entered full production in 1980, with the Army activating its first Patriot missile battalion in May 1982.
According to Raytheon Missiles and Defense, the company responsible for designing and manufacturing the Patriot, the system has been utilized by five nations in over 250 combat engagements since its field activation in 1982. Raytheon has delivered more than 240 Patriot systems to 17 nations.

Huge, fast-moving wildfires have destroyed up to half of the historic Canadian town of Jasper, officials say, as firefighters try to save as many buildings as possible.
Entire streets have been levelled by the blazes in Alberta province, with video showing smouldering rubble where homes once stood.
Cooling temperatures brought some relief on Thursday, but park authorities said the fires were still out of control and further warm weather was forecast.
Meanwhile, there are hundreds of active blazes in neighbouring British Columbia, while fires are burning in western US states including California and Utah.
While no deaths have been reported, some 20,000 tourists and 5,000 residents have fled the mountainous area in Alberta province - a hugely popular tourist spot.
Some 36,000 hectares (89,000 acres) of land has so far been affected, Jasper National Park reported late on Thursday night local time - adding that neighbouring communities were not at risk.
It said that efforts to map the fires had been complicated by factors including strong winds, the extreme nature of the fire, and smoke.
During a news conference on Thursday, a tearful Alberta Premier Danielle Smith struggled at times to recount the scale of the damage, but said ""potentially 30 to 50%"" of buildings had been destroyed.
""There is no denying that this is the worst nightmare for any community,"" she said, adding that Jasper National Park had been ""a source of pride"" for many generations.
Ms Smith became visibly emotional as she described the beauty of the park and its significance to the community, which relies largely on tourism. Some 2.5 million people visit the park, and nearby Banff National Park, each year.
Rail, phone and power services in the area have been affected, CBC News reported.
Karyn Decore, the owner of the Maligne Lodge in Jasper, was on holiday when she learned her hotel had burned down. On Wednesday night, she received a photograph of the building in flames.
""I was horrified and devastated when I saw that photo,"" she told the BBC. ""I think it's going to take a couple of days for the shock to wear down.""
""It's really hard for everyone to comprehend that we lost one of our properties,"" she said, adding that she intended to rebuild the lodge.
BBC journalist Wendy Hurrell was in the town of Golden, on the edge of Jasper National Park, when the fires began to burn on Monday.
""The storm was ferocious - the skies went dark red and there were whipping winds, fierce rain and lightning,"" she said.
""We are some of the last travellers to see Jasper in its full beauty - it will be a very long time before it will recover. It's utterly devastating for them all and my heart is breaking.""
Hundreds of firefighters from around the world have been deployed to help with the response, but officials warn the extent of the damage is still emerging. The focus on Thursday, they said, was on containing the towering flames which engulfed the town from two sides.
Pierre Martel, director for the national fire management programme at Parks Canada, said the fire was started by a lightning storm and escalated late on Wednesday as it was fanned by powerful winds.
""It [was] just a monster at that point,"" Mr Martel said. ""There are no tools we have in our tool box to deal with it.""
The flames reached 100m (328ft) high in some places, covering ""an inordinate amount of space in a very little amount of time"", one official said.
Mike Ellis, Alberta's minister for public safety, said the fire was 5km (3 miles) outside of Jasper when it was pushed by the winds to the town in ""less than 30 minutes"".
""Any firefighter will tell you there is little to nothing you can do when you have a wall of flames coming at you like that,"" he said.
""Nobody anticipated that fire to come so fast, so large and so quickly.""
Justin Trudeau, Canada's prime minister, thanked the emergency services for their response to the wildfires.
""As the heartbreaking images from Jasper emerge, I want to thank the brave first responders who are in Alberta right now, fighting to save every home and every community they can,"" he said.
This marks another year of difficult fire conditions for the province. Last year, a record 2.2 million hectares burned in Alberta between 1 March and 31 October.
Other parts of western Canada and the US hit by fires
In British Columbia, the province neighbouring Alberta to the west, more than 400 wildfires have been burning and dozens of evacuation orders have been issued.
In the US, more than 3,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in the state of California due to the Park Fire, which continues to rage out of control.
A man has been arrested in connection with the blaze, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also known as Cal Fire, said.
The states of Oregon, Montana and Utah also continue to deal with wildfires.
The overall number of fires has decreased around the world over the last two decades.
But researchers say climate change could bring more lightning to forests in northern reaches of the globe, increasing the risk of wildfires.

Russian police raided several bars and nightclubs in Moscow early Saturday under laws criminalizing ""LGBT propaganda,"" state media reported.
During the raids, smartphones, laptops and video cameras were confiscated, while club-goers had their documents checked by officers, according to reports.
Footage shared on social media appeared to show partygoers being ordered by police to lie down on the floor as officers moved through the Arma nightclub in Moscow.
Another video showed people being escorted out of the popular gay club Mono in central Moscow with their hands over their heads as a police van parked outside.
The Interior Ministry said police had also raided an unnamed nightclub on Skladochnaya Street that had been ""propagandizing the ideology of the banned LGBT movement.""
Police also detained the head of the ""Men Travel"" travel agency under anti-LGBT laws, state-run news agency TASS reported. The agency said the 48-year-old was suspected of preparing a trip for ""supporters of non-traditional sexual values"" to Egypt over the Russian New Year holiday.
Anniversary of ban on 'international LGBT movement'
The raids came on the one-year anniversary of Russia's Supreme Court outlawing the ""international LGBT movement"" as an ""extremist organization,"" paving the way for arrests and prosecutions of the country's already repressed LGBTQ community.
This decision was the culmination of a decades-long crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights in Russia, where President Vladimir Putin has touted what he calls ""traditional family values"" as a cornerstone of his quarter-century in power.
Since launching its military attack on Ukraine nearly three years ago, the Kremlin has ramped up its conservative rhetoric. It has framed the conflict as a battle against the West and its values.
Other recent laws have also served to put pressure on those the Russian government believes don't conform to the country's ""traditional values.""
On November 23, Putin signed into law a bill banning the adoption of Russian children by citizens of countries where gender-affirming care is legal.
The Kremlin leader also approved a law banning the distribution of material that encourages people not to have children.

5231,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-08-28,"The current strain of avian flu, H5N1, is responsible for the culling of millions of domestic birds and has sickened more than a dozen farmworkers in 2024, most recently in Colorado.
The Conversation U.S. asked immunologist and microbiologist Jenna Guthmiller from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus to explain the historical roots of H5N1, its mode of transmission and how to avoid coming into contact with it.
What is H5N1?
H5N1 is a subtype of influenza A viruses. Other commonly known influenza A virus subtypes include H1N1 and H3N2, which cause seasonal outbreaks in humans.
Unlike H1N1 and H3N2, H5N1 largely infects wild birds, with waterfowl such as ducks and geese being the natural reservoirs for H5N1 viruses. Most H5N1 viruses are highly pathogenic avian influenza, meaning spillovers into other bird populations can lead to high mortality rates, including domesticated poultry.
H5N1 viruses were first identified in 1959 due to an outbreak in domesticated chickens in Scotland. In 1996, waterfowl were identified as the natural reservoir for H5N1.
Since its identification, H5N1 viruses have led to four major outbreaks: in 1997, 2003-2005, 2015 and 2021-to-present. The outbreaks in 1997 and 2003-2005 led to substantial spillover to humans.
Since 2003, nearly 900 H5N1 infections in humans have been recorded. Of those infections, more than half were fatal.
Where did H5N1 originate?
The current outbreak of H5N1 started in late 2021 and derives from the virus that caused a major outbreak in 2015.
Since 2021, H5N1 strains have spread to six continents by migratory birds. Spillover to domestic poultry has led to the culling of millions of domestic birds
Researchers have documented the current H5N1 strain in numerous mammals, with it largely affecting aquatic mammals like seals and scavenger mammals. Sporadic spillover to domestic mammals has been recorded, including to minks, goats and alpacas.
In March 2024, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported an outbreak of H5N1 in lactating dairy cows. As of Aug. 27, 192 herds in 13 states have been confirmed H5N1 positive.
Dairy cow-associated H5N1 viruses have since jumped back into wild birds, and recent outbreaks in domestic poultry resembled H5N1 in dairy cows. Between May and July 2024, 13 confirmed H5N1 infections have occurred in humans, with all cases directly linked to dairy farms and poultry culling.
Why did the avian flu become more widespread?
It is unclear why H5N1 has become such a widespread problem. H5N1, like all influenza viruses, rapidly mutates to infect new hosts. However, H5N1 has several features that could increase its host range.
First, H5N1 viruses use a protein called hemagglutinin that allows H5N1 to infect with new hosts.
Second, my research group identified a mutation in H5N1 viruses causing the dairy cow outbreak that allows hemagglutinin to bind to its receptor more efficiently.
Lastly, H5N1 viruses are mutating genes associated with replication and immune evasion that are known to increase the infection of mammals.
Together, these factors could heighten H5N1 transmission and increase H5N1 spillover to mammals.
How is the strain transmitted to dairy cattle?
H5N1 viruses are largely causing infections in the mammary glands of cattle rather than the respiratory tract, which is the main site of infection for other influenza viruses in mammals. Recent studies have shown that the mammary tissue has receptors for H5N1, which could make this tissue susceptible to infection.
Since the infection is largely restricted to the mammary glands, researchers believe that H5N1 is being transmitted to cows by contaminated milk equipment, particularly the milking apparatus that attaches to the cow udders. Transmission across farms is due to infected cattle movement and shared equipment and personnel across dairy farms.
To reduce transmission, in April 2024, the USDA put in testing requirements for when cows are transported across state lines. In addition, Colorado, the state with the greatest number of positive herds, requires weekly testing on farms to identify infected herds.
What are the risks to people and other animals?
H5N1 does not pose a risk to the general public, as this virus is not known to transmit between people. As all known cases were those with direct contact with infected animals, people with occupational exposure to H5N1-infected cows and poultry continue to be at the greatest risk of infection.
People with occupational hazards should be aware of the H5N1 symptoms – similar to those of a cold – such as congestion, sore throat and fatigue, as well as conjunctivitis, more commonly known as pink eye. For more information, see the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s webpage on avian influenza in people.
Domestic and wild animals near dairy farms are at high risk of infection. Particularly, barn cats that have been fed raw milk have been reported dead on dairy farms with infected cows, with these animals coming back positive for H5N1.
In addition, spillover of H5N1 to other domesticated farm animals near infected dairy cows has been recorded.
What are the best ways to keep farm workers safe?
Using personal protective equipment, such as goggles and gloves, remains the best way to prevent the transmission of H5N1 to humans and from humans back to animals. People working around poultry or dairy cattle should also be aware of biosecurity measures, such as not wearing the same clothes and boots when traveling from one farm to another.
Is drinking dairy milk a concern?
As long as you are consuming pasteurized milk products, there are no concerns for infections in humans. Pasteurization is very effective at killing any H5N1 virus that ends up in milk.
People should avoid raw or unpasteurized milk, as H5N1 virus has been found at very high levels in raw milk."
2965,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-07-29,"Russian forces are staging their heaviest assaults near the strategic eastern city of Pokrovsk, Kyiv’s military said on Monday, threatening a key supply route for Ukrainian troops struggling to fend off Moscow’s 29-month-old invasion.
Fighting on the Pokrovsk front was the fiercest anywhere in the war-scarred east, the General Staff said in a regular battlefield update, adding that Ukraine had fought off 52 Russian assaults there in the last 24 hours.
Pokrovsk, a transport hub with a pre-war population of 61,000, lies on a main road that serves as an important supply route to other embattled Ukrainian-held outposts, such as the towns of Chasiv Yar and Kostiantynivka.
“The greatest concentration of enemy attacks was around Zhelanne and Novooleksandrivka,” it said, citing two villages that lie to the east of Pokrovsk.
Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday that its forces had taken the villages of Prohres and Yevhenivka in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. Both settlements sit east of Pokrovsk. Kyiv did not comment on the claim.
Russia launched its full-scale invasion in Feb. 2022 and still occupies nearly a fifth of Ukraine. Ukrainian forces repelled the Russians from the outskirts of Kyiv early in the war and recaptured territory in the east and south later in 2022. But since a failed counteroffensive in 2023 Kyiv’s troops have mainly been on the defensive this year.
The attacks came as a German foreign ministry spokesperson said the country would not be intimidated by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s warning of a Cold War-style missile crisis.
Putin said on Sunday that if Washington deployed long-range missiles in Germany then Russia would station similar missiles in striking distance of the West.
“We will not be intimidated by such threats,” the spokesperson said.
Elsewhere, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had arrived in the Vovchansk area in the northeastern Kharkiv region, where Russian forces have been trying to advance since May.
“Today, I had the honour to be there to congratulate our Special Forces warriors on their professional day and to present them with state awards,” he said on X."
5220,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-09-25,"Russian lawmakers on September 25 approved the first reading of legislation that would ban the adoption of Russian children by citizens from countries where gender transition is legal in a nod to the Kremlin's crusade to protect what it views as ""traditional family values.""
The bill is moving through the State Duma -- led by the legislature's chairman, Vyacheslav Volodin -- along with two other pieces of legislation that would ban ""propagating child-free ideology"" and impose large fines for ""propagating childlessness.""
If approved in two subsequent readings and by the Federation Council, the ban would hit prospective parents from countries such as Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland, all of which allow for gender transitioning.
Last year, Russia adopted a law banning surgical operations ""aimed at changing the sex of a person"" and the changing of gender in documents. Separately, the Supreme Court decided in November to ban the nonexistent ""International Public LGBT Movement.""
Over the past decade, Russian President Vladimir Putin, with support from the dominant Russian Orthodox Church, has portrayed himself as a champion of what he describes as traditional values, a theme that plays well among many of his supporters in Russia.
In November 2022, less than nine months after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine was launched, Putin signed a decree supporting a 2021 document on Russia's ""traditional spiritual-moral values,"" including ""service to the fatherland,"" ""strong families,"" and ""the priority of the spiritual over the material.""
Among his initiatives, in July 2023 he signed into law a ban on gender-reassignment surgery and hormone therapy done as part of the gender-transition process.
Other bills that year aimed against ""Western anti-family ideology"" annulled marriages where one of the parties had ""changed gender,"" while also banning transgender people from adopting.
Russia had already banned adoptions from the United States in 2012 in retaliation to a U.S. law imposing asset freezes and visa bans on Russians accused by Washington of human rights abuses, including those believed involved in the death of a whistleblowing Russian lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, in a Moscow jail in 2009.
Russian authorities also have raised the issue of ""traditional family values"" to stressing the need to increase the birth rate in the country amid an ongoing decrease of the country's population.
Earlier on September 25, lawmakers in the Far Eastern region of Primorye adopted in all three readings a bill banning the ""inducement to abortions.""
Similar laws have been adopted since 2023 in several other Russian regions, including Mordovia, Tver and Kaliningrad.
Russian rights activists have expressed concern over moves to restrict access to abortions."
5485,real,ANTI_MIGRATION_AND_XENOPHOBIA,2024-08-13,"The Biden administration is planning to speed up the processing of asylum-seekers at the U.S.-Canada border in response to an unprecedented increase in migrant crossings there, according to internal Department of Homeland Security documents obtained by CBS News.
The effort involves two changes to how the U.S. processes migrants under a longstanding ""Safe Third Country"" asylum agreement with Canada. That accord, first signed in 2002 and expanded last year, allows U.S. and Canadian authorities to return asylum-seekers across their shared border under the premise that both nations are safe countries for people to request refuge.
The first change will require migrants to have their documents ready when U.S. asylum officers conduct screenings to determine if they are subject to the agreement with Canada. Previously, migrants could postpone those screenings to gather documents that could prove they merit an exemption to the deal. Certain groups, such as unaccompanied children and those with family members in the U.S., are not subject to the agreement.
The second change will reduce the time migrants have to consult with lawyers before their screenings with U.S. asylum officers to a minimum of four hours, down from a 24-hour minimum. That update matches an identical change made at the U.S.-Mexico border in June, in connection with President Biden's move to severely restrict asylum there.
Migrants who are subject to the Safe Third Country agreement are barred from U.S. asylum and can be returned to Canada. Those who qualify for an exemption are allowed to request asylum in the U.S. Conversely, those who cross into Canada from the U.S. and are subject to the agreement can be returned by Canadian authorities to American soil.
Both policy changes are slated to take effect on Wednesday, Aug. 14, according to internal DHS documents. In a statement to CBS News on Tuesday, DHS confirmed the actions, saying it continues to ""deliver tough consequences for noncitizens who do not have a lawful basis to remain in the United States.""
""DHS carefully reviewed its implementation of the Safe Third Country Agreement with Canada and concluded that it could streamline that process at the border without impacting noncitizens' ability to have access to a full and fair procedure for determining a claim to asylum or equivalent temporary protection,"" the department added.
While procedural in nature, both changes are aimed at allowing U.S. immigration officials to more quickly process and deport migrants who request asylum along the 5,500-mile northern border, where migrant apprehensions have spiked this year.
So far in fiscal year 2024, Border Patrol agents have taken into custody 16,500 migrants who crossed the U.S.-Canada border illegally, up from 10,000 in 2023 and just 2,200 in 2022, federal statistics show. The 2024 number is the highest Border Patrol apprehension tally along the northern border on record.
While crossings at the northern border continue to pale in comparison to the southern border — where Border Patrol has recorded over 1.3 million apprehensions so far in fiscal year 2024 — the increase in migrant arrivals there has posed major challenges for U.S. officials.
Border Patrol has many fewer agents and resources to patrol the vast U.S.-Canada border than it has along the border with Mexico. The terrain itself, which includes dense forests, mountainous areas and wilderness, makes the task of patrolling the northern border even more difficult.
The vast majority, or over 75%, of all migrant apprehensions at the northern border this year have occurred in the Swanton sector, an area that covers rural parts of New York, New Hampshire and Vermont, government figures show. The apprehensions there are higher than all those recorded in the area in the past 13 fiscal years combined, according to Robert Garcia, the top Border Patrol official in the Swanton sector.
While they reached record levels in the past three years, illegal crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border have dropped dramatically this year, plunging to the lowest level since September 2020 in July. Officials have attributed the massive drop in migration to Mexico's efforts to stop U.S.-bound migrants, increasing summer temperatures and Mr. Biden's move to curtail access to the American asylum system.
Mr. Biden's asylum crackdown, which is being challenged in federal court by migrant rights groups, applies only at the southern border, and nearby coastal sectors."
6058,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-10-08,"Evacuation orders have been issued as Florida braces for Hurricane Milton.
Hurricanes are humanity’s reminder of the uncontrollable, chaotic power of Earth’s weather.
Florida’s storm-battered Gulf Coast raced against a Category 5 hurricane on Monday as workers sprinted to pick up debris left over from Helene two weeks ago and highways were clogged with people fleeing ahead of the storm.
The centre of Hurricane Milton could come ashore on Wednesday in the Tampa Bay region, which has not endured a direct hit by a major hurricane in more than a century.
Scientists expect the system to weaken slightly before landfall, though it could retain hurricane strength as it churns across central Florida toward the Atlantic Ocean. That would largely spare other states ravaged by Helene, which killed at least 230 people on its path from Florida to the Carolinas.
'A losing proposition': Tampa unprepared for effects of Hurricane Milton
As evacuation orders were issued, forecasters warned of a possible 2.4 to 3.6-metre storm surge in Tampa Bay. That's the highest ever predicted for the region and nearly double the levels reached two weeks ago during Helene, says National Hurricane Center spokesperson Maria Torres.
The storm could also bring widespread flooding - 13 to 25 centimetres of rain was forecast for mainland Florida and the Keys, with as much as 38 centimetres expected in some places.
The Tampa metro area has a population of more than 3.3 million people.
“It’s a huge population. It’s very exposed, very inexperienced, and that’s a losing proposition,” says Massachusetts Institute of Technology meteorology professor Kerry Emanuel. “I always thought Tampa would be the city to worry about most.”
'If meteorologists could stop hurricanes, we would stop hurricanes'
Milton’s powerful push toward Florida just days after Helene devastated large parts of the southeast US has some in the region wondering if they are being targeted.
In some corners of the internet, Helene has already sparked conspiracy theories and disinformation suggesting the government somehow aimed the hurricane at Republican voters.
Besides discounting common sense, such theories disregard weather history that shows the hurricanes are hitting many of the same areas they have for centuries. They also presume an ability for humans to quickly reshape the weather far beyond relatively minor efforts such as cloud seeding.
“If meteorologists could stop hurricanes, we would stop hurricanes,” Kristen Corbosiero, a professor of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University at Albany. “If we could control the weather, we would not want the kind of death and destruction that’s happened.”
Here’s a look at what humans can and can’t do when it comes to weather.
The power of hurricanes, heightened by climate change
A fully developed hurricane releases heat energy that is the equivalent of a 10-megatonne nuclear bomb every 20 minutes - more than all the energy used at a given time by humanity, according to National Hurricane Center tropical analysis chief Chris Landsea.
And scientists are now finding many ways climate change is making hurricanes worse, with warmer oceans that add energy and more water in the warming atmosphere to fall as rain, says Chris Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment.
“The amount of energy a hurricane generates is insane,” says Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. It’s the height of human arrogance to think people have the power to change them, he says.
But that hasn't stopped people from trying, or at least thinking about trying.
Historical efforts to control hurricanes have failed
Jim Fleming of Colby College has studied historical efforts to control the weather and thinks humans have nowhere near the practical technology to get there. He described an attempt in 1947 in which General Electric partnered with the US military to drop dry ice from Air Force jets into the path of a hurricane in an attempt to weaken it. It didn't work.
“The typical science goes like understanding, prediction and then possibly control,” Fleming says, noting that the atmosphere is far more powerful and complex than most proposals to control it. “It goes back into Greek mythology to think you can control the powers of the heavens, but also it's a failed idea.”
In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the federal government briefly tried Project STORMFURY. The idea was to seed a hurricane to replace its eyewall with a larger one that would make the storm bigger in size but weaker in intensity.
Tests were inconclusive and researchers realised if they made the storm larger, people who wouldn’t have been hurt by the storm would now be in danger, which is an ethical and liability problem, the project director once said.
For decades, the National Hurricane Center and its parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), have been asked about nuclear-bombing a hurricane. But the bombs aren't powerful enough, and it would add the problem of radioactive fallout, Corbosiero says.
Bringing cooling icebergs or seeding or adding water-absorbing substances also are ideas that just don’t work, NOAA scientists say.
Climate change begets engineering - and lots of questions
Failed historical attempts to control hurricanes differ somewhat from some scientists' futuristic ideas to combat climate change and extreme weather. That's because instead of targeting individual weather events, modern geoengineers would operate on a larger scale - thinking about how to reverse the broad-scale damage humans have already done to the global climate by emitting greenhouse gases.
Scientists in the field say one of the most promising ideas they see based on computer models is solar geoengineering. The method would involve lofting aerosol particles into the upper atmosphere to bounce a tiny bit of sunlight back into space, cooling the planet slightly.
Supporters acknowledge the risks and challenges. But it also ""might have quite large benefits, especially for the world’s poorest,"" says David Keith, a professor at the University of Chicago and founding faculty director of the Climate Systems Engineering initiative.
Two years ago, the largest society of scientists who work on climate issues, the American Geophysical Union, announced it was forming an ethics framework for “climate intervention.""
Some scientists warn that tinkering with Earth’s atmosphere to fix climate change is likely to create cascading new problems. Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann expressed worries on the ethics framework that just talking about guidelines will make the tinkering more likely to occur in the real world, something that could have harmful side effects.
Field, of Stanford, agrees that the modelling strongly encourages that geoengineering could be effective, including at mitigating the worst threats of hurricanes, even if that's decades away. But he emphasises that it's just one piece of the best solution, which is to stop climate change by cutting greenhouse gas emissions.
“Whatever else we do, that needs to be the core set of activities,” he says."
2314,real,ANTI_MIGRATION_AND_XENOPHOBIA,2024-04-10,"The parliament's main political groups overcame opposition from far-right and far-left parties to pass the new migration and asylum pact – a sweeping reform nearly a decade in the making.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called the new rules a ""historic, indispensable step"" for the European Union.

The migration minister for Greece, one of the countries worst affected by arrivals of growing numbers of undocumented migrants, echoed this comment. ""This is a major breakthrough and a very important step towards a common, and therefore more effective, management of the migration challenges of our time,"" Migration Minister Dimitris Kairidis wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said the adoption of this reform was a ""huge achievement for Europe"". ""Today is indeed a historic day,"" the European Commission president told a news conference after the European Parliament adopted the reform.

EU home affairs commissioner Ylva Johansson said the bloc ""will be able to better protect our external borders, the vulnerable and refugees, swiftly return those not eligible to stay"" and introduce ""mandatory solidarity"" between member states.
Ten pieces of legislation in the overhaul were passed.
Outside the Brussels parliament building, dozens of demonstrators protested against the vote, echoing criticism from more than 160 migrant charities and non-governmental organisations who view it as a betrayal of European Union values.
In a sign of the fierce opposition, the start of voting was interrupted by protesters in the public gallery yelling ""This pact kills - vote no!"" until the chamber was brought to order.
But the UNHCR refugee agency's chief has endorsed the reform, drawn up by the European Commission since massive inflows jolted the bloc in 2015.

For the far-left, the reforms – which include building border centres to hold asylum-seekers and sending some to outside ""safe"" countries – were incompatible with Europe's commitment to upholding human rights.
It was ""a pact with the devil,"" said Damien Careme, a lawmaker from the Greens group.
Far-right lawmakers complained the overhaul did not go far enough to block access to irregular migrants, whom they accuse of spreading insecurity and threatening to ""submerge"" European identity.
""We won't allow ourselves to be replaced or submerged,"" Jordan Bardella, a lawmaker heading France's far-right National Rally party whose figurehead is Marine Le Pen, said in the pre-vote debate.
'Problematic elements'
The mainstream centrist right and left in parliament had called for the pact to be passed as an improvement over the current situation.
They warned that failure to pass the reforms would boost the far-right, predicted to become a bigger force in the European Parliament following June elections.
Sophie In 'T Veld, a key figure pushing the package through, acknowledged ""problematic elements, risks and weaknesses"", but said that overall it marked a step forward.
The pact's measures are to come into force in 2026, after the European Commission sets out in coming months how it would be implemented.
The new border centres would hold irregular migrants while their asylum requests are vetted, and speed up deportations of those deemed inadmissable.
It would also require EU countries to take in thousands of asylum-seekers from ""frontline"" states such as Italy and Greece. Alternatively, they could provide money or other resources to the under-pressure nations.
The German chancellor, commenting on X, the former Twitter, said the accord stands for ""solidarity among European states"" and would ""finally relieve the burden on those countries that are particularly hard hit"".
A controversial measure is the sending of asylum-seekers to countries outside the EU that are deemed ""safe"", if the migrant has sufficient ties to that country.
Deals with neighbours
The pact has wended through years of thorny talks and compromises ever since the bloc was confronted with large numbers of irregular migrants who arrived in 2015, many from war-torn Syria.
Under current EU rules, the arrival country bears responsibility for hosting and vetting asylum-seekers, and returning those deemed inadmissable. That has put southern states under pressure and fuelled far-right sentiment.
A political breakthrough came in December when a weighted majority of EU countries backed the reforms -- overcoming opposition from Hungary and Poland.
In parallel with the reform, the EU has been multiplying the same sort of deal it struck with Turkey in 2016 to stem migratory flows.
It has reached accords with Tunisia and, most recently, Egypt that are portrayed as broader cooperation arrangements. Many lawmakers have, however, criticised the deals.

The Biden administration’s “green energy” policies that have received support from some states aren’t as green as they seem – and can even lead to a potential collapse of the power grid.
Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT) President Craig Rucker made this remark in an op-ed published on Inside Sources. According to him, President Joe Biden’s energy policies cause a huge rise in electricity demand. In contrast, these same green mandates cut down on the U.S.’s power generation capacity.
The White House is mandating Americans to switch from fossil fuel-based appliances – like gas furnaces, stoves and water heaters – to all-electric versions. Additionally, vehicles with engines that run on gasoline and diesel fuel – including cars, trains and trucks – are being phased out in favor of battery-powered models. (Related: Study finds electric vehicles pollute the environment 1,850 times more than gas-powered cars.)
These drastic measures are expected to significantly increase electricity demand. Meanwhile, other regulations are reducing energy production by shutting down reliable coal, gas, hydropower and nuclear power plants. These are being replaced by costly and inconsistent wind and solar projects that depend on the weather and only produce 30 percent to 40 percent electricity.
Rucker also outlined several issues with this approach. One major concern is the massive cost of this “green transformation,” which could exceed $100 trillion. Another concern he mentioned was the impact of natural events.

For example, in March, severe thunderstorms destroyed 3,500 acres of solar panels near Houston. Before the storm, these panels could power 62,000 homes for eight to nine hours on a sunny day. Now, with many panels shattered, their output is much lower.
Despite this, Rucker said the U.S. Department of the Interior plans to install solar panels on 22 million acres of public lands in 11 Western states – an area almost as large as Indiana. This translates to 22 billion panels if installed at 1,000 panels per acre, not including those on rooftops or private lands. Even without damage, these panels can only last between 20 and 30 years.
Unfortunately, damaged solar panels can’t be recycled – raising questions about disposal logistics, costs and responsibilities. They can’t be recycled and must be disposed of in special landfills to avoid contamination from heavy metals and other toxic elements.
Wind turbines face similar issues, with onshore turbines lasting 20 to 25 years while off-shore ones having a shorter lifespan. Managing the disposal of thousands of massive off-shore turbines, along with their blades, generators and nacelles (the cover housing all of the generating components of the wind turbine), is a daunting task. The blades alone, which can’t be recycled, need to be cut into pieces and landfilled. (Related: Noise pollution from offshore wind turbines could lead to the EXTINCTION OF WHALES.)
Large batteries for power grids, trains and trucks also pose disposal challenges. They create fire hazards that are much more difficult to put out due to the chemicals used for their production. Such batteries also need careful handling during transport to landfills or recycling centers.
In the long run, thousands of wind turbines, billions of solar panels and new transmission lines will cover millions of acres of farmland, wildlife habitats and scenic areas. Keeping large backup batteries charged will require even more wind and solar installations.
America’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions could ultimately be overshadowed by the growing fossil fuel use in China and India, Rucker concluded. Instead of focusing solely on carbon emissions, Congress might need to reconsider the current energy transformation plans before natural events cause further damage.

Bill Gates spent four days in India meeting with political leaders, government officials, scientists, “philanthropists” and others.
According to Gates, The Gates Foundation funds more work in India than in any other country, other than the United States.
What were his goals during his recent trip to India? To sniff out opportunities to further implement his digital IDs and “smart farming.”

On Tuesday, Bill Gates published a blog stating that he had “found inspiration in India.” What he really meant he was pleased to find opportunities to enslave some of the world’s poorest and make a lot of money while doing so.
He met with India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, specifically about the way the world’s “biggest democracy” goes about implementing digital public infrastructure (“DPI”).
“We had a great conversation about how the Gates Foundation can continue to support India’s goals on digital technology, women-led development, and innovation in agriculture, health, and climate change,” Gates wrote about the hour’s discussion he had with Modi.
DPI is a term that in alarming unison crops up in various United Nations, European Union and associated groups’ policies and statements. “A buzzword that denotes the plan to introduce digital ID and digital payments literally wherever on Earth possible by 2030,” Reclaim the Net wrote.
Gates also met with Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani, who is one of the co-creators of the Aadhaar, a digital ID system and one of India’s key DPI components. Aadhaar has been a subject of controversy in India for its massive scale and privacy concerns.
Gates wrote: “In Hyderabad, I also met with Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani, whom I’ve known for years, and other experts who got me up to speed on the latest in digital public infrastructure, or DPI. That’s the system that is making it possible to use digital technology to provide all kinds of services, including digital payments, advice for farmers, education, and much more. India’s progress on DPI is a model that other countries are learning from.”
What Gates failed to mention is the rise of scams which involve Aadhaar numbers. Scams that use highly detailed information to appear genuine have been reported very frequently across the country over the past few months, NDTV reported.
In 2018, following up on an investigation by The Tribune, The Quint discovered that people without official credentials can gain access to and become administrators of the official Aadhaar database. This database contains the names, mobile numbers, and addresses of every Indian linked to the Unique Identification Authority of India (“UIDAI”) scheme, an alternative name for Aadhaar. However, the problem doesn’t end there. Once you are an admin, you have the power to select and give admin privileges to anyone you choose, regardless of their nationality. Furthermore, the Aadhaar database does not have any mechanisms in place to verify the legitimacy of the people who are granted access.
India is a union of states and has a quasi-federal form of government called a “union” or “central” government. Power is divided between the governments of the union and the states of India, the latter being ruled by the chief ministers. There are 28 states and 8 union territories. One of the states is West Bengal.
On 27 February 2024, The Quint reported that the Aadhaar IDs of people in West Bengal had been deactivated. The mass deactivation of Aadhaar numbers was attributed by Union Minister Shantanu Thakur to “some technical fault.” But questions remain as to what actually happened.
From the outset, concerns have arisen over the alleged targeted cancellation of Aadhaar cards, particularly affecting minority communities by the Union Government. The state government asserted that the Union Government intentionally targeted certain demographic groups, especially from the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities, through these deactivations. According to the chief minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, the cancellations had a disproportionate impact on minority populations across the state.
After marketing his dodgy digital IDs, Gates then went on in his blog to describe the marketing of what he calls “smart farming” in India. “I got to see India’s DPI in action when I toured an agricultural monitoring centre in Bhubaneswar. At this facility, government agriculture experts send advice and real-time updates to 6.5 million farmers via phone,” he said.
“The Gates Foundation supports a lot of work on agriculture in India, so I was excited to attend a learning session in New Delhi on Thursday with experts on livestock and crops. I learned about the latest innovations in artificial insemination, buffalo breeding, climate-smart seeds and much more,” he added.
Bill Gates is not “supporting” work on agriculture for the benefit of farmers or the population at large. He is taking control of the food supply across the world, including India, for his benefit and the benefit of his collaborators.
At the end of 2022, The ETC Group published a report titled ‘Food Barons 2022 – Crisis Profiteering, Digitalization and Shifting Power’. In it, The ETC Group describe how the “Food Barons” are introducing a suite of new technologies and “techno-fixes” that are conceived and designed to entrench corporate control over food and agriculture even further.
“Tech giants are becoming prime players in food, handling the data, networking and AI that undergirds the newly digitised food chain,” The ETC Group wrote introducing their report.
In the report, The ETC Group describe the “dream farm” of the Technocrats. It is a “farm of one” where technology does all the work and rakes in the profits:
Every leading agrochemical company offers its own digital ag platform marketed to farmers as a way to transform on-farm data into savings that will ultimately increase farm profitability:
The Holy Grail, they say, is a “farm of one,” where a single farmer/data manager (equipped with many thumbs, perhaps?) can log on to a connected device, watch as the algorithms calculate input prescriptions – based on data collected from in-field sensors and hyperspectral imaging – and then send those prescriptions to a fleet of contracted drones that will dump herbicide, fungicide, fertilizer, growth regulator or other input in a just-right dosage for each plant growing in the field.
Post-harvest, the farmer can supposedly sit back and enjoy the profits from increased crop sales and reduced labour costs – as well as from payments for ‘carbon sequestration’ verified by traceability data collected and stored on a blockchain.Food Barons 2022, ETC Group, September 2022, pg. 22
With Big Tech’s encroachment into agriculture, we have now moved from “Is this food safe to eat?” to “Is this even “food” and is it edible?”

2206,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-02-23,"The sanctions, described as the largest single tranche since the start of the Ukraine war, also seek to impose a cost for the death last week in a Siberian prison of Russian President Vladimir Putin's most vocal critic, Alexei Navalny, with measures taken against three Russian officials.
The sanctions targeted Russia's Mir payment system, Russian financial institutions and its military industrial base, evaders of previous sanctions, future energy production and other areas.
The latest US action seeks to hold Russia to account over the war and the death of Navalny, US President Joe Biden said in a statement, as Washington looks to continue to support Ukraine even as it faces acute shortages of ammunition and US military aid has been delayed for months in Congress.
""Today, I am announcing more than 500 new sanctions against Russia for its ongoing war of conquest on Ukraine and for the death of Aleksey Navalny [sic], who was a courageous anti-corruption activist and Putin’s fiercest opposition leader. These sanctions will target individuals connected to Navalny’s imprisonment as well as Russia’s financial sector, defense industrial base, procurement networks and sanctions evaders across multiple continents. They will ensure Putin pays an even steeper price for his aggression abroad and repression at home,"" said Biden.
The US Treasury Department targeted nearly 300 people and entities, while the State Department hit over 250 and the Commerce Department added over 90 companies to the Entity List.
It was an increase from last year, when the US imposed sanctions on more than 200 individuals and entities.
Friday's US sanctions came in partnership with those from EU member nations and Britain. The actions are the latest of thousands of targets announced by the US and its allies following Russia's February 24, 2022, invasion of Ukraine, which has killed tens of thousands and destroyed cities.
Earlier this week, the EU approved a package of Ukraine-related sanctions against Russia, banning nearly 200 entities and individuals accused of helping Moscow procure weapons or of involvement in kidnapping Ukrainian children.
Russia's export-focused, $2.2-trillion economy has proven more resilient to the unprecedented sanctions than either Moscow or the West anticipated.
US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called for sustained support for Ukraine in a statement issued Friday. ""We must sustain our support for Ukraine even as we weaken Russia’s war machine. It’s critical that Congress steps up to join our allies around the world in giving Ukraine the means to defend itself and its freedom against Putin’s barbarous assault,"" she said.
Targeting Russia's Mir payment system
The US Treasury slapped sanctions on Russia's state-owned National Payment Card System, the operator of the Mir payment system.
Mir payments cards have become more important since its US rivals suspended operations in Russia after Moscow sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine, and their payment cards which were issued in the country stopped working abroad.
""The Government of Russia's proliferation of Mir has permitted Russia to build out a financial infrastructure that enables Russian efforts to evade sanctions and reconstitute severed connections to the international financial system,"" the Treasury statement said.
Also targeted were over a dozen Russian banks, investment firms, venture capital funds, and fintech companies, including SPB Bank, which is owned by SPB Exchange, Russia's second-largest stock exchange which specialises in trading foreign shares.
Export restrictions on Russian, Turkish, Chinese entities
The action, one day before the second anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, means companies will be placed on the Commerce Department's ""Entity List,"" essentially banning US shipments to them.
Of the new entities listed, 63 were from Russia, 16 from Turkey, eight from China and four from the UAE.
The Commerce Department said some of the companies were added for their roles in diverting controlled microelectronics to Russia’s military and intelligence authorities.
Russian officials targeted over Navalny's death
The US State Department on Friday also targeted three Russian Federal Penitentiary Service officials it accused of being connected to Navalny's death, including its deputy director who it said reportedly instructed prison staff to exert harsher treatment on Navalny.
Navalny, 47, fell unconscious and died suddenly last week after a walk at the ""Polar Wolf"" penal colony above the Arctic Circle where he was serving a three-decade sentence, the prison service said.
Biden has directly blamed Putin. The Kremlin has denied the charges.
The US actions also targeted individuals involved in what the State Department called the forcible transfer or deportation of Ukrainian children to camps promoting indoctrination in Russia, Belarus and Crimea.

The carbon dioxide removal (CDR) industry has exploded in recent years. But removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is ridiculously expensive and completely unnecessary.
Nearly 800 companies around the world are exploring a wide variety of methods for drawing greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere and storing them away or putting them to use. This is a gigantic leap from 2019, when there were only a handful of startups that were interested in exploring the task of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
In 2021, the MIT Technology Review published an article discussing how the “hype” behind carbon removal “is becoming a dangerous distraction.”
“Carbon removal hype is becoming a dangerous distraction. Corporations and nations are touting plans to suck greenhouse gases out of the air … The noise, news and hype are feeding a perception that carbon removal will be cheap, simple, scalable and reliable – none of which we can count on,” the article said. (Related: CNN writer suggests forcing “carbon passport” on travelers to meet carbon footprint target by 2050.)
Venture capital firms that have already begun researching carbon removal have invested tens of millions of dollars into early-stage startups promising to use technology, minerals and microbes to draw carbon dioxide and promising to verify and certify that all the removal is really happening.
“You are seeing lots of people making big promises right now, and they don’t quite know how to keep them,” said Klaus Lackner, director of the Center for Negative Carbon Emissions at Arizona State University.

Even the most “natural” method of sequestering carbon – by getting carbon emissions sucked out of the air by trees or not released because they were captured by forests – is significantly higher, especially if governments and corporations force private citizens to bear the ongoing costs of monitoring carbon levels and the liabilities for additional carbon removal should trees die.
CDR technologies, which provide a means of sucking carbon out of the atmosphere, are one of the hottest areas of climate research, but also the most controversial.
This industry has seen new life following the release of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report which claims that ways of capturing and storing carbon dioxide, though expensive, might be necessary to keep global temperatures from changing too drastically.
But scientists and policymakers are divided. Some say that technology must be the immediate priority for research. Others urge caution and warn against putting faith in untested technology.
Large technological and corporate interests have invested in the kind of money that is involved in solving the “climate change” problem but not in an inexpensive way.
Research-based organizations have invested time, money and reputation in this issue so that having it cheaply eliminated would not be in their best interest.
A rash of new tech startups are cashing in on the perceived opportunity many companies and investors see in CDR. These fledgling companies are exploring “scrubbers” that can chemically remove carbon dioxide from the air.
Other startups are researching “biochar,” which creates fertilizer from burning wood waste without oxygen, and even more are focusing on carbon capture and storage tech, which liquefies carbon dioxide and pumps it deep into the earth in geological formations where it can stay forever. The IPCC’s report has been seen as a stamp of approval to continue their research and to keep lobbying for investments.
Watch this video discussing the challenges of carbon capture and removal, and how carbon sequestration is sometimes unsustainable.

3664,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-10-11,"COVID-19 infections during 1st wave linked to higher risk of heart attack and stroke: Study
Elevated risks were particularly seen in unvaccinated people who fell ill.
People who were diagnosed with severe COVID-19 infections from the first wave of the pandemic could face double the risk of heart attack and stroke, a new study has found.
The study, published this week in the journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology and supported by the National Institutes of Health, found the elevated risk could last for up to three years
Researchers focused on the long-term cardiovascular risks for unvaccinated people who were sick with the virus during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019 and 2020.
Compared to someone who never had COVID-19, the likelihood of heart attack, stroke and death doubled for anyone who was ever ill with the virus, and was four times higher for people who required hospitalization, the study found.
The elevated danger persisted for more than three years after the initial infection, which, according to the study, posed a serious cardiovascular threat comparable to that of type 2 diabetes.
""Findings suggest severe COVID-19 infection as a catastrophic component,"" Dr. Hooman Allayee, the study's principal investigator, told ABC News. ""Cardiovascular mortality trends from 2010 to 2019 were steadily going down. Then, all of a sudden, between 2020 and 2022, ten years of work [was] completely wiped out because of COVID-19.""
People with blood types A, B and AB were especially vulnerable to increased cardiovascular risk from COVID-19, while people with type O blood had a reduced chance of facing such issues, according to the study.
""Blood type is known to be associated with heart attack and stroke risk,"" said Allayee, who is a professor of population and public health sciences at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. ""If your blood type is A, B or AB, the virus is more likely to infect you and makes these blood cells open to viral entry.""
The study analyzed individuals from the UK Biobank, a large medical database consisting primarily of data taken from older, wealthier and predominantly white participants. However, similar studies looking at other populations came to nearly identical conclusions, according to Allayee.
The study emphasized the importance of COVID-19 vaccinations, Allayee said.
""No matter what vaccine you got, just six months after the vaccination or the booster, the chance of heart attack and stroke went down,"" he said. ""But immunity wanes over time, which is why you need the boosters. If not, you could be susceptible to getting severe COVID again.""
Anyone who has ever had a severe COVID-19 infection, especially if they required a hospital stay, should discuss the potentially increased health hazards caused by the virus with their health care provider, Allayee stressed.
""Talk to your doctor and start the discussion with your physician,"" he said. ""It's not going away, so we have to start talking about it. Stay on top of your vaccinations and boosters and get regular check-ups.""
Mahir Qureshi, M.D. is an internal medicine physician resident at Cooper University Hospital and a member of the ABC Medical Unit."

The fabricated effects of climate change are being tied to so-called human rights in law cases across the world. Legal precedents are being set. They may pretend it is to “save the world” but the real target is our rights and freedoms.
Let’s not lose touch…Your Government and Big Tech are actively trying to censor the information reported by The Exposé to serve their own needs. Subscribe now to make sure you receive the latest uncensored news in your inbox…
On 29 March, the United Nations General Assembly (“UNGA”) adopted the resolution A/77/L.58 requesting an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (“ICJ”) on the obligations of countries that are members of the United Nations (“UN”) regarding climate change.
Part of the request relates to the human rights implications of climate change. It references to international human rights instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
Commenting on the recent decision of the European Court of Human Rights in favour of a small group of elderly Swiss women who were backed by Greenpeace, the Off Guardian offered an explanation of why climate change is being linked to human rights.
By tying climate change to human rights, governments can justify enforcing increasingly strict climate change policies while simultaneously making it appear that the judiciary is forcing their hand.
Now they can effectively claim “You’ve got to switch to an electric car, or you’re infringing other people’s human rights”, but also, “don’t blame us our hands are tied by judges.”
It also enables a propaganda campaign of escalating divisive language, mirroring the vaccinated vs unvaccinated messaging during the “pandemic.”
Remember how we were told, “The unvaccinated are filling ICUs and making another lockdown more likely”? Well, in the future, that will become “climate change deniers are violating your human rights by refusing to use a smart meter.”Climate Change Court Cases are on the rise. Here’s why, Off Guardian, 11 April 2024
It must be remembered that human rights are bestowed by governments and, increasingly, supranational organisations. Human rights are changeable and can be changed by those who believe they have the authority to write the rules for mankind to follow. Inalienable rights or, if you prefer the older spelling, unalienable rights cannot be changed, transferred, removed or denied by man.
In the video below, Makia Freeman highlights the growing trend of legal cases to link climate change to human rights. In the description below his video on Rumble or Bitchute, he has included links to the articles he discussed.

4292,real,GENDER_BASED_DISINFORMATION,2024-07-09,"WHO Wants Brazil to Allow Infanticide
On May 17, 2024, Deputy Sóstenes Cavalcante, a member of Brazil’s House of Deputies, submitted bill #1904/2024, seeking to stop the barbarity of late-term abortions in the country. The legislation penalizes doctors who perform abortions after the fifth month of pregnancy (22 weeks) with the same penalties as homicide. The logic is simple: killing a child who could already live outside her mother’s womb constitutes true infanticide.
Sóstenes Cavalcante’s bill aims to confront the pro-abortion escalation advocated by the government of President Lula da Silva, which recently adopted the “International Classification of Diseases” published by the World Health Organization (WHO). That document expands the definition of abortion to include infanticide.
Currently, the Public Ministry permits doctors to perform abortions in cases of rape through all nine months of pregnancy.
The debate in the House of Representatives on PL 1904/2024 is underway, and the government is already signaling significant opposition.
Until 2022, the WHO followed the doctrine and medical practice that defined abortion as “removing a non-viable fetus from the mother’s womb.” Regardless of its morality or legality, that was the definition. But in 2022, the WHO’s 11th International Classification of Diseases – ICD-1– came into effect. That document, which the WHO updates every ten years, redefined abortion to mean “the expulsion of the fetus, regardless of the stage of pregnancy, through the intentional interruption of pregnancy, without the intention of producing a live birth.” Note that in this second WHO definition, the viability limit, estimated at 22 weeks of pregnancy, is removed, and the scope of “abortion,” induced and intentional, extends until the moment of birth.
REACH PRO-LIFE PEOPLE WORLDWIDE! Advertise with LifeNews to reach hundreds of thousands of pro-life readers every week. Contact us today.
Thus, suddenly, without much fanfare and in the shadow of the WHO procedures for drafting these documents, what was previously understood as infanticide is now understood as abortion.
With this semantic change, they no longer needed to change any law but could simply apply the old law with a new interpretation. In this way, laws that allow abortion up to the fifth month of pregnancy can now be understood and applied up to the moment of birth. And it was no accident. Given that the proposal that abortion is a human right is already being pushed globally, the WHO’s effort now claims that this “right” includes killing a baby at any point in the pregnancy.
Based on this new definition, Brazil’s Public Ministry began to demand, under the threat of legal action, that doctors perform abortions in cases of rape. Currently, Brazilian laws do not punish abortion due to rape.
Of course, this harmful influence is not limited to Brazil. It constitutes just one more imposition by the WHO on all countries despite all of the organization’s errors and excesses committed during the COVID pandemic under the pretext of “global public health.”
Before 2022, even left-wing governments like the first Lula Da Silva government (2003-2011) or that of Dilma Rousseff (2011-2016) prohibited killing unborn children by interrupting the pregnancy after viability. A rape victim or a woman with some obstetric complication did not need to continue the pregnancy after 22 weeks because, at that stage of gestation, the baby’s life is already viable outside the mother’s womb.
Therefore, after the 22nd week of pregnancy, when there is already the possibility of extrauterine life, removing a baby from the mother’s womb was not considered an abortion before 2022. If the baby’s life was saved, it was a premature birth. If it was to kill the baby, it was infanticide. It was for this reason, among others, that the “Technical Norms for Abortion in Case of Violence” of the Brazilian Ministry of Health prohibited performing abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy because it was no longer an abortion. The law does not punish abortion in case of rape, but after the baby is viable, it is homicide.
Sóstenes Cavalcante’s PL 1904/2024 is designed to prevent this macabre advance of late-term abortions in Brazil: such procedures are actually infanticides.
Can these late-term abortions be equated with homicide? The answer is yes, and the reasoning is simple.
- Is a baby that can survive outside the womb a human being? Yes.
- Is killing a human being a homicide? Yes. It is the very definition of homicide. Homicide means = hominis occisio = killing a man.
- Therefore, killing a baby that can survive outside the womb is homicide.
Detractors of PL 1904 have once again resorted to the narrative “anti-abortion = anti-woman,” based on the assertion that a raped woman (who aborts a viable child) would suffer a more severe penalty than the rapist does. That facile argument ignores PL 1904’s stipulation that the judge can examine each case and is empowered to considerably reduce the woman’s sentence or even eliminate it.
After all, in most of these cases, the woman is vulnerable due to her desperation, an extenuating circumstance that does not apply to the doctor. In reality, abortion advocates don’t protect the woman – she is, in fact, the second victim of abortion.
No, they protect the abortion industry and its operators.
What PL 1904 proposes does not restrict in any way what the current law permits. Rather, it opposes the gruesome escalation of the law on abortion that has prevailed in Brazil since 1989.
And today, homicide advocates can claim WHO as their ally.
If you believe we should stop this nefarious influence of the WHO, you can join the citizen petition initiated by the Population Research Institute for the United States, the main contributor to the WHO, to withdraw its funding.

5227,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-09-18,"The European Union's top diplomat has called on Georgia to scrap legislation approved by lawmakers that curbs LGBT rights and allows for bans on cultural events such as Pride marches.
The so-called Family Values bill was pushed through parliament by the ruling Georgian Dream party on September 17. Opposition members boycotted the vote and protesters rallied against it outside parliament, underscoring the dramatically polarized political landscape in the Caucasus nation ahead of national elections in October.
""The Georgian Parliament adopted laws on 'family values and protection of minors’ which will undermine the fundamental rights of the people and increase discrimination & stigmatization,""Josep Borrell, the high representative of the EU for foreign affairs, wrote in a post on X on September 18.
""I call on Georgia to withdraw this legislation, further derailing the country from its EU path.""
The package of legal changes, which came under the title On Family Values And Protection Of Minors, amends 18 current laws, including on free speech and expression, as well as broadcasting.
It allows for bans on gatherings that promote the notion of a person identifying as a gender other than ""his or her biological sex"" or same-sex orientation or relationships.
The initiative passed by a vote of 84-0 in a chamber that most of the opposition has boycotted since May.
That's when Georgian Dream lawmakers approved a ""foreign influence"" bill that Georgians and Western governments liken to the decade-old ""foreign agent"" law used by Russian authorities to clamp down on dissent with broad discretion.
They ended up overriding a presidential veto of the legislation to enact it.
The United States and other Western states have expressed concern about the law, which requires organizations that receive more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad to register as ""agents of foreign influence.""
On September 16, the United States slapped sanctions on more than 60 Georgians, including two members of the government, who it said had ""undermined"" democracy and human rights in the country.
Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze met on September 17 with U.S. Ambassador Robin Dunnigan and warned that Georgia might revise ties with the United States in response to the new sanctions.
""If one more such step is taken, this might lead to a revision of Georgia's stance on U.S.-Georgian relations,"" Kobakhidze said in the meeting with Dunnigan, according to a statement by the prime minister's office.
Tens of thousands of Georgians demonstrated against the bill despite a brutal crackdown and violent retaliation. Most protesters referred to the bill as ""the Russian law"" because of its similarity to decade-old legislation in Russia that has contributed to a fierce clampdown on independent media and public dissent there.
The European Union reacted to the enactment of the bill by pausing EU accession negotiations, while the United States opted to launch a ""comprehensive review"" of relations with Georgia.
In setting election day for October 26, Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili called the vote a choice between ""being Russia's slave or cooperation with Europe.""
Opinion polls show that Georgian Dream remains the country's single most popular party ahead of the election."
2458,real,INSTITUTIONAL_AND_MEDIA_DISTRUST_PUBLIC_INSTITUTIONS,2024-06-10,"France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has been accused of gambling with French democracy after announcing that he will dissolve parliament and call snap legislative elections in the wake of his allies’ crushing defeat to Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally (RN) in Sunday’s European parliament elections.
On a night that saw far-right parties make significant but far from conclusive gains in Europe, the RN won about 32% of French votes, more than double the 15% or so scored by Macron’s allies, according to projections, with the Socialists just behind on about 14%.
The first round of elections for the national assembly will take place on 30 June and the second on 7 July, Macron announced in an address to the nation, in a huge gamble on his political future three years before the end of his second term as president.
The outcome of the European parliament elections was “not a good result for parties who defend Europe”, the French president said, noting that, led by RN, far-right parties in France had taken almost 40% of the national vote.
“I cannot act as if nothing had happened,” he said. “I have decided to give you the choice ... Therefore I will dissolve the National Assembly tonight.” He said the decision was “serious and heavy”, but called it “an act of confidence”.
Less than two months before the start of the 2024 Paris summer Olympic Games, Macron said he had confidence in “the capacity of the French people to make the best choice for themselves and for future generations”.
He added: “This is an essential time for clarification. I have heard your message, your concerns, and I will not leave them unanswered … France needs a clear majority to act in serenity and harmony.”
Others were less convinced. Raphaël Glucksmann, who headed the Socialist party’s list, said Macron had “given in” to Jordan Bardella, 28, the RN’s lead candidate for the European elections. “This is a very dangerous game to play with democracy and the institutions. I am flabbergasted.”
Another critic, Valérie Pécresse, a senior figure in the conservative Les Républicains party, said: “Dissolving without giving anyone time to organise and without any campaign is playing Russian roulette with the country’s destiny.”
The daily newspaper Liberation wrote in its front-page headline on Monday: “The extreme gamble”.
“Emmanuel Macron is a poker player, we’ve seen that tonight,” said a Green party MP, Sandrine Rousseau. But Marine Le Pen, the RN figurehead who is seen as the frontrunner in 2027 presidential elections in which Macron cannot stand, said she welcomed the decision.
“We are ready to put the country back on its feet. We are ready to defend the interests of the French people,” she said. Bardella said voters had delivered a “stinging rejection” of the president.
Macron’s Renaissance party currently has 169 deputies in the national assembly, and the RN 88. If the far-right party wins an outright majority in the upcoming election, the president would effectively lose control over most French domestic policy.
Analysts have said that is unlikely, however, partly because European elections are often seen by voters as a cost-free way of delivering a kick to the incumbent government and things may well turn out differently in a parliamentary election.
With turnout in the European elections projected in France at just over 52%, Macron will be hoping to attract the voters who stayed at home to block the far right and possibly recover the absolute majority his party lost in 2022 legislative elections.
An RN victory would probably see Bardella appointed prime minister. Perhaps the most likely scenario, analysts said, was an anti-extremism coalition between Macron’s centrists and the traditional rightwing Republicans or even leftwing Socialists.
Céline Bracq, director general of the Odoxa polling agency, described the president’s announcement as a “poker move” at a time when there was a “strong desire among the French to punish the president”.
Luc Rouban, a political scientist at Sciences Po in Paris, said Macron wanted to “trap” the RN with his sudden election announcement, arguing that the far-right party would have trouble mustering quality candidates to challenge for the assembly’s 577 seats.
But Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group, told Agence-France Presse: “It’s obviously a major gamble. This is really Macron trying to seize the initiative. The most likely outcome is more fragmentation, more deadlock and chaos.”
While the far-right triggered a political earthquake in France and made major gains elsewhere, their progress was not universal, and mainstream parties looked set to keep a majority in the 27-member bloc’s parliament.
In Germany, the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) jumped to 14.2% from 11% in 2019, despite a slew of scandals, while chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democratic party slid to 14.6%, worse than its weakest ever result, in 2019. However, the The Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union, now in opposition, took a decisive lead, with 30.9% of the vote, according to provisional results.
The AfD’s success came despite a slew of scandals, including its lead candidate saying that the SS, the Nazi’s main paramilitary force, were “not all criminals”.
In Austria, meanwhile, the far-right Freedom party came top, with 25.7%, ahead of the conservative People’s party and the Social Democrats, on 24.7% and 23.2% respectively.
In the Netherlands, Geert Wilders’ far-right party was second behind a Left-Green alliance, but appeared to have fallen short of expectations. The Freedom party took 17% of the vote, while the Left-Green alliance, led by the former EU Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans, was on 21.1%.
But it was far from a clean sweep for the far right, which fell short of expectations in Belgium. And crucially, parties on the extreme right remain divided, making them less influential in Brussels."

ARSAL, Lebanon (AP) — More than 300 Syrian refugees headed back home to Syria in a convoy on Tuesday, leaving two remote northeastern towns in crisis-stricken Lebanon where anti-refugee sentiment has been surging in recent months.
Lebanese officials have long urged the international community to either resettle the refugees in other countries or help them return to Syria. Over the past months, leading Lebanese political parties have become increasingly vocal, demanding that Syrian refugees go back.
A country of about 6 million people, Lebanon hosts nearly 780,000 registered Syrian refugees and hundreds of thousands who are unregistered — the world’s highest refugee population per capita.
In the northeastern town of Arsal, Syrian refugees piled their belongings onto the back of trucks and cars on Tuesday as Lebanese security officers collected their U.N. refugee agency cards and other paperwork before clearing them to leave.
As the trucks pulled away, the refugees waved to friends and relatives staying behind, heading to an uncertain future in Syria.
Ahmad al-Rifai, on his way to the Qalamoun Mountains after over a decade in Lebanon, said that whatever the situation was in Syria, “it’s better to live in a house than in a tent.”
Lebanese security forces this year stepped up deportations of Syrians, although nowhere near the level threatened two years ago when the Lebanese government announced a plan to deport some 15,000 Syrians every month, to what they dubbed “ safe areas,” in cooperation with the government in Damascus.
Tuesday’s convoy from the mountainous towns of Arsal and Qaa consisted of only 330 refugees who had signed up for repatriation, the first such “voluntary return” return organized by Lebanese security forces since late 2022.
“Nobody can not be happy to return to their home,” Ahmad Durro told The Associated Press while waiting in his truck. “I signed up a year ago to be in the convoy.”
But many other Syrians — especially young men facing compulsory military service or political opponents of the government of President Bashar Assad — say it’s unsafe to return.
Others see no future in Syria, where in many parts the fighting may have died down but an economic crisis has pulled millions into poverty.
An increasing number of refugees in Lebanon have taken to the sea in an attempt to reach Europe.
The UNHCR has said it only supports voluntary returns of Syrians based on informed consent. Yet, major human rights organizations remain skeptical of the voluntary nature of these returns amid anti-refugee hostility in Lebanon.
“Syrian refugees are, targeted by both geo sources and host communities. They are subjected to violence, insults and other degrading treatment,” Amnesty International’s deputy Middle East and North Africa Regional Director Aya Majzoub told the AP, also decrying curfews and other restrictions imposed on refugees by a handful of Lebanese municipalities.
“So our assessment is that in these conditions, it is very difficult for refugees to make free and informed decisions about returning to Syria.”
Amnesty International and other human rights organizations have documented cases of refugees detained and tortured by Syrian security agencies upon their return.
The UNHCR says nine out of 10 Syrian refugees in Lebanon live in extreme poverty and need humanitarian aid to survive. That aid has declined amid donor fatigue and as international attention shifted to other crises.
Many increasingly impoverished Lebanese have accused Syrian refugees of benefitting from the aid while beating Lebanese to jobs by accepting lower pay. Lebanon’s ruling political parties and leadership claim that most Syrians living in the tiny Mediterranean country are economic migrants rather than refugees escaping the war at home, now in its 13th year. Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group, a top ally of Assad, has made such an allegation.
“They have dollars and they are sending those dollars to relatives in Syria,” Nasrallah said in a speech on Monday.
Lebanese security agents have in the past weeks raided shops and other businesses employing undocumented Syrian workers, and shut them down.
The European Union this month announced an aid package worth 1 billion euros — about $1.06 billion — of which about 200 million euros would go to security and border control, in an apparent bid to curb migration from Lebanon to Cyprus, Italy, and other parts of Europe.
While Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati welcomed the aid, other officials described it as a bribe for tiny Lebanon to keep the refugees.
Parliament is to discuss the EU package on Wednesday, with lawmakers from the entire political spectrum expected to ramp up anti-refugee sentiment and call for more refugee returns and crackdowns.

Chehayeb reported from Beirut."
5816,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-10-08,"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban -- who has been assailed by the West for his often Russian-friendly stance -- has suggested that Ukraine cannot win its war with Russia and pressed again for negotiations, even as a Hungarian opposition figure disrupted his news conference at the European Parliament.
""We don't want to block anything. We just want to convince European leaders to change their strategy [regarding Ukraine] because the current strategy does not work,"" Orban told reporters on October 8.
""If you cannot win on the battlefield -- you have to communicate, you have to negotiate, you have to have a cease-fire.""
Orban is in Strasbourg to address the parliament on October 9 to mark Central European country's six-month stint in the rotating EU presidency.
The populist Orban government has maintained ties with Moscow despite Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Orban has opposed aid to Kyiv and also angered the EU with his increasingly authoritarian rule and for his ties to China.
Marton Gyekiczki, an activist and city councilor for Hungary’s opposition Democratic Coalition (DK), interrupted Orban's news conference, tossing a stack of what appeared to be banknotes at the prime minister.
""How much did you sell out the country for? How much have you betrayed the country for, Mr. Prime Minister?” Gyekiczki shouted.
“He sold out to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. He sold out to [Chinese leader] Xi Jinping!”
A video posted online showed Gyekiczki approaching Orban before he was escorted out of the hall.
Shortly before Orban's press conference, the parliament's rapporteur on the situation in Hungary and the rule of law, Tineke Strik of the Netherlands, told reporters ""what Orban will not say in his speech tomorrow.""
Orban ""will present himself as a competent and strong Council [of the EU] presidency, an honest broker even,"" Strik said ""But he will stay silent about the corruption, the total state capture, his 24-hour propaganda machinery, and his authoritarian chokehold on virtual every aspect of Hungarian society.""
Orban also told reporters that U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump -- if elected – would immediately start working on a peace deal for Ukraine, not waiting until his January 20 inauguration, and that EU leaders would need to be prepared.
By law and tradition, newly elected U.S. presidents do not engage in setting government policies prior to taking office.
Orban has long endorsed Trump, who critics say would attempt to force Ukraine into agreeing to terms with Russia that have been unacceptable to Kyiv."
2941,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-03-27,"In a strange twist, global warming could even help out timekeepers by delaying the need for history's first ""negative leap second"" by three years, a study published on Wednesday suggested.
Experts fear that introducing a negative leap second -- a minute with only 59 seconds -- into standard time could cause havoc on computer systems across the world.
For most of history, time was measured by the rotation of the Earth. However in 1967, the world's timekeepers embraced atomic clocks -- which use the frequency of atoms as their tick-tock -- ushering in a more precise era of timekeeping.
But sailors, who still relied on the Sun and stars for navigation, and others wanted to retain the connection between Earth's rotation and time.
There was a problem. Our planet is an unreliable clock, and had long been rotating slightly slower than atomic time, meaning the two measurements were out of sync.
So a compromise was struck. Whenever the difference between the two measurements approached 0.9 of a second, a ""leap second"" was added to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), the internationally agreed standard by which the world sets its clocks.
Though most people likely have not noticed, 27 leap seconds have been added to UTC since 1972, the last coming in 2016.
But in recent years a new problem has emerged that few saw coming: Earth's rotation has been speeding up, overtaking atomic time.
This means that to bring the two measurements in sync, timekeepers may have to introduce the first ever negative leap second.
Our unpredictable planet
""This has never happened before, and poses a major challenge to making sure that all parts of the global timing infrastructure show the same time,"" said Duncan Agnew, a researcher at the University of California, San Diego.
""Many computer programs for leap seconds assume they are all positive, so these would have to be rewritten,"" he told AFP.
Partly using satellite data, Agnew looked at the rate of the Earth's rotation and the effect of its slowing core for the new study published in the journal Nature.
He determined that if not for climate change, a negative leap second might have needed to be added to UTC as soon as 2026.
But starting from 1990, melting ice in Greenland and Antarctica has slowed down the Earth's rotation, the study said. This has delayed the need for a negative leap second until at least 2029, it added.
""When the ice melts, the water spreads out over the whole ocean; this increases the moment of inertia, which slows the Earth down,"" Agnew said.
If the need for an ""unprecedented"" negative leap second was delayed, that would be ""welcome news indeed,"" Patrizia Tavella, the head of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, which is responsible for UTC, commented in Nature.
Demetrios Matsakis, former chief scientist for time services at the US Naval Observatory who was not involved in the research, told AFP that he was sceptical of Agnew's analysis.
He said that ""Earth is too unpredictable to be sure"" if a negative leap second would be needed any time soon.
Second nature
But all agreed that a negative leap second would be a hop into the unknown.
""It would not bring about the downfall of civilisation, and given enough publicity some problems could be avoided,"" Matsakis said.
""But I would not recommend being in an airplane at that time.""
Even positive leap seconds have previously caused problems for systems that require precise timekeeping.
That is partly why the world's timekeepers agreed in 2022 to scrap the leap second by 2035.
From that year, the plan is to allow the difference between atomic time and the Earth's rotation to grow up to a minute.
A subsequent leap minute to bring them into sync is not expected to be needed in the next century.
And ""a negative leap minute is very, very unlikely,"" Agnew said.
He hopes his research will prompt the world's timekeepers to consider dropping the leap second sooner than 2035, a sentiment echoed by Tavella and Matsakis.

2439,fake,INSTITUTIONAL_AND_MEDIA_DISTRUST_PUBLIC_INSTITUTIONS,2024-04-29,"Americans stand just weeks away from handing over massive amounts of taxpayer funding, protective equipment intended for U.S. citizens, and an incalculable amount of influence over U.S. policy to the World Health Organization (WHO), critics warn.
The global governance body will resume meetings to revise the WHO Pandemic Agreement on Monday. The Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB), established to draw up the text of the agreement in December 2021, will hold its ninth meeting from April 29 to May 10. That provides just over two weeks before the 77th World Health Assembly meets from May 27 to June 1 in Geneva, Switzerland, to ratify the final document.
The most recently updated version of the “Proposal for the WHO Pandemic Agreement,” amended on April 22, would redistribute wealth and protective equipment away from the U.S., establish a global governing board with little accountability to U.S. citizens and, critics say, water down U.S. sovereignty over how it responds to future pandemics.
The latest version of the agreement calls on nations to adopt “whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches” to pandemics, “including the private sector and civil society.” Governments should carry out so-called education programs that will suppress competing narratives about the pandemic, as the U.S. government did during COVID-19. Nations must also conduct research to determine what forces “hinder or strengthen adherence to public health and social measures in a pandemic,” such as mask and vaccine mandates.
WHO makes clear it intends to involve itself far beyond the physical aspects of the outbreak. The latest agreement invokes the “public health impact of growing threats such as climate change, poverty and hunger.” Fighting pandemics, it states, requires nations to “achieve greater health equity” by taking “resolute action on the social, environmental, cultural, political and economic determinants of health.”
This includes adopting a controversial “OneHealth” approach, which attempts to “balance” the “health of people, animals and ecosystems” as though all were equally valuable.
Nations have the right to “adopt legislation” only “in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, the WHO Constitution and the principles of international law, and their sovereign rights over their biological resources.” They also may not make reservations that are “incompatible with the object and purpose of the WHO Pandemic Agreement,” as determined by the WHO.
Aside from incursions onto national prerogatives spelled out in the WHO Pandemic Agreement, the document establishes a “Conference of the Parties,” a group of unelected officials empowered to adopt new resolutions that will be legally binding upon signatories.
The text makes the WHO pandemic arrangement easy to get into but hard to leave. Once a nation signs onto the accord, it “shall not be discharged” from any “obligations which accrued while it was a Party to the WHO Pandemic Agreement,” even after it withdraws.
The controversial document mandates that all nations assure “real-time access by WHO to 20%” of all “products that are needed for pandemic prevention, preparedness and response”: “10% as a donation” and 10% at “affordable prices.: WHO, in turn, will create “a mechanism to ensure the fair and equitable allocation and distribution of the pandemic-related health products” globally. Nations will agree to “prioritize sharing through” the WHO’s newly-established “Global Supply Chain and Logistics Network … over bilateral donation agreements” adopted with allied nations.
Every nation “shall” also create a “global health emergency workforce deployable to support [other signatories] upon request” of WHO.
State-to-state foreign aid amounts to wealth transfers to “up-and-coming young oligarchs in smaller nations,” journalist Jim Roguski told “Washington Watch with Tony Perkins” on Wednesday. As a result, wealthy nations will “put a lot of money into building out the pharmaceutical hospital emergency industrial complex in poor nations — not to give that money or support to poor people in poor nations, but to give it to wealthy people in poor nations so that they can jab them the next time around.”
Family Research Council has concluded that the WHO Pandemic Agreement puts in place the beginnings of “a turnkey totalitarian state.” FRC’s official comment filed with the U.S. government warns the WHO Pandemic Agreement, as written, “could authorize funding and support for abortion.” The agreement obligates nations to assure the provision of “essential health care services during pandemics,” and critics say, abortion can be held up as an essential service.
Observers warned readers against viewing the newest text as a modestly less intrusive document than some previous versions. “In desperation, watered-down versions of the proposed international health regulations and pandemic treaty were floated over the past few days. Don’t be fooled! The WHO still wants experimental vaccines rolled out, still wants liability shields, still wants to impose censorship, and still plans to use ‘One Health’ to control humans, plants, animals, and ecosystems, all in the name of health,” said independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Thursday.
The undemocratic mechanisms written into the agreement did not surprise Roguski. “Back in 2022, they pretended to adopt amendments to five articles, but they never bothered to vote” on them. Yet, despite the lack of a vote, those amendments will take force on May 31, he said.
“The good news is that they are having a difficult time,” Roguski told Perkins, breaking out high-pressure sales tactics for nations to sign onto the accord.
“Pressure to act swiftly or risk missing out on the treaty’s promise effectively warns LMICs [Low- and Middle-Income Countries] that this is their sole opportunity, insisting they must conform to the timeline,” wrote Sarah Hodges, professor of Global Health and Social Medicine at King’s College London. “However, this rapid pace raises concerns about what we refer to as ‘time equity’ –– the fair allocation of time and resources for deliberation and decision-making among all stakeholders.”
WHO officials are also pumping up fear about deadly, but hypothetical, future outbreaks. Kate Bingham and Tim Hames of the WHO warn in a new book, “The Long Shot,” that a theoretical “Disease X” could become the next pandemic and wipe out 50 million people worldwide.
WHO has smeared its opponents as purveyors of misinformation and disinformation. In March, former U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown — who is now WHO ambassador for global health finance — insisted, “It is time for countries to expose fake news disinformation campaigns by conspiracy theorists to torpedo a much-needed accord.” Brown warned that “governments must work to disavow them with clear facts,” and doing so “will be a test of our ability as a global community to resist the fragmentation of our world and instead cooperate on global problems that need global solutions.”
The potential toll to privacy from a global pandemic order could be real and stigmatizing, Roguski contended. “They want paperwork that says you’ve been injected with some substance, and if you don’t meet those requirements, you are suddenly dangerous to your fellow man or woman,” Roguski said. Others around the world feared the impact of the WHO once emboldened to act with greater authority. “Once approved, the WHO will have total powers and control over matters to do with health [and] climate change,” said Kenyan politician Steve Mbogo. “The depopulation [a]genda is wide and clear.”
Despite the WHO’s claim to act as the global authority, newly published data prove that lockdowns worsened other health outcomes. WHO recently revealed the number of children vaccinated against other diseases, such as diphtheria, plummeted by six million between 2018 and 2021 and remained 2% lower than prepandemic levels in 2022.
“You’re in the battle of your life to crush this attempt” to erode “our sacred right to be in control of our own body, make our own health decisions,” said Roguski.
Because of the short time line, conservatives feel “a sense of urgency to bring awareness to the issue before the WHO meets,” Jenny Beth Martin of Tea Party Patriots told American Family News.
Advocates of U.S. sovereignty have introduced numerous avenues for Americans to oppose WHO’s usurpation of their unalienable rights.
Legislatively, Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) has introduced the WHO Withdrawal Act (H.R. 79), and Senator Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.) has introduced the No WHO Pandemic Preparedness Treaty Without Senate Approval Act.
The Biden administration allows Americans to send written comments to with the subject line, “Written Comment Re: Stakeholder Listening Session for WHA77.” The comment deadline is Friday, May 3, 2024. FRC has drawn up a model comment for those seeking additional guidance.
Roguski said Christians should not overlook one additional resource available to them: “Pray for the outcome that you desire, which is for these negotiations to fall apart and for a vote never to even happen.” Similarly, Senator Johnso told Perkins last week, “Pray for a Tower of Babel within the World Health Organization.”

3857,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-09-22,"The first case of a person to contract bird flu after no known contact with animals is raising questions about the possibility of human-to-human transmission and highlighting the complicated relationship between states and federal agencies in outbreak response.
An extensive investigation into the case of a patient in Missouri who was hospitalized on 22 August has revealed no links to animals, officials at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told reporters on Thursday.
Two contacts of the patient also fell ill around the same time, the agency revealed in a report the next day.
A health worker developed mild symptoms but tested negative for the flu. More troublingly, a household member also developed symptoms on the same day as the patient – but that person was not tested for the flu.
There’s a blood test to check for antibodies to H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza, that may be done as soon as 10 days after infection, but antibody testing has not started, CDC officials said on Thursday.
The patient with a confirmed infection responded to lengthy questionnaires on recent activities, such as doing yard work, having a bird feeder, keeping any pets at home, visiting agricultural fairs or petting zoos, eating undercooked meat, or drinking raw milk. Nothing raised alarm bells with officials about potential exposures.
“Thus far, epidemiologists have not found a clear source of exposure,” said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC.
“Missouri is working really hard to go deeper into the [epidemiology] to see if there are any unperceived exposures that are possible,” said Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.
Genomic sequencing revealed that the strain is related to the virus that probably began circulating among dairy cows late last year; the bovine-adapted variant has since spilled into other wild and domesticated animals, including birds and mammals.
The patient’s sample showed at least two mutations, including one that might make current vaccine candidates for H5N1 less effective.
Shah told reporters last Thursday there was no evidence of person-to-person transmission, calling the event a likely “one-off” case.
“None of the individuals that this individual came into contact with have developed any signs and symptoms,” Shah said on Thursday.
Yet last Friday, the CDC reported the other two symptomatic contacts, one of which was shared “subsequently” by Missouri.
The CDC has not been invited by Missouri to help with the investigation, although federal officials are in touch with the state via phone and video calls, Shah said.
The CDC has limited authority for state- and local-level compliance, and recent supreme court decisions may have a chilling effect on regulatory action.
Missouri has been in “very close consultation” with the CDC since detecting the case, “but we have not had a need for more extensive on-site assistance at this time as we are still limited to one case with low risk of sustained transmission”, Lisa Cox, communications director for the Missouri department of health and senior services, told the Guardian.
Only 240 people or so have been tested for H5N1 in the 2024 outbreak, according to the CDC. Typically, tests are done only when someone in close contact with infected animals develops symptoms.
In Missouri, that is not what happened. Health workers suspected a respiratory infection such as the seasonal influenza, but the swab was not fast-tracked as a potential H5N1 infection, Shah said. Instead, it was sent to the state laboratory with other flu A samples to be double-checked as part of routine surveillance looking for any types of unusual flu strains.
This kind of monitoring usually happens during the winter flu season, but in May the CDC recommended states continue monitoring flu A through the summer because of ongoing outbreaks on poultry and dairy farms.
This is the first time an H5N1 case has been detected using the national flu surveillance system.
“Our influenza surveillance system is designed to find needles in haystacks, and as this case and others show, it is working,” Shah said. “We found such a needle, but we don’t know how it got there.”
Missouri has not reported any cases of H5N1 in cows, but the state had only tested 17 of about 60,000 dairy cows as of July. The most recent outbreak of bird flu among Missouri poultry was reported in February.
There have not been any unusual levels of flu activity or emergency department visits in this area compared with last year’s levels, Shah said. “But our investigation is not over.”
The patient in Missouri, who has “significant” underlying conditions, experienced “acute” symptoms of chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and weakness, Shah said.
“The patient has underlying chronic medical conditions, and respiratory symptoms were not the leading cause for hospitalization on admission,” Cox said. The patient was not severely ill, was hospitalized for three days, and has recovered.
It is possible that the individual’s existing medical conditions made them more vulnerable to illness, Shah said.
As the virus continues to spread among animals, officials remain on alert for more cases among people, Shah said. “As more animal species exhibit and harbor H5, the possibility of animal-human interaction goes up, and thus the possibility of human cases goes up.”"
2527,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-07-23,"Continued Russian attacks on the energy grid have made Ukraine resort to taking massive amounts of power from neighbouring countries.
The hall of the largest thermal power plant in western Ukraine, the location of which is undisclosed because of security reasons, resembles a repair shop. Instead of supervising the units' operation, employees salvage every component that can still be used.
Before the war, it was one of the region's key power plants. Now it can only generate heat for the neighbouring village.
The Russian shelling is also putting enormous pressure on the entire energy network in Ukraine, as it is targeting not only production facilities but also, for example, substations and the power grid.
""The shelling of thermal power plants and larger nodal substations has a critical impact on the operation of the power system. Their goal is simple: no energy, no economy. They are making huge efforts to destroy the Ukrainian energy sector,"" said Serhey, production control officer at the thermal power plant.
Ukraine is, therefore, unable to smoothly transfer energy from the west to the east. Many high-voltage lines are being overloaded, and the authorities in the various regions are having to carry out shutdowns.
People are without power for several hours every day. Ukraine is having to take massive amounts of power from neighbouring countries. In the last month alone, it has imported more energy than the whole of last year.
Because of attacks on energy sources such as thermal power stations, gas is becoming increasingly important in the country, and not only as a source of heat. And that is why Ukrainians across the country are still searching for new gas deposits and putting more and more gas wells into operation.
Ahead of winter, the Ukrainian government is encouraging authorities and businesses to buy large gas generators, but without major investment in new networks, these will only help locally.
Borrell: More energy support for Ukraine needed
On the other hand, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said that the next foreign minister meeting will be in Brussels, not Budapest, as a symbol that member states are critical of Hungary's stance on Ukraine.
He added he asked ministers to provide more power generation capacities to Ukraine.
""Putin wants to put Ukraine into the darkness and the cold, and that is why the coming two or three months will be crucial, and we don't have time to wait before the winter arrives,"" Borrell stated.
""I asked ministers to start mobilising now to provide more power generation capacities to Ukraine, contributing to the Ukrainian Energy Support Fund, which is also needed."""
2139,fake,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-02-26,"What was once just another “conspiracy theory” was published on Sunday in the New York Times (NYT), where they have made a “very belated full admission that US intelligence has not only been instrumental in Ukraine wartime decision-making, but has established and financed high tech command-and-control spy centres, and was doing so long prior to the Feb. 24 Russian invasion of two years ago.”
This has been a secret for over a decade and as the NYT generally takes the role of the U.S. governments mouthpiece, a tool to steer public opinion towards the preferred narrative, this new report begs the question, why are they reporting this now? There has to be some agenda, doesn’t there?
Tyler Durden reports the story which was originally published in Zerohedge:
Among the biggest revelations is that the program was established a decade ago and spans three different American presidents. The Times says the CIA program to modernize Ukraine’s intelligence services has “transformed” the former Soviet state and its capabilities into “Washington’s most important intelligence partners against the Kremlin today.”
This has included the agency having secretly trained and equipped Ukrainian intelligence officers spanning back to just after the 2014 Maidan coup events, as well constructing a network of 12 secret bases along the Russian border—work which began eight years ago. These intelligence bases, from which Russian commanders’ communications can be swept up and Russian spy satellites monitored, are being used launch and track cross-border drone and missile attacks on Russian territory.
This means that with the disclosure of the long time “closely guarded secret” the world just got a big step closer to WW3, given it means the CIA is largely responsible for the effectiveness of the recent spate of attacks which have included direct drone hits on key oil refineries and energy infrastructure.
“Without them [the CIA and elite commandoes it’s trained], there would have been no way for us to resist the Russians, or to beat them,” according to Ivan Bakanov, former head of the SBU, which is Ukraine’s domestic intelligence agency.
A main source of the NYT revelations—disclosures which might come as no surprise to those never willing to so easily swallow the mainstream ‘official’ narrative of events—is identified as a top intelligence commander named Gen. Serhii Dvoretskiy.
Clearly, Kiev and Washington now want world to know of the deep intelligence relationship they tried to conceal for over the past decade. It is perhaps a kind of warning to Moscow at a moment Ukraine’s forces are in retreat: the US is fighting hand in glove with the Ukrainians. And yet the revelations contained in the NY Times report also confirm what President Putin has precisely accused Washington of all along.
While the lengthy NYT report is full of fresh revelations and confirmation of just how deeply the CIA has always been involved in Ukraine, below are seven of the biggest contained in the story…
Description of secret spy bunker
The report contains a surprisingly detailed description of one of the ‘secret’ underground command centers established by the CIA near the Russian border… location undisclosed of course:
Not far away, a discreet passageway descends to a subterranean bunker where teams of Ukrainian soldiers track Russian spy satellites and eavesdrop on conversations between Russian commanders. On one screen, a red line followed the route of an explosive drone threading through Russian air defenses from a point in central Ukraine to a target in the Russian city of Rostov.
The underground bunker, built to replace the destroyed command center in the months after Russia’s invasion, is a secret nerve center of Ukraine’s military.
There is also one more secret: The base is almost fully financed, and partly equipped, by the CIA.
Elite commando force
Within two years after the 2014 West-backed coup in Ukraine, the CIA had set up a training program for elite Ukrainian operatives:
Around 2016, the CIA began training an elite Ukrainian commando force — known as Unit 2245 — which captured Russian drones and communications gear so that CIA technicians could reverse-engineer them and crack Moscow’s encryption systems. (One officer in the unit was Kyrylo Budanov, now the general leading Ukraine’s military intelligence.)
And the CIA also helped train a new generation of Ukrainian spies who operated inside Russia, across Europe, and in Cuba and other places where the Russians have a large presence.
Ukraine transformed into an “intelligence-gathering hub”
The US intelligence network in Ukraine (which is tantamount to NATO intelligence network too) has in reality been more extensive than pretty much all prior media speculation has envisioned. Ukraine has long been a massive “intelligence gathering hub” for Washington and its partners:
In more than 200 interviews, current and former officials in Ukraine, the United States and Europe described a partnership that nearly foundered from mutual distrust before it steadily expanded, turning Ukraine into an intelligence-gathering hub that intercepted more Russian communications than the CIA station in Kyiv, Ukraine, could initially handle. Many of the officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence and matters of sensitive diplomacy.
Now these intelligence networks are more important than ever, as Russia is on the offensive and Ukraine is more dependent on sabotage and long-range missile strikes that require spies far behind enemy lines. And they are increasingly at risk: If Republicans in Congress end military funding to Kyiv, the CIA may have to scale back.
Huge NYT admission that Putin was basically right
Below is a hugely ironic excerpt from the Times report. The section begins by noting that Putin has repeatedly blamed the US-NATO for expanding its military and intelligence infrastructure into Ukraine. Not only had this precisely been going on for the past decade, as is now being admitted, but was presented by the Kremlin as a key cause of the Russian invasion of Feb.24, 2022. Putin and his officials were adamant on the eve of the invasion that NATO was militarizing Ukraine. The Times appears to now fully admit that, yes – this was actually the case:
Putin has long blamed Western intelligence agencies for manipulating Kyiv and sowing anti-Russia sentiment in Ukraine.
Toward the end of 2021, according to a senior European official, Putin was weighing whether to launch his full-scale invasion when he met with the head of one of Russia’s main spy services, who told him that the CIA, together with Britain’s MI6, were controlling Ukraine and turning it into a beachhead for operations against Moscow.
…U.S. officials were often reluctant to fully engage, fearing that Ukrainian officials could not be trusted, and worrying about provoking the Kremlin.Yet a tight circle of Ukrainian intelligence officials assiduously courted the CIA and gradually made themselves vital to the Americans. In 2015, Gen. Valeriy Kondratiuk, then Ukraine’s head of military intelligence, arrived at a meeting with the CIA’s deputy station chief and without warning handed over a stack of top-secret files.
2014 Coup… and Crimea
The report indirectly references this very critical period which set Ukraine and Russian on their tragic collision course:
With violence escalating, an unmarked U.S. government plane touched down at an airport in Kyiv carrying John Brennan, then the director of the CIA. He told Nalyvaichenko that the CIA was interested in developing a relationship but only at a pace the agency was comfortable with, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials.
To the CIA, the unknown question was how long Nalyvaichenko and the pro-Western government would be around. The CIA had been burned before in Ukraine.
…The result was a delicate balancing act. The CIA was supposed to strengthen Ukraine’s intelligence agencies without provoking the Russians. The red lines were never precisely clear, which created a persistent tension in the partnership.
Operation Goldfish
Money and advanced tech given by the CIA has allowed the Ukrainians to establish eavesdropping operations far beyond what they would otherwise be capable of. All the while, elite commando teams were being trained by the CIA in European cities as part of a program called ‘Operation Goldfish’. The NYT reporting includes a bit of a ‘boast’ of the Ukrainians now being able to hack into Russian military networks:
In the bunker, Dvoretskiy pointed to communications equipment and large computer servers, some of which were financed by the CIA. He said his teams were using the base to hack into the Russian military’s secure communications networks.
“This is the thing that breaks into satellites and decodes secret conversations,” Dvoretskiy told a Times journalist on a tour, adding that they were hacking into spy satellites from China and Belarus, too.
…The CIA began sending equipment in 2016, after the pivotal meeting at Scattergood, Dvoretskiy said, providing encrypted radios and devices for intercepting secret enemy communications.
A stunning admission: “Tiptoeing Around Trump”
Among the most interesting and curious moments of the NYT report is a description of the CIA program’s expanse under the Trump administration. The report suggests that the true scope may have even been hidden from Trump. The Russian hawks in his administration quietly did the ‘dirty work’, we are told:
The election of Trump in November 2016 put the Ukrainians and their CIA partners on edge.
Trump praised Putin and dismissed Russia’s role in election interference. He was suspicious of Ukraine and later tried to pressure its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to investigate his Democratic rival, Biden, resulting in Trump’s first impeachment.
The report then emphasizes, “But whatever Trump said and did, his administration often went in the other direction. This is because Trump had put Russia hawks in key positions, including Mike Pompeo as CIA director and John Bolton as national security adviser.”
And further, “They visited Kyiv to underline their full support for the secret partnership, which expanded to include more specialized training programs and the building of additional secret bases.” Given the attempt to place Trump in a negative light (he had to be ‘tiptoed around’…), it will be interesting to see how he and his campaign respond to the report. But more consequential will be the reaction of Putin and the Kremlin in the coming days.

6063,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-11-01,"Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said Bratislava is ready to join a proposal promoted by Brazil and China to resolve the war in Ukraine.
Fico met with Chinese President Xi Jinping on November 1 in Beijing and said afterward that China’s position on the war in Ukraine “is fair, objective, and constructive.""
RFE/RL's Ukraine Live Briefing gives you the latest developments on Russia's invasion, Western military aid, the plight of civilians, and territorial control maps. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.
China and Brazil in August jointly published a ""six-point consensus"" meant to bring about a lasting political solution to the war that Russia launched in February 2022. The plan calls for cooling down the fighting and a recognition that dialogue and negotiations are the only way to end the war.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called the proposal ""destructive"" and ""mostly pro-Russian"" as it calls for a compromise from Ukraine and was created without input from Kyiv.
He rejected it in an interview in September with Brazilian media, saying it has nothing to do with justice or with values and fails to take into account Ukraine’s position and the issue of territorial integrity.
Despite Zelenskiy's rejection of the plan, Fico said Slovakia is willing to join other countries that China says have positively received it “and work with China to contribute to promoting a political solution to the crisis,” according to a Chinese government statement.
Fico, who has criticized EU policies on Ukraine and has opposed sanctions on Russia, said Slovakia is “very keen on China’s diplomatic efforts dedicated to regulating the conflict in Ukraine and have exchanged our attitudes on this fundamental issue.”
China could play a ""decisive role"" regarding the Ukraine conflict, he added on Facebook.
China has been criticized by Western countries for maintaining friendly ties with Russia and for providing dual-use equipment such as electronics needed for weapons production.
Beijing has said that the plan it developed with Brazil, which it calls Friends Of Peace, has received a ""positive response"" from more than 110 countries.
Fico landed in Beijing on October 31 for a state visit set to end on November 5.
Slovakia and China announced on November 1 that the two countries had signed a strategic partnership agreement and granted Slovak citizens 15-day visa-free entry to China.
Xi said China would strengthen bilateral cooperation with Slovakia in areas such as new energy, transport and logistics, and infrastructure construction, according to the official Xinhua news agency."
2223,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-02-14,"""The Ukrainian Armed Forces, together with the Defence Ministry's intelligence unit, destroyed the large landing ship Tsezar Kunikov. It was in Ukrainian territorial waters near Alupka at the time of the hit,"" Ukraine’s military said on the Telegram messaging app.
The Ukrainska Pravda media outlet earlier Wednesday reported that sea drones hit and damaged a large Russian landing ship off occupied Crimea.
The news outlet published several videos showing a column of smoke off the southern coast of Crimea, as well as helicopters flying over the sea.
Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksiy Honcharenko said the targeted ship was Tsezar Kunikov, which took part in Russian military operations in Georgia in 2008.
In December, Ukrainian cruise missiles struck a large Russian landing warship in Crimea, killing at least one person.
Russian strikes kill three in Ukraine's Donetsk
The news came after Russian bombing raids killed three people including a child late Tuesday near Ukraine's eastern city of Donetsk, local authorities said.
The strikes hit nine apartment blocks and a hospital in Selydove, about 20 kilometres (12 miles) west of the front line, the local council said on Telegram.
Twelve people were also injured in the bombing, including four children, it added.
According to the governor of Donetsk region, Vadym Filachkine, the first strike took place at around 11:30pm (21:30 GMT) and the second at around 1am (23:00 GMT).
About 100 patients were evacuated from the damaged hospital to the nearby towns of Pokrovsk and Myrnograd, he added on Telegram.
No details were available about the type of strikes that were carried out.
Selydove, which had a population of around 21,000 before the war, is located on the outskirts of the large city of Donetsk, which has been occupied by Russia since 2014.
Two Ukrainian drones were intercepted overnight by Russian air defence over the Belgorod region, near the border with Ukraine, Russia's state news agency RIA Novosti reported citing the defence ministry.
Another drone was intercepted over the western region of Voronezh, and six others over the Black Sea, it added.

2273,real,ANTI_MIGRATION_AND_XENOPHOBIA,2024-03-06,"The European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, has given her support to controversial migration reforms that would involve deporting people to third countries for asylum processing and the imposition of a quota system for those receiving protection in EU countries.
Manfred Weber, the leader of the European People’s party (EPP), said the policies – similar to the UK’s Rwanda scheme – had been worked out with all the parties in the EPP political group, which includes von der Leyen’s Christian Democrat Union in Germany.
Warning that “the far right wants to destroy Europe from the inside”, Weber said the EPP would be “crystal clear” about its desire to reduce immigration in the campaign for the European elections in June.
Asked if von der Leyen – who is expected to be nominated as the EPP’s candidate for European Commission president at its annual congress in Romania – backed these policies, Weber said: “All the programmatic positions of the European People’s party are [supported] also by Ursula von der Leyen … We do this as a team together.
He added: “What European people expect from us – and here the European People’s party will be, in the campaign, crystal clear – you have to lower the numbers of arrivals. And we have to separate the visitors who are refugees and asylum seekers who should get the protection they need.”
The policy is seen as an initiative to head off the rise of far-right and extremist parties such as the AfD in Germany. It envisages the EU doing a series of deals with non-EU states with a view to deporting people who have arrived via irregular migration routes for asylum processing in those “safe” third countries.
The draft law advocating the fundamental change in European asylum regime will be considered at the EPP’s annual congress in Bucharest on Wednesday as part of the party’s manifesto discussions.
The hardening of migration policy is likely to inflame tensions within the parliament and create external political risks for von der Leyen, who must represent the interests of the entire EU and not one political bloc in parliament, where the EPP is the largest grouping.
She is expected to be formally selected as the EPP’s official candidate for the European Commission presidency in a vote in Romania on Thursday, meaning that it will back her for a second term in office.
One Brussels insider said “the socialists will go mad with this” – a reference to the Socialists and Democrats, the second-biggest voting bloc in the European parliament.
Sophie in ’t Veld, a Dutch MEP and the lead representative for the liberal Renew group on the parliament’s committee for civil liberties, justice and home affairs, called the measure “yet another unsavoury EPP chunk of red meat, meant to attract the far-right vote”.
She added: “It will not work. All the EPP strategy has achieved over the past years is making the far right bigger. So if they know it doesn’t work, why do they stubbornly repeat the same tactics each time?”
The EPP represents centre-right parties across Europe, including government parties in Greece, Poland, Ireland, Latvia, Croatia, Lithuania, Sweden, Romania, Finland and Luxembourg.
Its manifesto says: “We want to implement the concept of safe third countries. Anyone applying for asylum in the EU could also be transferred to a safe third country and undergo the asylum process there.” However, in what could be seen as an effort to set itself apart from the UK’s controversial Rwanda policy, the manifesto stresses that the “criteria for safe countries shall be in line with the core obligations of the Geneva refugee convention and the European convention on human rights”.
It says that neither of the conventions “include the right to freely choose the country of protection”.
Developing the theme further, it says that after the “implementation of the third country concept”, it proposes the EU then “admit a quota of people in need of protection through annual humanitarian quotas of vulnerable individuals”.
The publication of the manifesto and the launch of the EPP campaign could be start of a tricky period for von der Leyen. “I don’t think she will have any difficulty among member states, but the parliamentary vote is another game altogether,” said one diplomat.
While very little legislation is left to negotiate, the bumps on the road to June act as a reminder of how von der Leyen came to power in 2019 – as a last-minute compromise candidate who was voted in with a wafer-thin majority."
3790,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-01-18,"Speaking at Davos, EU health boss Stella Kyriakides warned of the need to draw up safeguards on AI-driven tools used in the health sector including keeping human oversight over processes.
From machine learning easing diagnoses to the discovery of innovative drugs, artificial intelligence (AI) promises to disrupt the healthcare sector in the near future.
The EU has started to look into the use of such cutting-edge solutions in the health sector, weighing both positive and more controversial developments of AI.
“I believe that we can have all the potential that AI offers us and have the guardrails in place,” EU Commissioner for Health Stella Kyriakides told a panel at the World Economic Forum 2024’s Davos summit (17 January).
The bloc’s attempt to regulate this emerging technology through its pioneering Artificial Intelligence Act should be seen in the context of establishing some safeguards, according to the Commissioner.
Another key regulatory framework designed to channel the AI revolution is the European Health Data Space (EHDS), presented by the EU Executive in 2022 and currently being discussed by lawmakers.
“So much health data is out there, we saw it with Covid. We need to be able to pull this data so it can be used for innovation and research,” she said.
Data and trust
This new legislation will enable patients to share health data including medical history, test results, and prescriptions with hospitals and practitioners across all member states.
Once the EU health data infrastructure is up and running, researchers, institutions, and industry should be able to deploy AI to combine these vast real-time data pools.
Despite its evident potential, Kyriakides warned that the EHDS project might foster mistrust since “health data is very, very sensitive” for citizens.
“If people do not trust the system, the EHDS is not going to be able to bring the results we would like it to bring,” she said in Davos.
To avoid this scenario, the Commission has put forward safeguards enabling patients to “fully control their own health data and be able to exercise their rights.”
“Patients will have the choice to control which data they want to share, with whom they want to share it, and also have the choice if they don't want to share some of their data for any reason,” she said.
Likewise, the anonymity of health data will be guaranteed when it is collected in the context of research, she added.
Human touch
Kyriakides told Euronews on the sidelines of the panel that she views maintaining “human control in the process” as a key safeguard.
“The outcome of an AI-enabled process for diagnosis or to make a treatment more precise must be explainable and understandable both to the doctor and the patient,” she continued.
Use of radiology in cancer detection offers a good example of such diagnoses, she said, citing a Cancer Imaging Initiative – a common digital infrastructure to link different databases of cancer images across the EU – launched by the European Commission at the beginning of 2023.
However, even if AI systems offer the potential to save a huge amount of time spent in analysing pictures, medical expertise is still ultimately required for assessments and decisions.
“[Through this initiative], it will be possible to train new technologies that use artificial intelligence on large datasets to make more precise and faster clinical decisions, which can improve diagnosis and personalised care,” Kyriakides said."
3901,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-09-24,"- A new study compares psilocybin — the active compound in magic mushrooms, with a common antidepressant medication.
- During 6 months of follow up, both drugs effectively improved depressive symptoms.
- Psilocybin, however, seemed to provide additional benefits, including improved psychological connectedness and social functioning.
- This is a small study, and scientists still need to conduct more research to understand the longterm effects of psilocybin.
Psilocybin is the active ingredient in magic mushrooms. In recent decades, the psychedelic compound has become a growing area of research for its potential mental health benefits.
A new study, published on September 21 in
The research is a 6-month follow-up to a previous study published in 2021. In that study, researchers found that two doses of psilocybin plus psychological support had a similar antidepressant effect as escitalopram taken daily for 6 weeks.
At the 6-month mark, the researchers noted that psilocybin had other psychological benefits compared with escitalopram. Namely, those in the psilocybin group were more likely to:
- function well at work and in society
- feel more psychologically connected
- find more meaning in life
This research is among the first to directly compare psilocybin on depression symptoms to standard treatment.
Still, despite being the largest of its kind to date, the study had only 59 participants. The authors explain their results should be “interpreted with caution,” and call for more research.
SSRIs are a common class of antidepressants and can be very effective, especially in combination with talk therapies.
However, SSRIs may not work for everyone. Importantly, people often need to take these drugs daily for many years to ensure they do not experience a relapse.
David Merrill, MD, a board-certified geriatric psychiatrist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, not involved in the new research, told Healthline that “escitalopram is one of the most widely prescribed drugs for depression currently available.”
Even so, SSRIs are associated with side effects, such as “sexual dysfunction, weight gain, fatigue, and emotional blunting,” the authors of the new study noted.
For these reasons, scientists must identify new approaches to treating depression. Some hope that psilocybin might help fill this gap.
Several small studies conclude that it may have a powerful antidepressant effect.
For instance, a preliminary
Similarly, a
Importantly, these studies identified few serious side effects, and rather than a daily dose, the treatment appears to be effective for weeks or months after just a single dose.
To date, few have compared psilocybin with standard antidepressants, which is where this new study comes in.
The study involved 59 participants with a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder. The researchers split them into two groups, who received either:
- Two 25-milligram oral doses of psilocybin combined with psychological support.
- A 6-week course of escitalopram plus the same level of psychological support as the psilocybin group.
At the 6-month mark, participants in both groups had sustained improvements in their depressive symptoms.
“While several studies have shown psilocybin’s potential to reduce depressive symptoms, this study’s strong and sustained effect for 6 months even after two doses is noteworthy,” Ozan Toy, MD, a neuropsychiatrist not involved in this study, told Healthline.
“The absence of severe side effects in a larger population size adds confidence to psilocybin’s safety profile,” Toy noted.
Compared with the escitalopram group, those who took psilocybin also reported improved:
- functioning at work and in social situations
- psychological connectedness with others
- sense that life has meaning
“It is surprising how psilocybin therapy led to significant long-term improvements in social functioning, psychological connectedness, and meaning in life compared with escitalopram,” explained board-certified psychiatrist Brook Choulet, MD, who was not involved in the study.
“Previous studies have shown shorter-term benefits, but this study suggests possible broader improvements,” Choulet told Healthline.
Neuroplasticity describes the brain’s ability to reorganize its networks in light of new information. It is essential for learning new skills and adapting to change, which can help with depression.
“Psilocybin interacts with serotonin receptors in the brain, particularly the 5-HT2A receptor,” Toy explained. “This interaction promotes neuroplasticity, allowing for a ‘reset’ of rigid thought patterns, which may help alleviate depressive symptoms.”
“Psilocybin also alters activity in brain regions linked to mood regulation and self-reflection, which can contribute to novel experiences such as ‘ego dissolution’ or ‘cognitive reappraisal’,” Toy continued.
An example of cognitive reappraisal is putting a positive spin on things or looking at a situation from another perspective. For instance, viewing poor exam results as an “opportunity to grow.”
Many people — experts and the public — are hopeful about the potential of psilocybin as a mental health treatment, but is this excitement justified?
“The excitement is justified, given psilocybin’s potential to treat resistant depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),” Toy said. “Many
Still, Toy added a word of caution: “Concerns remain about long-term effects, accessibility, and better safety data to understand the risks and benefits.”
As the evidence base for psilocybin grows, more research is still needed before the psychoactive compound can be rolled out to the public.
In the meantime, experts do not recommend self-treating depression with psilocybin at home. “Psychological support is crucial for ensuring safety, guiding the experience, and integrating insights gained,” Toy said.
“Without professional supervision, people may experience overwhelming emotions, anxiety, or bad trips that could exacerbate their mental health issues. It is proper that these powerful drugs are utilized in a controlled and safe environment,” he noted.
Choulet aded there are “concerns about inducing bad trips or distressing psychological experiences, so it’s important that there’s appropriate medical oversight. There’s also the possibility that it could induce psychosis,” she said.
Despite concerns around safety, Merrill shared that psilocybin may be useful in the future to treat depression and said the drug “helps us understand mechanisms of depression.”
Merrill added there may be “ways to achieve the benefits of psychedelics without the drugs.”
Holotropic breathing, for instance, may be helpful for depression, but Merrill noted “even that can be of an intensity such that it’s recommended to be tried only under the direct supervision of an experienced practitioner.”
Overall, Merrill said he hopes that psilocybin can be further investigated and eventually reach a larger audience.
“I would like to see more efforts to complete scientifically rigorous trials that can help legalize psilocybin and then achieve FDA approval for scheduled use of the drug in a controlled setting,” Merrill concluded.
A new study compares psilocybin with a common antidepressant. Both drugs successfully reduced depressive symptoms over 6 months, but psilocybin had additional mental health benefits.
Despite these promising findings, the study was relatively small, and more research is needed.
People living with depression should not self-treat with psilocybin. Professional supervision while taking psilocybin can help ensure safety and effectiveness."

Once a week, I plan to write something about our rapidly evolving culture, and once a week, I plan to deconstruct the malignancy of the environmental movement, which I believe is the primary driver of an impending economic catastrophe everyone sentient dreads. No one else is doing this work, in part because everyone who does is shut down. Here, at Substack, I think I am obscure enough to be able to drill down without someone auditing me, firing me, cancelling me or pulling a contract. I have deep connections among those fighting this fight, and my work will be well informed. As before, I have stellar training and have written for almost every great publisher in the US, UK and Canada.

Ever asked yourself why six million have poured through the Southern border in the last 8 months? Oh, I know, in search of economic freedom, oppression by their home governments, or oligarchs, drugs, death squads, crime etc. Same with Africa. But again, why do they risk so much to leave homelands that almost certainly, most of them love. The idea of ‘place’ is not an idea, it is a deep attachment, physical, emotional and sensate that trumps reason. You have to kill a lot of your natural self to leave, to risk your life and that of your children to escape to the cold grey north and never return. The fear alone would overwhelm all but the strongest.
They are leaving because they must.
But why now? It’s been bad forever. In South and Central America, between the descendants of the Conquistadors and the Commies, everyone has been ground beneath the heel of the oppressor for 20 generations. Because activist charities pay for these long trains of migrants? Because the left in Europe and Democrats have declared the border open?
No. Well yes, and no, those latter are just the mechanisms. And they have been deliberately constructed.
Mostly they are coming because Black Rock1, the UN, the WEF are grabbing their lands, the more fertile the better, driving them from those lands and sticking them into tenement cities where they have to scratch like chickens for a living. Agenda 2030 is ravening under the radar in the US and Canada, where “civil society” in the pay of the government and environmental NGOs funded by oligarchs, is taking as much land and as many resources as possible out of the productive economy and shoving it into the land banks of BlackRock.
In the south, it’s not surreptitious. It is state policy to destroy their lives, to take their ancestral lands, whether it’s 40 acres or a half acre and leave them begging by the side of the road.

Climate Change is a complex financial mechanism which under the guise of “saving the planet”, is meant to save the predator class.
Which is not only morally bankrupt, but is dealing with a level of government and corporate debt that they know they cannot sustain. In the healthiest economy in the world, the US, all profits now are coming from either some mechanism of government subsidy – the $6 Trillion of the Covid catastrophe – or Collateralized Default Obligations2. For instance right now Penguin is in court attempting to buy Random House. Why? Because they can borrow money to do that, buy back some of their stock and pay their shareholders. It will mean middle managers will lose their jobs, and marginal books will not be published, but the ravening maw of Jamie Diamond and Larry Fink will be satiated. For the moment. There is no other reason. Growth, real growth has stalled in every single enterprise.
This is how it works at the top of the class pyramid:
Last week on my island we were treated to the spectacle of well-heeled, highly educated, well-spoken older men and women arguing that the impoverished elderly, the young, and families starting out should not have housing because of climate change. Our island is 74 square miles with 10,000 residents. That means we have one resident per five acres.
Our government, the trust, had proposed the use of accessory buildings, brought up to code, for long-term rentals.
The extreme form of land conservation we practice has meant that housing prices have skyrocketed, so only the rich and the well-pensioned can afford to live here. A thousand or so working age people manage to make a living, generally via remote work. We have no staff for the schools, hospitals, businesses, restaurants. They cannot afford to live here.
About 200 people on our islands, mostly in their 70s and 80s, tightly aligned with the hysterical wing of the environmental movement work the process to stop any growth. Every new resident who pulls a permit is visited and threatened by a by-law officer. The woman who instigated this specific weapon, a former enviro bureaucrat from LA, demanded full time by-law officers for years until she won, after which she fought for aggressive enforcement.
With this one act, she set islanders against each other, creating conflict where there was none. This too is deliberate. A community divided is easily controlled.
Ring any bells?
At the same time, in our vast swaths of upland forests, the UN organization Transitions is slowly accreting that land. For who? We don’t really know. Transitions is everywhere, in the US, in Canada, in every country in Europe. It is where you live. It is one of the many prongs of Agenda 2030. Everywhere, it invades local governments and acts to suppress economic activity.
Transitions also trades carbon credits. For who? Who do you think?
Therefore Transitions, which has a rainbow-colored smiley PR face, is in that business. Buying land to transfer it to international organizations and mega-rich families so they can make money on our forests. But not us. We can’t. We can’t even thin them to prevent catastrophic forest fire.
Those contracts must be interesting, not that anyone can see them. The first thing they do is act as whacking big first-time tax deductions. The second thing they do is act as an annual tax deduction because those trees are eating CO2. Very clever. International interests buy our land (and yours) and use it to not pay taxes. While banking some of the most valuable assets on the planet.
Multiply this 100,000 times, and you will see just a very tiny piece of the vast tapestry, the puzzle, of the Climate Change/Agenda 2030 plan that will shut down economic activity everywhere.
Imagine these people embedded in every single industry. Because they are. Canada has enough oil and gas to supply the world for the next five hundred years. We have all the rare earth minerals required by electric cars and every green invention. We, the most highly educated work-force in the world, have developed hundreds of mitigations that prevent knock-on effects for the mining we do. Mining is the most productive engine of the economy. Its job multiplier is 7, and all seven jobs are high-paying jobs. Mining means rural counties and townships can thrive, pay for their schools, their healthcare.
Every farm, every ranch, every rural business, every logging operation, every developer, every contractor and builder, every grocery chain, every surprisingly successful business has an activist cadre assigned to it. All that activist does is strategize on how to destroy that business. And they are paid, through environmental organizations funded by BlackRock.
Tucker Carlson ran a piece Monday night about an Amish cattle farmer, the most successful in his region, super-green, who doesn’t use fertilizer or even gas, who was visited and shut down by an armed gang of government thugs.
This is how they operate. Find the most successful in any sector or sub-sector, attack and destroy. No one must accrete enough financial or community-based power to fight back.
They are going to reap the whirlwind.

6165,fake,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-11-12,"11/12/2024 / By Ethan Huff
The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act, which Congress passed just before President Trump declared a public health emergency for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) in early 2020, is not enough to shield the pharmaceutical industry from liability for breach of contract, a U.S. judge ruled this past week.
In a feverish attempt to create the perfect con for Big Pharma to rake in the dough during the “pandemic,” both sides of the American political aisle rushed through the PREP Act, believing it would be the perfect liability shield for COVID jab makers like AstraZeneca, which is on the hook for injuries.
A woman named Brianne Dressen sued AstraZeneca, which produced a viral vector version of a COVID injection – Moderna and Pfizer released mRNA (modRNA) injections – after the shot harmed her in a 2020 clinical trial. AstraZeneca tried to get the suit dropped by playing the PREP Act card, but U.S. District Judge Robert J. Shelby ruled otherwise.
While it is still true that Dressen cannot sue AstraZeneca for her actual injuries – remember, America, that Big Pharma is the only industry that cannot be held liable for injuries caused by its products – she can still sue the company for breach of contract.
“The basis of Dressen’s claim is a broken promise, not a countermeasure,” Judge Shelby said. “Dressen was administered a covered countermeasure, and she was warned that she may suffer from an adverse reaction, but the fact that she suffered from such reaction was not sufficient to ripen her claim.”
“Rather, she only has a claim because AstraZeneca made a contractual promise to her that happened to involve the effects of a covered countermeasure.”
(Related: Earlier this year, AstraZeneca publicly admitted that its COVID injection causes mysterious clots, which is why the company decided to voluntarily pull the shot from the global market.)
In its defense, AstraZeneca submitted a theory via legal filings suggesting that the pharmaceutical industry needs to be shielded from all liability through the PREP Act because otherwise vaccine companies will be less willing to quickly develop countermeasures during so-called public health emergencies. Dressen’s lawyers successfully countered this theory by showing that enforcing the company’s legal contracts achieves the same result.
“If the PREP Act immunized deceptive contractual inducement and sanctioned illusory promises, then no one would agree to undertake the high-risk activities that are critical during public health emergency responses,” Judge Shelby further said.
“The PREP Act drafters could not have intended to allow pharmaceutical companies to make illusory promises to clinical trial participants because doing so would erode public trust and undermine the ability to recruit willing participants, which in turn would erode and undermine pandemic preparedness.”
One of the examples Judge Shelby put forth to back this was AstraZeneca’s initial agreement with Dressen to pay her $125 for time and travel reimbursements each time she visited the clinical trial facility for her injections and associated observation. The consent form she signed stated that AstraZeneca would “cover the costs of research injuries” and “pay the costs of medical treatment.”
“AstraZeneca’s theory of immunity would allow it to shirk this and any other promise made to trial participants merely because the promise ultimately relates to the administration or use of a vaccine,” Judge Shelby explained.
After receiving AstraZeneca’s COVID injection, Dressen developed a spate of injuries that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) officially diagnosed as having occurred because of the experimental shot.
When Dressen first sought reimbursement for medical care, AstraZeneca offered $590.20, which she refused for being “far less” than the amount she actually needed.
The anvil of justice appears ready to fall on Big Pharma for vaccine crimes against humanity. Learn more at BadMedicine.news.

2427,real,INSTITUTIONAL_AND_MEDIA_DISTRUST_PUBLIC_INSTITUTIONS,2024-06-09,"Millions voting on final day of EU elections as right seeks surge
Europeans in 21 countries are going to the polls on the biggest and final day of voting for the European Parliament.
In a year of pivotal elections, the EU vote is especially significant, on a continent witnessing polarised politics and increased nationalism.
The run-up to the vote has been marked by violent incidents - although an attack that left Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen with minor whiplash and forced her to halt campaigning is not being seen as politically motivated.
Europe’s main centre-right grouping is expected to come top across the EU when first projections emerge later on Sunday, however three parties on the far right all have their eye on winning the most seats nationally.
France’s National Rally, Italy’s Brothers of Italy and Austria’s Freedom Party are leading in the polls, as is Belgium’s separatist and anti-immigration party, Vlaams Belang.
Voting already began on Thursday, Friday and Saturday for some EU countries - but the majority of EU member states are voting on Sunday. The European Parliament is the direct link between Europeans and the EU's institutions.
Voting for 16-year-olds
Sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds are voting for the first time in Germany and Belgium, increasing the size of Europe’s youth vote. Young Austrians and Maltese have been able to vote from 16 for some time, and Greeks can vote from 17.
In Germany alone there are an estimated 1.4 million eligible 16 and 17-year-olds among about five million first-time voters, so they could make a difference to the outcome.
The far-right Alternative For Germany (AfD) has claimed success in attracting young men especially, through campaigns on social media platforms such as TikTok.
Belgians are also voting in federal and regional elections, as well as in the European vote. Voting in Belgium is compulsory, and 16-year-old Princess Eléonore cast her ballot for the European election, along with Crown Princess Elisabeth and their two brothers.
But there was little enthusiasm among young Belgians ahead of the vote in the Flemish town of Aalst.
Vlaams Belang has won there before, although until now no other party has been willing to work with it. One young woman called Simona said young people especially were keen on their anti-immigration stance: “They like their policies on people coming here from abroad.”
Many of the town’s young voters approached by the BBC said they had not yet decided how they would vote, on a European or national level.
Dutch anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders visited Aalst on the eve of the vote to boost Vlaams Belang’s chances.
Dutch voters went to the polls on Thursday and exit polls have already suggested his party is narrowly behind a left-green alliance. The result will not be known until Sunday evening.
The priorities of European voters have changed dramatically since the last vote in 2019, with Russia’s war in Ukraine and the cost of living now central in people’s minds, while migration, health and the economy are also key. Five years ago, UK voters took part in the last election before Brexit.
""We want a Europe capable of defending itself,"" says Ursula von der Leyen, who has led the European Commission for the past five years and is campaigning for another term. These elections will also play a big part in deciding who runs the EU’s executive.
But voters are swayed by national issues as much as European politics, as highlighted by the Dutch exit poll, which suggested they were equally important for 48% of voters.
The biggest race on Sunday is in Germany, where 96 of the Parliament’s 720 seats are at stake.
Ms von der Leyen’s conservative CDU/CSU in Germany is widely expected to win, and the biggest battle is for second place, with Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats challenged by both his coalition partner, the Greens, and opposition AfD.
Violence in run-up to vote
Several EU countries have seen violent attacks in the run-up to the vote, and in Germany politicians and campaigners alike have been targeted.
In the eastern city of Dresden, Social Democrat candidate Matthias Ecke was seriously hurt in an attack by teenagers and a Green activist was attacked, while in Berlin a former minister was hit over the head.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser has warned of a new dimension of anti-democratic violence and said Germany’s law and constitution “must and will continue to increase the protection of democratic forces in our country”.
Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico narrowly escaped with his life after he was shot while meeting supporters last month.
He has since turned his anger on his political opponents, in an apparent bid to boost support for his populist left Smer party.
Denmark’s Social Democrat Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen was knocked to the ground by a man on Friday, and although there was no apparent political motive she did have to halt campaigning.
Races to watch in France and Hungary
In France, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally is hoping to increase its share of the country's 81 seats, with polls suggesting a big lead over President Emmanuel Macron’s Renew party and the resurgent Socialists under Raphaël Glucksmann.
The big draw for National Rally has been its 28-year-old leader, Jordan Bardella, who has led the European campaign.
So seriously has the government taken Mr Bardella that Prime Minister Gabriel Attal joined him in a one-on-one debate, attacking his party’s close relationship with the Kremlin.
Mr Macron’s party list for this election is led by Valérie Hayer, a little-known politician in comparison with Jordan Bardella.
Meanwhile, in Hungary, Viktor Orban's Fidesz party is facing one of the biggest challenges to his rule so far from Peter Magyar and his new centre-right Tisza party.
For all the big national races, the real power in the European Parliament is wielded by political groupings from different member states, and it is the centre-right European People’s Party made up of conservative parties across the EU that is widely tipped to remain the biggest political force in the 720-seat chamber.
The centre left has few parties in power in Europe, but is still expected to come second.
It is the two right-wing groups, home to several far-right parties, that are expected to increase their support.
Giorgia Meloni’s party Brothers of Italy sits in the European Conservatives and Reformists along with Spain's Vox and the Sweden Democrats, while France’s National Rally is part of Identity & Democracy, as well as Italy's League and Austria's Freedom Party.
That leaves open the question whether they are prepared to work together, or if they might find common ground with the centre right.
The big losers in this contest could be the centrists, who include France’s Renew, and the Greens. As one Green campaigner in Brussels said on the eve of the vote: “Everything has moved to the right.”."
3826,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-06-13,"For the first time, West Texas has a permanent LGBTQ+ community center
ODESSA, Texas (AP) — Patty Reeves stood centerstage overlooking a park dotted with dozens of people from West Texas’ LGBTQ+ community. There were clusters of families and friend groups. A local church brought congregants who sat in lawn chairs in the front row.
The cheerful atmosphere at the fifth annual pride festival in West Texas had shifted. A suicide had rocked the community. Luna Harris, a 19-year-old gender-nonconforming person, died two days earlier.
As a warm gust carried dust through the park, Reeves delivered her speech.
“What I see in West Texas is a community that says, ‘I am here. I am thriving. You will not erase us,’” she said.
Like many present that day, Reeves, the president of PFLAG’s Midland and Odessa chapter, wanted to believe in her message. But at that moment, she couldn’t.
“I said those words because that’s what I hope for,” Reeves said offstage. “But then I thought: Are we really?”
The sudden loss hovered over the festivities meant to close a busy week of events, which included the grand opening of a brick-and-mortar community center for the region’s LGBTQ+ community.
It was also, Reeves and others said, a sobering reminder that underscored how necessary spaces like the festival and the community center are — especially in a state such as Texas where Republican lawmakers and other policymakers are working to limit how LGBTQ+ people live their lives.
During the last decade, several organizations that support the Permian Basin’s LGBTQ+ community have sprung up. None have had a permanent — and visible — home of their own. That changed in April when Pride Center West Texas opened its doors to the public.
The center’s grand opening was four years in the making. It all started when Bryan and Clint Wilson moved to Midland, from Florida in 2020. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the couple shuttered their consulting services to move back and be closer to family.
The married couple had been active in LGBTQ+ nonprofits in Florida, and registered Pride Center West Texas as a nonprofit with plans to open a center once they settled. That summer, the first center opened on the third floor of a building in downtown Odessa with a conference room and group spaces, Clint said.
The center outgrew that space. And in 2021, they moved the center to another building downtown, next to a bank. There, the Wilsons, volunteers and the center’s board held events and group sessions for two years before outgrowing the space again. In 2023, the couple moved the center to a church. But after the Wilsons held a drag show for adults, members of the church’s board voted to evict them. Until this year, the couple operated the center out of Sanctuary Wyrd, a shop that sells gems, crystals and art — and has doubled as a refuge, opening its doors to other organizations that hosted monthly meetings and movie nights.
Now the center is tucked away in a nondescript strip mall behind a busy Italian restaurant.
A rainbow placard hangs on the glass facing the street. At the entrance, the Wilsons have placed desks for people to work at. They do not charge patrons for using the space. A clerk sits by the window, welcoming every straggler. Farther down the hall, visitors may chat on a sofa and chairs while others study the collection of books on a shelf. Pamphlets containing information about sexually transmitted diseases line the countertop of a bar area in the back.
Among its programming, it offers youth groups for adults aged 18-25 to discuss different subjects. Some weeks, it hosts group discussions on religion. On Fridays, visitors can drop in for Queer Connection, a support group for adults. The center also offers its space as an office to other local organizations serving the LGBTQ+ community.
Reeves, the PFLAG president, also moved to Midland from Arlington in 2020 with her husband and trans teenager, Milo. Before looking for a house, Reeves said, she and her husband searched for available resources for her teen, who is now 17. Bryan and Clint helped the family by connecting them to the local network of organizations focused on supporting LGBTQ+ youth. Reeves volunteered for a year before becoming president of PFLAG in 2021.
“Finding the Pride Center was the best thing that happened to us,” Reeves said. “I came as a parent, I didn’t know what to do.”
Funding such community centers is a priority for Texas Pride Impact Fund, a nonprofit charity organization that grants money to support programs and community centers across Texas. Since 2018, it has awarded $2 million to organizations in Abilene, Corpus Christi, El Paso, Lubbock, Eagle Pass, the Rio Grande Valley and others. The fund traveled to Odessa in June to document the center and show the results of its work to donors in Fort Worth.
Ron Guillard, the fund’s executive director, said it’s unclear how many similar organizations exist across Texas — especially outside the major metropolitan areas. A national database suggested there are 20, but not all operate out of a physical space. For many, Guillard said, a brick-and-mortar is aspirational.
Míchél Macklin, the fund’s communications and administrative coordinator, said rural community centers do more with a fraction of the budget of bigger cities. A challenge for the community hubs like the West Texas center, they said, is working with scarce resources. The fund found that the support the organizations provide to each other has enabled their success.
“I think the folks who are in the Permian Basin are creating connective tissue among each other and pooling the resources, however small they may be ... to create a larger compound or silo of resources that can be shared among one another,” Macklin said.
Guillard agreed: “What I find most striking is that (rural centers) appear to be more cohesive than the major cities because they’re led by a younger set of activists,” Guillard said. “Especially in towns like Eagle Pass and Odessa, there are communities, those on the frontlines working across the spectrum. And they understand that that is the fight.”
Guillard said he had seen promising examples of other LGBTQ+ organizations aiming to open brick-and-mortar centers in El Paso, Corpus Christi and the Rio Grande Valley.
Harris, the 19-year-old who died by suicide, was a regular volunteer at the center since 2022. They helped organize meetings and events. And they helped produce the local Pride celebration, often performing original songs. Full of ideas, they proposed a chocolate bar stand and a firecracker sale to help raise money.
They were talkative and outgoing, their friends said. They wrote songs and performed them with an operatic tone, people close to them said. In high school, Harris sang in a choir. For the 2024 Pride festival, Harris had volunteered to face-paint and perform a song.
The Wilsons and other advocates were stunned. How could this happen to someone so deeply involved with the tight-knit community?
“What is enough?” Clint said. “How many resources are enough resources? What is enough for a community to feel accepted? It’s a very hard question.”
Nationwide, 42% of transgender adults will attempt suicide, according to a 2023 report by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, which used data from the U.S. Transgender Population Health Survey. Nearly as many, 44%, said they considered it.
Contributing to this harsh reality in Texas is a Legislature that has introduced scores of bills seeking to regulate how LGBTQ+ people live. Republican lawmakers filed more than 100 bills between the last legislative session and the following special sessions. Some passed, including a ban on puberty blockers and hormone therapy for trans kids, limiting the college sports teams trans athletes can join and an attempt to limit where drag performances can take place.
“All LGBTQ people have to be really resilient because we know our rights are always on the line,” said Brad Pritchett, deputy director of Equality Texas, a statewide political advocacy organization. “In places like Texas, where you’re under a constant barrage from lawmakers trying to find new and creative ways to harm your community, it really does take an extra ounce of resilience to continue saying, ‘This is my home, I’m not leaving it, I’m gonna stay and defend it.’”
While LGBTQ+ organizations have been staples in major American cities since the 1970s, it has only been in the last decade that similar groups have started in Midland and Odessa. Among them are the West Texas chapter of PFLAG, the first organization in the country dedicated to advocating for LGBTQ+ people and their families, which arrived in Midland and Odessa in 2014. There is also Out West Texas, which serves transgender West Texans and started in 2017, and Basin Pride, founded in 2019, has arranged the logistics for putting together Pride festivals.
“This is hard work, to keep the community going,” said Adriana Aguilar, who joined Basin Pride in 2021 and now serves as its chair. Aguilar, 28, volunteered for the center in 2020.
The effort to establish and grow more inclusive spaces can draw unwanted attention.
Last January, Aguilar, Basin Pride chair, said she and a group of volunteers attempted to host a family-friendly, Barbie-themed event that included a drag show and local artists. The group secured a venue, performers and volunteers. But days before the event, organized protesters flocked the surrounding area, and the county sheriff was called. Agitators threatened Aguilar with protests. Aguilar postponed the event indefinitely. And because of the event, several sponsors who had offered to support the Pride festival backed out. Aguilar said she had two months to regroup and find other financial supporters.
“Basin Pride is growing, which is great,” she said. “But that means we have more eyes on us, that we’re under certain radars that we weren’t before.”
And on Tuesday, an Odessa City Council member suggested the city should limit the use of public restrooms based on a person’s sex assigned at birth, the Odessa American reported. Such policies are routinely used to discriminate against transgender people.
Other Odessans have responded positively to their growth — or are at least indifferent.
Earlier this year, the center began hosting a bingo night at the Odessa Veterans of Foreign Wars hall. The Wilsons and other volunteers wear grey shirts with long, pink sleeves, floating through the hall selling bingo cards and dobbers. Lorraine Wilson, Bryan’s mom, calls the evening’s numbers.
It was Lorraine’s idea. She proposed it to Rick Mitchell, the VFW hall’s commander in February, who then brought it to his members for a vote. It was unanimous.
“They’re a human being just like I’m a human being is the way I see it,” said Mitchell, a lifelong conservative from Kermit who lives in Odessa. “It doesn’t affect me one bit.”
Samantha Washington has been playing bingo at the hall for 15 years. The 49-year-old introduced her daughters, Elisha and Mesha, to the tradition. Bingo nights are a family getaway, she said. That the proceeds from Monday night help fund the Pride Center doesn’t bother her one bit, she said, so long as there is bingo.
“I don’t mind supporting them,” Washington said. “It’s people’s rights.”
The proceeds from bingo night don’t cover the expenses of running the center, but it helps, the Wilsons said. The couple hopes they will someday earn enough from that and other grants to expand their services and reach.
After Harris’ death, they said, their services are crucial to the community.
“We have to be able to give what we have now,” Clint said. “We have to rally and still continue what we have now. The main question that Bryan and I had was, how could this happen on our watch? It forces us to see how we can improve our reach.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden’s administration will help 50 countries identify and respond to infectious diseases, with the goal of preventing pandemics like the COVID-19 outbreak that suddenly halted normal life around the globe in 2020.
U.S. government officials will offer support in the countries, most of them located in Africa and Asia, to develop better testing, surveillance, communication and preparedness for such outbreaks in those countries.
The strategy will help “prevent, detect and effectively respond to biological threats wherever they emerge,” Biden said in a statement Tuesday.
The Global Health Security Strategy, the president said, aims to protect people worldwide and “will make the United States stronger, safer, and healthier than ever before at this critical moment.”
The announcement about the strategy comes as countries have struggled to meet a worldwide accord on responses to future pandemics. Four years after the coronavirus pandemic, prospects of a pandemic treaty signed by all 194 of the World Health Organization’s members are flailing.
Talks for the treaty are ongoing, with a final text expected to be agreed upon next month in Geneva. It’s meant to be a legally binding treaty that obliges countries to monitor pandemic threats and share scientific findings. But major disputes have emerged over vaccine equity and transferring the technology used to make vaccines.
Even if a deal is hammered out, there would be few consequences for countries that choose not to abide by the treaty.
The U.S. will push on with its global health strategy to prevent future pandemics, regardless of a pandemic treaty or not, a senior administration official told reporters on Monday.
Several U.S. government agencies — including the State Department, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Health and Human Services and the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID — will help countries refine their infectious disease response.
Health systems around the globe have been overwhelmed with COVID-19 and other health emergencies such as Ebola, malaria and mpox, the CDC said in a statement. The new strategy will help countries rebuild their agencies, the U.S. agency explained.
“Global health security is national security, and CDC is proud to contribute its expertise, investments and rapid response to protect the health and safety of the American people and the world,” Mandy Cohen, the CDC’s director, said in a statement.
Congo is one country where work has already begun. The U.S. government is helping Congo with its response to an mpox virus outbreak, including with immunizations. Mpox, a virus that’s in the same family as the one that causes smallpox, creates painful skin lesions. The World Health Organization declared mpox a global emergency in 2022, and there have been more than 91,000 cases spanning across 100 countries to date.
The White House on Tuesday released a website with the names of the countries that are participating in the program. Biden officials are seeking to get 100 countries signed onto the program by the end of the year.
The U.S. has devoted billions of dollars, including money raised from private donations, to the effort. Biden, a Democrat, is asking for $1.2 billion for global health safety efforts in his yearly budget proposal to Congress.

3885,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-09-10,"An epilepsy drug could help prevent the breathing of patients with sleep apnoea from temporarily stopping, according to research.
Obstructive sleep apnoea is a common breathing problem that affects about one in 20 people, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in England. Patients often snore loudly, their breathing starts and stops during the night and they may wake up several times. Not only does this cause tiredness but it can also increase the risk of high blood pressure, stroke, heart disease and type 2 diabetes.
An international study has identified that an epilepsy medication is associated with a marked reduction in sleep apnoea symptoms.
The findings, presented at the European Respiratory Society Congress in Vienna, Austria, demonstrated there were possible options for those unable to use mechanical breathing aids such as continuous positive airway pressure (Cpap) machines.
Prof Jan Hedner, from Sahlgrenska university hospital and the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, said: “The standard treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea is sleeping with a machine that blows air through a face mask to keep the airways open. Unfortunately, many people find these machines hard to use over the long term, so there is a need to find alternative treatments.”
The researchers conducted a randomised controlled trial of almost 300 obstructive sleep apnoea patients in Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany and Spain who did not use the Cpap machines. They were divided into four groups and given one of three strengths of sulthiame or a placebo.
The study measured patients’ breathing, oxygen levels, heart rhythm, eye movements, as well as brain and muscle activity while asleep, at the start of the trial, after four weeks and after 12 weeks.
It found after 12 weeks, those taking sulthiame had up to 50% fewer occasions where their breathing stopped and higher levels of oxygen in their blood during sleep. The effects were most marked in the highest doses of the drug.
Hedner said the findings suggested sulthiame could be an effective treatment for the condition and that a bigger study was needed to confirm the beneficial respiratory effects of the drug on a larger group of sleep apnoea patients.
Erika Radford, the head of health advice at Asthma + Lung UK, said the findings were a first step in moving away from breathing equipment worn while asleep to a drug-based treatment. “This potential alternative to the current main treatment would make it easier for people to manage their condition,” she added.
Dr Sriram Iyer, a consultant respiratory and sleep physician and president-elect of the Royal Society of Medicine’s sleep medicine section, said: “This is an important study highlighting that drug therapy for sleep apnoea is not far off from being a reality.”
While more studies would examine the long-term benefits, any side-effects and whether there are specific types of patients that would benefit more from treatment, it was “vitally important we don’t forget that sleep apnoea is, in the majority of cases, linked to obesity and addressing this should be the priority”, he said."

It is certainly true that the majority of LGBT voters do support the Democrats, but they are still a minority in the United States.
Meanwhile the Biden Harris campaign is losing support from Black voters, Latino voters and young voters.
Fox News reports: President Biden and Vice President Harris’ re-election campaign has announced a new push to win over a group of voters that it claims is “a force to be reckoned with.” The initiative comes just seven months ahead of the president’s rematch with the presumptive Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump.
As Biden seeks to win another term in the White House despite facing historic low approval ratings, Team Biden-Harris announced the launch of “Out for Biden-Harris.” The campaign describes the program as a national effort to mobilize LGBTQ+ voters and community members across the country.
In a statement, Biden-Harris 2024 campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said, “LGBTQ+ voters are a force to be reckoned with.”
“They were critical to our victory in 2020, and they will be critical to winning again this November,” Chavez Rodriguez added. “That’s why we’re thrilled to launch Out for Biden-Harris, which will harness the LGBTQ+ community’s organizing prowess to reelect President Biden and Vice President Harris this November.”
In a campaign video that accompanied the announcement, Vice President Harris said, “Rights are won only by those who make their voices heard. And because you made your voices heard, marriages are more secure.”
“We will do what we have always done in this movement, in this community, which is collectively, we will continue to build unity. We will continue to build coalition. We will always be fueled by knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us. We will be fueled by knowing we are all in this together,” Harris said."
3931,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-07-16,"Elon Musk on Tuesday said he will move the headquarters of SpaceX and X to Texas after a California law blocked schools from forcing teachers to notify parents about changes to a student's gender identity.
""This is the final straw,"" Musk said on X a day after California governor Gavin Newsom signed the bill that fired up the already fraught culture wars in a tumultuous US election year.
""Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas,"" Musk said.
The multi-billionaire also said that he is transferring X, formerly Twitter, from its art-deco headquarters in San Francisco to Austin, a threat he has made before but never saw to completion.
""Have had enough of dodging gangs of violent drug addicts just to get in and out of the building,"" Musk wrote.
Musk has already moved Tesla's headquarters from Palo Alto in Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas, but still maintains an ""engineering headquarters"" in California.
The tycoon has expressed deep disdain for the use of preferred pronouns, often mocking the practice on social media and dismissing it as part of a ""woke"" agenda that was dangerous for society.
Musk is the father of a trans daughter from whom he is estranged, and he blames her California private school education for making her politically far left and turning her against him.
Gender issues
Newsom on Monday enacted the law after a contentious legislative process that pitted a handful of school boards fighting for parental rights against LGBTQ activists concerned about the welfare of vulnerable students.
The law reversed decisions in conservative school districts that ordered teachers to notify parents if a student changed their name or pronouns, or requested to use facilities or participate in programs that didn't match their official gender.
Newsom, who is seen as a potential alternative to President Joe Biden as the Democratic candidate for the White House, has often exchanged fire with conservatives over gender issues at state schools.
Last year, he signed a law that sets fines for school districts that ban textbooks portraying LGBTQ people and other marginalized groups.
Newsom also fought bitterly with a conservative school board over its opposition to the study of gay rights figure Harvey Milk, a San Francisco public official who was assassinated.
Musk has previously sparred with Newsom, who is a former San Francisco mayor, during the deadliest stages of the Covid-19 pandemic when he challenged the decisions of city and state health officials.

3782,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-10-01,"Tim Walz’s state became a ‘trans refuge.’ Here’s what that means and how it happened
Minnesota trans refuge
MINNEAPOLIS — As Gov. Tim Walz prepares to debate Sen. JD Vance Tuesday night, Minnesota’s status as a “trans refuge” state will likely be in the spotlight.
“He’s very heavy into transgender, anything transgender he thinks is great,” former President Trump said on Fox the day after Walz was announced as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate. (Trump has pledged, if elected, to end gender-affirming care for youth nationally.)
In Arizona earlier this month, Vance falsely claimed the “trans refuge” law Walz signed allows the state to “take children away from their parents if their parents don’t want to do sex changes.” He added, “that is not small government, that is disgusting, and he should be ashamed of himself.”
Here’s what the “trans refuge” law in Minnesota is, how it’s working, and how involved Walz was in getting the law passed.
A Democratic trifecta
The first thing to understand about how politically purple Minnesota came to pass this law, is that in 2022, voters elected Democratic majorities in both houses of the legislature and the governorship. It was the first Democratic trifecta in a decade, and lawmakers came in with a list of priorities.
Making the state a “trans refuge” wasn’t on that list. But freshman Rep. Leigh Finke, the first transgender member of Minnesota’s state legislature, made sure it was added.
“I knew that we had to do something because the national, coordinated anti-trans wave was building steam,” Finke says.
In 2023, between January and May, 15 states across the country enacted laws banning gender-affirming care for youth, including Minnesota’s neighboring states of Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota.
“The dominoes fell in 2023,” Finke says. “The self-evident urgency became clear to the members of the Minnesota legislature.”
Walz’s support was key to passage
Walz, from the governor’s mansion, was an active ally in the effort to protect transgender people in the state and not a newcomer to the issues, Finke says. “Walz is a teacher and his history includes being the Gay Straight Alliance advisor at Mankato West [high school],” she points out. “People who are around young people and have seen what it means to deny people their authentic fullness — they understand it.”
He was “clear eyed in his support for this all along,” Finke says, and quickly signed an executive order to put some protections in place in case the bill didn’t get through the legislature. Because her party had only a very slim majority, Finke says she spoke to “every single Democrat in the legislature — and some of them for hours and hours,” about the bill and its importance.
The day of the vote in the House, protestors arguing for and against the bill filled the state house. Debate on the floor was contentious and many hours long. “We voted at 5:45 in the morning in the House — it was a filibuster situation — and everybody stayed up and made it happen,” she said. In the end, the bill passed in both the house and the senate, and only two Democrats across the legislature voted against it, she says. “I feel incredibly proud and grateful.”
Walz signed the bill in front of cameras. As he signed, he said “Love wins,” and handed one pen to preteen Hildie Edwards, who had testified in support of the law, and another to Rep. Finke.
What the law says
The text of the law protects the privacy of both patients and clinicians when it comes to gender-affirming care in Minnesota.
“If you are trying to access health care for transition-related reasons, you can access that care in the state of Minnesota no matter where you live, and while you are in the state of Minnesota, our laws will protect you,” Finke explains.
The law also protects medical providers from out-of-state subpoenas. Finke points to how Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton tried to get medical records for transgender Texans from Seattle Children’s Hospital. “Under our bill, the attorney general is tasked with protecting people in Minnesota to receive gender-affirming care,” she says, so hospitals and doctors in the state don’t need to worry about that kind of effort.
The law does not regulate the care itself — it was already legal in Minnesota, and the details of a patient’s treatment are governed by standards of care, and by an individual’s choices, made in consultation with their family and doctor.
One provision of the law concerns custody cases, which Vance pointed to when he claimed the state of Minnesota could kidnap kids. “There's nothing like that anywhere around this law — it's a made up lie,” Finke says. The bill allows certain custody cases to be heard in family court in Minnesota and judges to issue temporary orders, but it does not determine which parent gets custody or hand custody to the state. “The state cannot claim jurisdiction or custody of a child,” she says. “Of course it can't.”
A trans influx
Since Minnesota’s trans refuge law was in response to anti-trans legislation in states across the country, the circumstances are “much more tragic than celebratory,” Finke says.
Many trans people and their families living in states with bans feel like they’re being driven out. “Hundreds of people and families within the first six months moved to Minnesota — I'm sure that's a major undercount,” Finke says. “And I know as the election comes, we're getting more and more.” She says trans people and their families are worried about what another Trump presidency could mean for their rights, not just in relation to health care access, but also military service, housing and employment discrimination, among other issues.
Since Minnesota’s law took effect last spring, it has affected health care providers in the state. Children’s Minnesota, which runs a gender program for youth, has seen an increase of about 30% in calls from patients in neighboring states. The hospital tells NPR their waitlist is about a year long for new patients, and they have hired new clinicians to keep up with demand. Family Tree Clinic, a Minneapolis provider of gender-affirming care, has begun a program to help train more physicians on this kind of care around the state.
Some families who can’t relocate end up driving hundreds of miles to see gender-affirming care providers in Minnesota. One Minneapolis doctor told NPR he currently has 15 patients who do so.
Walz leans in
On the presidential campaign trail, Walz isn’t shy about his support for LGBTQ+ rights.
He headlined the recent Human Rights Campaign annual dinner and proudly enumerated the ways that both he and Harris have supported LGBTQ+ rights through their careers. He told the crowd, as he has said many times on the campaign trail, that there’s a saying in Minnesota: “Everything works better if you just mind your own damn business and I'll mind mine.”
“That's truly a long standing Minnesota value here,” says Finke, who was born and raised in the state. “People don't necessarily want to get involved, for better or worse, in their neighbors' lives, and that has allowed us to do a lot of good progressive work.”
“Some of the earliest trans action for civil rights was done here,” she adds. “In 1978, there was a case argued by the ACLU for a trans woman in the Army to be able to stay and keep her job. We were the first state to protect trans people in our Human Rights Act. It's always just been a part of the fabric here.”
The personal is political
Rep. Leigh Finke has faced fierce opposition to her trans legislative work — including threats and harassment. In a way, that has helped fuel her own political rise. “I’m a little bit famous in the Midwest,” she grins.
“There were some viral moments from the House floor from conservatives going on tirades against me and against trans people, and it provided an opportunity for us to be able to stand strong, to be able to say, ‘Here we are, queer forever, you can't just yell at us and have us go away,’” she says.
She’s had positive attention, too. Last year, she was named the USA Today “Woman of the Year” for Minnesota, and she was recognized as a “Health Hero” by Children’s Minnesota.
And she is happy that there is more representation of trans people in public life than when she was growing up in the 80s and 90s in suburban Minnesota. “You can’t be what you can’t see,” she says, noting that she didn’t come out as trans until adulthood. “And I'm so grateful that I did. And I'm so grateful that I get to be in a position now where other people can see not just that there are trans people, but that we're succeeding.”
But when she knocks on doors for her re-election bid this fall, Finke says trans issues are not what voters are concerned about. “I think that, in general, people don't want to be talking about trans kids, they would rather just let us live our lives.”
She’s happy to talk about her other political priorities, like housing and the arts and urban tree policy, instead."
2404,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-06-06,"A man in Mexico died with one form of bird flu, but US officials remain focused on another
NEW YORK (AP) — The mysterious death of a man in Mexico who had one kind of bird flu is unrelated to outbreaks of a different type at U.S. dairy farms, experts say.
Here’s a look at the case and the different types of bird flu.
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MEXICO BIRD FLU CASE?
A 59-year-old man in Mexico who had been bedridden because of chronic health problems developed a fever, shortness of breath and diarrhea in April. He died a week later, and the World Health Organization this week reported it.
The WHO said it was the first time that version of bird flu — H5N2 — had been seen in a person.
WHAT’S BEEN HAPPENING IN THE U.S. WITH BIRD FLU?
A different version of bird flu — H5N1 — has been infecting poultry flocks over the last several years, leading to millions of birds being culled. It also has been spreading among all different kinds of animals around the world.
This year, that flu was detected in U.S. dairy farms. Dozens of herd have seen infections, most recently in Iowa and Minnesota.
The cow outbreak has been tied to three reported illnesses in farmworkers, one in Texas and two in Michigan. Each had only mild symptoms.
WHAT’S DO THE LETTERS AND NUMBERS MEAN IN BIRD FLU NAMES?
So-called influenza A viruses are the only viruses tied to human flu pandemics, so their appearance in animals and people is a concern. These viruses are divided into subtypes based on what kinds of proteins they have on their surface — hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N).
Scientists say there are 18 different “H” subtypes and 11 different “N” subtypes, and they appear in scores of combinations. H1N1 and H3N2 are common causes of seasonal flu among humans. There are many versions seen in animals as well.
H5N1, the version that has worried some U.S. scientists lately, historically has been seen mainly in birds, but has in recent years has spread to a wide variety of mammals.
WHAT IS H5N2?
H5N2 has long been seen in Mexican poultry, and farms vaccinate against it.
It’s also no stranger to the United States. An H5N2 outbreak hit a flock of 7,000 chickens in south-central Texas in 2004, the first time in two decades a dangerous-to-poultry avian flu appeared in the U.S.
H5N2 also was mainly responsible for a wave outbreaks at U.S. commercial poultry farms in 2014 and 2015.
HOW DANGEROUS IS H5N2?
Over the years, H5N2 has teetered between being considered a mild threat to birds and a severe threat, but it hasn’t been considered much of a human threat at all.
A decade ago, researchers used mice and ferrets to study the strain afflicting U.S. poultry at the time, and concluded it was less likely to spread and less lethal than H5N1. Officials also said there was no evidence it was spreading among people.
Rare cases of animal infections are reported each year, so it’s not unexpected that a person was diagnosed with H5N2.
“If you’re a glass half full kind of person, you’d say, ‘This is the system doing exactly what it’s supposed to do: detecting and documenting these rare human infections, where years ago we were stumbling in the dark,’” said Matthew Ferrari, director of Penn State’s Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics.
Indeed, Mexico Health Secretary Jorge Alcocer said kidney and respiratory failure — not the virus — actually caused the man’s death.
Some experts said it is noteworthy that it’s not known how he caught the man caught H5N2.
“The fact there was no reported contact (with an infected bird) does raise the possibility that he was infected by someone else who visited him, but it’s premature to jump to those conclusions,” said Richard Webby, a flu researcher at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis.
WHAT ABOUT OTHER TYPES OF BIRD FLU?
At this point, H5N2 is still considered a minor threat compared to some of the other kinds of bird flu out there. Most human illnesses have been attributed to H7N9, H5N6 and H5N1 bird flu viruses.
From early 2013 through October 2017, five outbreaks of H7N9 were blamed for killing more than 600 people in China. And at least 18 people in China died during an outbreak of H5N6 in 2021, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
H5N1 was first identified in 1959, but didn’t really began to worry health officials until a Hong Kong outbreak in 1997 that involved severe human illnesses and deaths.
H5N1 cases have continued since then, the vast majority of them involving direct contact between people and infected animals. Globally, more than 460 human deaths have been identified since 2003, according to WHO statistics that suggest it can kill as many as half of the people reported to be infected.
Like other viruses, H5N1 as evolved over time, spawning newer versions of itself. In the last few years, the predominant version of the virus has spread quickly among a wide range of animals, but counts of human fatalities have slowed.

BUTLER, Pa. (AP) — The hotel on the outskirts of town looks a lot like lodging one can find on any American highway. Over the years it has been a Holiday Inn and a Days Inn. The sign outside now bears the brand of a new, growing chain. One that promises a lot more than a good night’s sleep.
At the Tesla Wellness Hotel and MedBed Center, about 45 minutes north of Pittsburgh, the enticements are nothing short of miraculous.
Part motel, part new-age clinic, the facility offers nightly rentals in rooms that come equipped with “BioHealers” –- canisters that the company claims exude “life force energy,” or biophotons. Testimonials from the company’s patients speak to the devices’ power to treat cancer, dementia, chronic pain and a long list of other ailments.
The center also sells the canisters for home use. Prices start at $599 and range all the way to $11,000 for the largest model, with slightly cheaper versions available for pets and children.
The role of conspiracy theories in American politics and society
Conspiracy theories, which have a long history in the U.S., are influencing our politics, our culture and even our health care. There are psychological reasons why anyone could believe in these theories — and ways people can escape.
This series explores the high stakes for individuals and society.
- History: Even before the revolution, America was a nation of conspiracy theorists
- The grave peril: ‘What happens when no one believes anything anymore?’

Just don’t call the thousands of people who have shelled out big bucks to Tesla “patients.” Dr. James Liu, the physician who founded Tesla, doesn’t like the term -– perhaps the first clue that what he’s selling goes far beyond the abilities of traditional medicine.
“We are not a clinic, not a doctor’s office,” said Liu, who earned a medical degree in China and a Ph.D. in human nutrition at Penn State University. “For me, for the company, I always call them customers.”
Tesla Biohealing, which has no connection to the car company, is part of a growth industry marketing unproven cures and treatments to conspiracy theorists and others who have grown distrustful of science and medicine. Experts who study such claims say they’re on the increase, thanks to the internet, social media and skepticism about traditional health care.
“There have always been hucksters selling medical cures, but I do feel like it’s accelerating,” said Timothy Caulfield, a health policy and law professor at the University of Alberta who studies medical ethics and fraud. “There are some forces driving that: obviously the internet and social media, and distrust of traditional medicine, traditional science. Conspiracy theories are creating and feeding this distrust.”
Blending the high-tech jargon of Western science with the spiritual terminology of traditional and Eastern medicine, these modern salesmen claim their treatments can reverse aging, restore mental acuity or fight COVID-19 better than a vaccine. They promise better health, but what they’re really selling is the idea of insider information, the promise of a secret known only to the wealthy and the powerful.
So-called medbeds are one of the flashiest, most expensive, and least credible. “Medbeds are coming,” exclaims a woman in one TikTok video. Similar videos have been seen millions of times on the platform.
According to believers of the QAnon conspiracy theory, medbeds were developed by the military (in some versions, using alien technology) and are already in use by the world’s richest and most powerful families. Many accounts claim former President Donald Trump, if he wins another term in the White House, will unveil the devices and make them free for all Americans.
Whole message boards on Telegram are devoted to discussions about medbeds, and the latest rumors about when and where they will arrive.
“I’m desperately seeking any help from all to answer my prayers to a cure for my son’s cancer,” wrote one woman on another Telegram channel created by medbed conspiracy theorists in New Jersey.
For those waiting for medbeds to arrive, Tesla BioHealers may be tempting alternative, though one that comes with a cost.
A one-night stay in a “highly-energized” room at the Tesla complex in Butler runs for $300. The rooms look like any other motel room, although a look beneath the bed reveals several of the biophoton devices placed underneath. The company runs seven other medbed centers in other states and its devices are used at several other “partner” facilities operated by other businesses.
Inside the canisters? A mix of “fine naturally active stones and activated fine metal, grout, sands and proprietary polymers that are manufactured with a special technology,” according to the company.
In addition to the biophoton emitting cannisters, the company also sells bottled water — 24-packs of 16.9 ounce bottles of Tennessee spring water — for $150. The company says the water has been imbued with “life force energy” that can increase energy and libido, improve breathing, digestion and sleep, reduce pain and lead to “vivid dreams to indicate enhanced brain activity.”
At Walmart, a 24-pack of 16.9 ounce of generic brand water bottles retails for less than $4.
Online testimonials from Tesla’s customers speak to the life-changing power of the company’s products, with gushing superlatives such as “It worked miracles!” But experts and scientists who have studied the company’s claims say there’s no scientific evidence to support them.
Tesla acknowledges the facts in its terms of service: “Tesla BioHealing does not provide any medical advice,” the fine print says. “Our products... are not intended to replace your physicians’ care, diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or medical condition.”
Liu told The Associated Press that he was unfamiliar with the medbed conspiracy theory when he named his company and that he isn’t trying to exploit gullible people who want to believe medbeds are real. He said 40,000 people have used his devices so far, and that he believes the cannisters can treat about 80% of all disease.
Given the primary importance of health, it’s hardly surprising that unproven medical claims and products that seem too-good-to-be-true have a long history in America. More than a century ago, hucksters peddled magic elixirs from wagons. Decades later, electricity sparked a brief craze in electric belts and magnet suits as a supposed cure for anxiety, paralysis or sexual problems. In the 1920s, a quack named John Brinkley became a household name by implanting goat testicles into the bodies of patients complaining of infertility and impotence. He later lost his medical license after he was exposed as a fraud.
In the 1970s and 1980s, the back pages of magazines were filled with ads for mail-order diet pills and supplements that made promises not backed up by the facts.
Today the same claims are made online, where they’ve found a niche audience among conspiracy theorists and others distrustful of science and traditional medicine. “Shop Now!” reads the website of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who sells supplements and vitamins alongside survival gear and emergency food rations.
These online communities were thriving long before the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw an explosion of false claims about vaccines, communicable diseases and even basic medical science.
And as the adherents’ suspicion of traditional medicine, the media and the government has grown, more people are willing to put their faith in untested treatments and unproven claims.
In some cases, that faith can have deadly results. Last year, a Florida preacher and members of his family were convicted for selling a COVID-19 cure that was actually toxic industrial bleach. Others have died after ingesting other unproven COVID-19 cures such as chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine, which was promoted by Trump as president. Conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and immunization have also spurred opposition to the lifesaving vaccine.
The Food and Drug Administration maintains an online database of unproven or harmful treatments that it has identified, including unapproved treatments for COVID-19 that contain harmful chemicals, autism “cures” that include raw camel milk and the ingestion of dangerous heavy metals, and medications that supposedly cure all cancer.
“ Distrust of government and distrust of major institutions makes people vulnerable,” said Stephen Barrett, a psychiatrist and expert in unproven medical claims who launched the organization Quackwatch in the 1970s to highlight medical scams. “But there are other factors too: Some people are desperate for help and they don’t know what to believe.”
Health care fraud is big business, and the largest source of civil fines and penalties for fraud paid to the federal government last year — more than $5 billion. Most investigations and prosecutions focused on schemes to defraud public health programs such as Medicaid and Medicare or the billions of dollars set aside for COVID-19. As a result, low-level hucksters or those peddling unproven treatments often don’t get as much attention.
Liu and other Tesla employees are quick to defend their work, arguing they are only giving people alternatives to a medical system many no longer trust.
Like the automotive company owned by Elon Musk, Tesla BioHealing is named for Nikola Tesla, the 19th-century inventor and early electrical pioneer who, who like Musk, has become a favorite of many conspiracy theorists.
Many of Tesla Biohealing’s customers have grown frustrated with the answers they get from doctors, said Seth Robinson, a chiropractor who directs Tesla’s clinic in Delaware. Asked to describe a typical Tesla patient, Robinson doesn’t hesitate.
“Desperate, desperate, desperate is the word,” he said. “A lot of times people will come here, they will have anti-medicine thoughts, feelings. We’re not anti-medicine. We believe medicine has a place. But medicine has a limitation.”
Tesla’s claims have attracted the interest of federal regulators. In August, the FDA wrote to the company demanding responses to questions about its devices and their supposed medical benefits. Liu said his company takes the letter seriously and is working on its response.
Among other concerns, the FDA questioned the assertions Tesla has made about its devices. The agency declined to comment on the matter. Depending on Tesla’s response, the agency could levy fines or take other punitive actions, including ordering the company to remove its products from the market.
The AP contacted several people who had purchased the products, or whose relatives had, who said they later felt duped. None agreed to speak on the record, citing the fear of public embarrassment. Some angry customers have posted complaints about the products on social media.
“Don’t waste your money, I’ve already wasted mine,” said one woman who uploaded a TikTok video about her experiences with a BioHealer. During the video, the woman opened the container to reveal the interior of the canister: a solid mass that resembled concrete. “They sold me a can of cement.”
Many of the company’s claims ape the language of science, said Caulfield, the Canadian law professor, including technical sounding words like “quantum” or “biophotons” to add to their credibility.
“They sound high-tech and employ the language of technology and medicine, even borrowing the name of Nikola Tesla,” Caulfield said. “It’s designed to enhance their credibility.”
Tesla’s claims about life force energy are also based, somewhat, on fact. Biophotons are real — a type of light emitted by living tissue that can’t be seen by the human eye. But their role in health is not well understood and use as a medical therapy is not proven, according to Bahman Anvari, a professor of bioengineering at the University of California, Riverside.
Tesla is now undertaking a clinical study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the cannisters. For now, the company cites a single medical study written by Liu and three other Tesla employees as evidence to back up its claims. That study found that Tesla’s canisters helped a woman who had complained of severe menstrual pain.
Anvari, however, noted that Tesla’s single journal article was not peer-reviewed, was limited to a single patient who was also receiving standard treatments, lacked a control group and has not been replicated.
“It’s completely scientifically implausible,” Caulfield said. “But if you’re desperate, and you’re looking for answers, you can see why you’d be drawn to it.”"

Life and death in the heat. What it feels like when Earth’s temperatures soar to record highs
The warming Earth sizzled through a week with four of the hottest days ever measured. People across the world suffered how the warmth just wouldn’t fade away at night. Scientists are concerned about the heat records, turbocharged by climate change.

BENI MELLAL, Morocco (AP) — In the unrelenting heat of Morocco’s Middle Atlas, people were sleeping on rooftops. Hanna Ouhbour needed refuge too, but she was outside a hospital waiting for her diabetic cousin who was in a room without air conditioning.
On Wednesday, there were 21 heat-related deaths at Beni Mellal’s main hospital as temperatures spiked to 48.3 degrees (118.9 degrees Fahrenheit) in the region of 575,000 people, most lacking air conditioning.
“We don’t have money and we don’t have a choice,” said Ouhbour, a 31-year-old unemployed woman from Kasba Tadla, an even warmer city that some experts say is among the hottest on Earth.
“The majority of the deaths were among people suffering from chronic diseases and the elderly, as the high temperatures contributed to the deterioration of their health condition and led to their death,” Kamal Elyansli, the regional director of health, said in a statement.
This is life and death in the heat.
As the warming Earth sizzled through a week with four of the hottest days ever measured, the world focused on cold, hard numbers that showed the average daily temperature for the entire planet.
But the 17.16 degrees Celsius (62.8 degrees Fahrenheit) reading recorded on Monday doesn’t convey how oppressively sticky any one particular place became at the peak of sunshine and humidity. The thermometer doesn’t tell the story of warmth that just wouldn’t go away at night so people could sleep.
The records are about statistics, keeping score. But people don’t feel data. They feel the heat.
“We do not need any scientists to tell us what the temperature is outside as this is what our body tells us instantly,” said Humayun Saeed, a 35-year-old roadside fruit seller in Pakistan’s cultural capital of Lahore.
Saeed had to go to the hospital twice in June because of heat stroke.
“The situation is much better now, as it was not easy to work in May and June because of the heat wave, but I have been avoiding the morning walk,” Saeed said. “I may resume it in August when the temperature will go further down.”
The heat was making Delia, a 38-year-old pregnant woman standing outside a Bucharest, Romania, train station, feel even more uncomfortable. Daytime was so hot she was drowsy. With no air conditioning at night, she considered sleeping in her car like a friend had.
“I’ve really noticed a very big increase in temperatures. I think it was the same for everyone. I felt it even more because I am pregnant,” said Delia, who only provided her first name. “But I guess it wasn’t just me. Really everyone felt this.”
Self-described weather nerd Karin Bumbaco was in her element, but then it became just a little too much when Seattle had day after day of much warmer than normal heat.
“I love science. I love the weather. I have since I was a little kid,” said Bumbaco, the deputy state climatologist for Washington. “It’s sort of fun to see daily records get broken. ... But in recent years just living through it and actually feeling the heat has become just more miserable on a day-to-day basis.”
“Like this recent stretch we’ve had. I wasn’t sleeping very well. I don’t have AC at my home,” Bumbaco said. “I was watching the thermostat every morning be a little warmer than the previous warm morning. It was just building up the heat in the house and I just couldn’t wait for it to be over.”
For climate scientists around the world, what had been an academic exercise about climate change literally hit home.
“I’ve been analyzing these numbers from the cool of my office, but the heat has started to affect me as well, causing sleepless nights due to warmer urban temperatures,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune, Maharashtra, which normally has a relatively mild climate.
“My children return home from school during the peak hours exhausted,” Koll said. “Last month one of my colleagues’ mother died from heat stroke in north India.”
Philip Mote, a climate scientist and dean of the graduate school at Oregon State University, had moved in junior high to California’s Central Valley and its triple digit summer heat.
“I pretty quickly figured I didn’t like a hot dry climate,” Mote said. “And that’s why I moved to the Northwest.”
For decades, Mote worked on climate issues from the comfort of Oregon, where people feared that with global warming the Northwest “would be the last nice place to live in the U.S. and everybody would move here and we’d have overpopulation.”
But the region was hit by nasty fires in 2020 and a deadly heat wave in 2021, causing some people to flee what was supposed to be a climate haven.
In the second week of July, the temperature hit 104 degrees (40 Celsius). As a member of a masters’ rowing club, Mote practices on the water Tuesdays and Thursday evenings, but this week they decided to just float down the river in tubes.
In Boise, Idaho, tubing in the heat that has hovered between 99 and 108 degrees Fahrenheit (37 to 42 degrees Celsius) for 17 days has become so popular there’s a 30-minute to an hour wait to get into the water, said John Tullius, general manager for Boise River Raft & Tube.
“I think it’s been record numbers these last 10 days in a row,” Tullius said, adding that he worries about his outdoor workers, especially the physical toll on those who pick up rafts at the end of the trek.
He erected special shade structure for them, added more workers to ease the load and urges them to hydrate.
In Denver’s City Park, the swan-shaped pedal boat rental shop isn’t that busy because it’s beastly hot outside and those brave souls who do go out have to sit on hot fiberglass seats.
There’s not much shade for the workers, “but we do hide in our little shack,” said employee Dominic Prado, 23. “We also have a very strong fan in there that I like to raise my shirt over it just to cool down.”

5543,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-09-24,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the United Nations Security Council on September 24 that Russia can only be ""forced"" into peace, and denounced Iran and North Korea as ""accomplices"" who have helped Moscow by providing weapons it has used in attacks on Ukraine.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ""broken so many international norms and rules that he won't stop on his own, Russia can only be forced into peace, and that is exactly what's needed -- forcing Russia into peace as the sole aggressor in this war, the sole violator of the UN Charter,"" Zelenskiy said.
Zelenskiy said the idea of talking with Putin would be ""insanity"" as he also criticized Russia for making Iran and North Korea ""de facto accomplices in its criminal war in Europe, with their weapons killing us, killing Ukrainians.""
Before the meeting, Russian Ambassador to the UN Vasily Nebenzya said that the Russian delegation did not intend to listen to ""cloned speeches"" criticizing Moscow for its aggression against Ukraine. But Nebenzya did not leave the hall during Zelenskiy's speech.
Zelenskiy earlier on September 24 called on Washington to take ""decisive"" action to bring the end of the war closer as Russia launched a fresh series of strikes on Ukraine's second-largest city, killing three people.
""The targets of the Russian bombs were an apartment building, a bakery, a stadium. In other words, the everyday life of ordinary people,"" Zelenskiy said on X. ""Russia is a terrorist, and it proves this every day with its own actions, with its choice to wage war, and attempts to expand it.""
He posted a picture showing the severely damaged facade of a nine-story apartment building and debris strewn across the street. He said at least three people were killed and 24 injured.
Earlier, regional officials said one man was killed and six were wounded, including two children, by ""massive"" Russian air strikes on the southern city of Zaporizhzhya late on September 23.
Zelenskiy, who is in the United States for the annual United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), met with a bipartisan delegation of U.S. lawmakers, voicing Kyiv's gratitude for what he called Washington's unwavering support for Kyiv and highlighting the critical U.S. role in defending Ukraine's freedom.
RFE/RL's Ukraine Live Briefing gives you the latest developments on Russia's invasion, Western military aid, the plight of civilians, and territorial control maps. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.
The United States, Ukraine's main supporter, and Western allies have given Kyiv billions of dollars in military aid and other assistance while also slapping several rounds of sanctions on Russia.
During his meeting with Senators Ben Cardin (Democrat-Maryland), chairman of the influential Senate Foreign Relations Committee; Dan Sullivan (Republican-Alaska); Christopher Murphy (Democrat-Connecticut); and Representative Gregory Meeks (Democrat-New York), Zelenskiy said he informed the U.S. lawmakers about the current situation of the conflict and Russia's moves.
""Decisive action now could hasten the just end of Russian aggression against Ukraine next year. Our Victory Plan will help bring Russia to peace in practice,"" Zelenskiy said on Telegram after the meeting.
""Now, at the end of the year, we have a real opportunity to strengthen cooperation between Ukraine and the United States,"" he said.
Zelenskiy, who is due to speak at the UNGA on September 25 and then hold talks with U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House lawmakers at the U.S. Capitol on September 26, also held bilateral meetings on the sidelines with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
In an interview with ABC News due to be released in full on September 24, Zelenskiy said that only a ""strong position"" would allow Ukraine to bring Russian President Vladimir Putin ""to stop the war.""
""I think that we are closer to the peace than we think,"" Zelenskiy was quoted as saying in excerpts from the interview. ""We are closer to the end of the war.""
Although Russia occupies some 20 percent of Ukraine's territory and has been advancing toward the strategically important hub of Pokrovsk in the eastern region of Donetsk, Kyiv has taken Moscow by surprise, launching an incursion into Russia's western Kursk region last month and seizing dozens of villages on Russian soil.
The Kursk incursion, Zelenskiy told ABC, exposed Putin's precarious position.
""He's afraid very much,"" Zelenskiy said. ""Why? Because his people saw that he can't defend -- that he can't defend all his territory.""
Russia, however, has kept pounding Ukraine with dozens of drones and missiles.
Ukrainian air defenses shot down 66 of the 81 drones launched by Russia at eight regions on September 24, the Ukrainian Air Force reported on Telegram, adding that Moscow also fired four missiles during the early morning attack.
The Russian strikes targeted the Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Cherkasy, Vinnytsya, Kirovohrad, Poltava, Sumy, and Mykolayiv regions, the air force said. Separately, regional authorities in the eastern region of Poltava said the Russian attack damaged energy infrastructure.
Russia's Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said its air defenses destroyed 13 Ukrainian drones overnight over the Belgorod, Kursk, and Bryansk regions."
5740,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-10-20,"Russia’s military launched another wave of missiles and drones across Ukraine, Ukrainian officials said on October 20, with an energy installation hit and multiple injuries reported in another strike.
The Russian attack came as officials in Russia reported a large Ukrainian drone strike that appeared to target an industrial park where a key defense contractor plant is located.
Seventeen people, including a rescue worker, were reported injured after Russia’s military fired ballistic missiles on Kryviy Rih in the southern region of Dnipropetrovsk. Eight of the injured were hospitalized, according to Oleksandr Vilkul, chairman of the Kryviy Rih defense council.
Fifteen residential buildings, as well as several educational institutions and administrative buildings, were damaged in the city some 400 kilometers southeast of Kyiv.
In the eastern city of Kharkiv, a district was hit by a Grom-EI missile, RBK-Ukraine writes, quoting the regional prosecutor's office. The Grom-EI is a hybrid of a missile and a gliding aviation bomb. Based on the Soviet-era Kh-38 air-to-surface missile, it reportedly has a range up to 120 kilometers.
Russia also attacked an energy facility in the northeastern Sumy region, the regional power operator Sumyoblenerho said on Telegram.
""As a result, more than 37,000 consumers in the Romny region (104 settlements) are temporarily without electricity supply,"" it said.
Kyiv is bracing for its toughest winter of the war yet, with Moscow having destroyed much of its generating capacity and continuing to strike energy sites. Such strikes on civilian infrastructure are considered war crimes.
According to the Energy Ministry, Russia has carried out more than 1,000 strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure facilities since October 2022.
About 10 drones were destroyed near Kyiv, the city's military administration said on the Telegram messaging app. There were no reports of destruction or injuries, it said.
Air alerts were declared twice in the capital during the night, lasting about three hours in total. The Lviv region near the Polish border was also the target of a drone attack, with no damage reported by early on October 20, Reuters reported.
Ukrainian air defenses destroyed 31 out of 49 drones launched by Russian forces in their latest overnight strike across various parts of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Air Force said on October 20.
It added that 13 drones had been ""locationally lost"" and that two had flown into neighboring Belarus."
5379,real,ANTI_MIGRATION_AND_XENOPHOBIA,2024-04-08,"New Zealand will tighten its visa rules for some migrants in a bid to reduce overall immigration numbers, as the island country's has in recent years have seen ""unsustainable"" levels of migration, according to Immigration Minister Erica Standford.
Stanford announced changes on Sunday to the Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV) program, the country's primary temporary work visa program, which she said would ensure that New Zealand can still attract the skilled workers it needs while also reducing the vulnerability of migrants to exploitation.
The AEWV was introduced in mid-2022 to help fill workforce shortages in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In 2023, however, migration swelled to a near record of 173,000 new non-New Zealand citizens taking up residence. At the same time, New Zealanders have been moving out of the country. Last year, the country saw a record loss of 47,000 citizens.
""Getting our immigration settings right is critical to this government's plan to rebuild the economy,"" Stanford said, adding that while there were still skill shortages in some areas, the government had to ""ensure that New Zealanders are put to the front of the line for jobs where there are no skill shortages.""
""We had to make some changes now because we've got high migrant exploitation and unsustainable numbers coming into the country,"" Stanford said according to state broadcaster Radio New Zealand. ""So there are some things that we needed to do immediately.""
Changes to the visa program include the introduction of English language requirements for low-skilled jobs and setting a minimum skills and work experience threshold for most employer work visas. The maximum continuous stay for most low-skilled roles has also been reduced from five years to three years.
Officials also decided to axe earlier plans to add 11 roles, including welders, fitters and turners, to the list of occupations that would qualify for a fast track to residency.
Employers will need to ensure that migrants meet the requirements before hiring them, and they're required to ensure that no ""suitable and available New Zealander"" applied for the job before it was offered to a non-New Zealander.
Stanford said many of the changes were not actually new, but rather a ""return to pre-pandemic settings that better balanced the needs of businesses with the wider interests of New Zealand.""
Some roles in the transport and care sectors will be exempt from the requirements."
5819,fake,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-04-02,"04/02/2024 / By Laura Harris
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recently set stringent emissions standards for heavy-duty trucks, buses and other large vehicles to “combat climate change.”
The new rules, set to take effect for vehicles made in model years 2027 through 2032, apply to commercial vehicles like cement mixers, garbage trucks, RVs, ambulances and school buses. Under these guidelines, a substantial portion of long-haul trucks and medium-sized trucks, such as landscaping vehicles and box trucks, must transition to non-polluting alternatives by 2032. Specifically, 25 percent of long-haul trucks and 40 percent of medium-size trucks should be non-polluting within the next decade. (Related: New, aggressive EPA emissions restrictions for gas-powered cars could force them to be phased out by 2032.)
Manufacturers are already planning different strategies to meet these cleaner standards, with options ranging from using zero-emission batteries to hydrogen fuel cells.
With that, the EPA projects that the limits will eliminate a staggering one billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions, thereby bolstering public health and mitigating the impacts of climate change. The regulations are expected to yield $13 billion in net benefits, including reduced hospital visits, fewer lost work days and a decrease in fatalities associated with air pollution-related illnesses.
“Heavy-duty vehicles are essential for moving goods and services throughout our country, keeping our economy moving. They’re also significant contributors to pollution from the transportation sector – emissions that are fueling climate change and creating poor air quality in too many American communities,” said EPA Administrator Michael Regan.

“Reducing emissions from our heavy-duty vehicles means cleaner air and less pollution. It means safer and more vibrant communities. It means lower fuel and maintenance costs for truck owners and operators. And it means healthier Americans,” he added.
Harold Wimmer, the CEO of the American Lung Association, supported the claims of Regan. He claims that the newly imposed emissions limits would deliver immediate health advantages, particularly in communities heavily impacted by dense truck traffic.
“Transportation is the largest source of pollution driving climate change,” he said. “These strong standards that will help drive toward a zero-emission future for trucks, buses and other heavy-duty vehicles are a critical part of the solution.”
Industry groups have voiced strong opposition to the new regulations.
“The EPA is setting unachievable emission reduction targets, this time targeting heavy-duty trucks which are responsible for an enormous portion of freight movement in the United States,” said American Energy Alliance President Thomas Pyle.
“The technology needed to electrify the trucking industry is nowhere near ready, and this rule is setting us on a collision course for supply chain disasters,” Pyle continued. “By increasing the cost of shipping with this rule, the Biden administration is once again demonstrating their lack of concern for American families who have been hit hard by inflation and the onslaught of rules and regulations that are making it increasingly difficult to do business in the United States.”
Similarly, the American Trucking Association argued that the new rules are just unattainable given the current technology and infrastructure limitations.
“The post-2030 targets remain entirely unachievable,” said CEO Chris Spear. “Any regulation that fails to account for the operational realities of trucking will set the industry and America’s supply chain up for failure.”
Meanwhile, other groups claim that the rule heavily favors zero-emission vehicles.
Todd Spencer, the president of the Independent Drivers Association representing small trucking companies, accused the Biden administration of destroying local businesses with an onslaught of impractical environmental regulations.
In a joint statement with the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, the American Petroleum Institute, the leading lobbying group for the oil and gas industry, labeled it as another attempt to limit options for American consumers, businesses and industries.
These organizations urged Congress to overturn the rule and proclaimed their readiness to challenge it in court if necessary.

5922,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-10-18,"The venues could hardly have been more conspicuous: a concert in the capital by the country's most popular rock group, a high-end resort, and a weekend wedding in downtown Lviv.
Military recruiters showed up at these events, among many others across Ukraine in recent days, looking for men who had not registered for service under a long-debated and highly controversial military mobilization law that was adopted last spring.
In some cases, the result was dramatic. Footage shot outside the Okean Elzy concert at Kyiv's Palace of Sports on October 11 showed officers dragging a man in civilian clothes across the pavement as he shouted in protest and onlookers chanted ""Shame!""
It was a glaring example of two worlds colliding in Ukraine, where deadly battles grind on along the 1,200-kilometer front line as Russia's full-scale invasion heads toward its fourth year with little sign of an end in sight, and where life -- even nightlife -- goes on despite the missile and drone attacks that hit cities and towns nationwide.
""Half the country is crying and half the country is jumping [for joy],"" Oleksiy Haran, a political science professor and research director at the Kyiv-based Democratic Initiatives foundation, told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service, using a phrase that rhymes in Ukrainian to accentuate the divide between soldiers at the front and civilians living relatively carefree lives in wartime.
In its existential effort to ward off Moscow's onslaught, Ukraine faces multiple challenges. A key city in the Donbas could fall soon as Russian forces advance with the help of air superiority. Russian attacks on power and energy infrastructure could make for a particularly hard winter. And the future of crucial Western support – when it comes to weapons, financial aid, and diplomatic backing -- is clouded by the upcoming U.S. election and disagreements among EU members.
A Deadly Numbers Game
But the recruitment raids point to a problem that ""has grown to incredible proportions,"" said Kyiv-based political analyst Oleksiy Koshel: A dire need for more soldiers on the front lines. It's a problem that is Kyiv's to solve, and one whose effects reverberate far from the battlefield, exacerbating rifts in society when the last thing Ukraine needs is disunity.
Manpower is a problem for Russia, too, as Moscow's military makes ""pretty modest advances at an enormous cost in men and equipment,"" said Ruth Deyermond, senior lecturer in the Department of War Studies at King's College London. But it's ""more obviously acute in the case of Ukraine.""
""There are not enough people at the front -- that is an absolute fact,"" Ukrainian military analyst Pavlo Narozhniy told RFE/RL. ""There is a shortage of personnel in absolutely all units.""
To illustrate the point, he described a scenario at the front: ""We have an observation post or a defense point that should have 30 people on duty, but in reality there may be five to seven there…. And 30-40 Russians are attacking, and these five to seven have to hold back the attack by 30-40. Because there aren't enough people,"" he said. ""There are simply no people -- they're gone.""
Ukraine's army ""can never win the numbers game against an adversary like Russia, with a far greater population and a leadership that is prepared to pay a very high blood price for its war aims,"" Simon Schlegel, senior Ukraine analyst at the Crisis Group, said in an e-mailed comment.
This was not a worry in the first year of Russia's full-scale invasion, which started in February 2022. In the beginning, ""Volunteers formed long lines outside recruitment centers and often brought their own equipment and organized their own training,"" Schlegel said. In 2023, however, the ""abundant stream of volunteers dried up.""
The mobilization law is part of a series of efforts this year to get the number up. Among other things, it required men aged 25 to 60 to update their personal data at military-run recruitment centers or civilian administrative offices, or on a government app, Reserve+.
""That led to a much better overview over what kind of reserve Kyiv can rely on. That reserve, perhaps some 3.7 million conscripts, is much bigger than the maybe 200,000 soldiers Kyiv is hoping to mobilize this year,"" Schlegel said. ""And intake seems to have grown considerably over the summer.""
'Wild Mobilization'
But there are plenty of problems, ranging from obstacles to effective training -- for one thing, many soldiers who are qualified to train are dead or fighting at the front -- to corruption that enables men to avoid service through bribes and other machinations.
There are also disincentives to serve, including the fact that the mobilization law does not set out rules for demobilization or rotation. That has left potential recruits concerned that, like exhausted soldiers who have been fighting with little or no respite since 2022 or 2023, once they're in they may never get out alive.
But more and more are trying to do just that: An October 15 report in the media outlet Ukrayinska Pravda cited the Prosecutor-General's Office as saying nearly 18,300 desertion cases were registered in January-September of this year, four times more than over the same period in 2023. AWOL cases were also way up, it said.
Forceful efforts to bring men into the military or summon them to register -- sometimes called ""wild mobilization"" -- have been happening since long before the new law was passed. Since the first full winter of the all-out war, videos showing recruiters handing out draft notices in aggressive, tricky, sometimes violent ways have surfaced online with some frequency.
As Ukraine's manpower problem has intensified, so has the public debate. In a poll by the Kyiv-based Razumkov Center in late June, nearly half the respondents -- 46 percent -- said there is ""no shame in evading military service,"" while 29 percent said that there is.
The raid outside the Okean Elzy concert touched a nerve at a sensitive time for Ukraine, with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy seeking to sell Ukrainians and Kyiv's foreign backers on a ""victory plan"" that would require stepped-up Western support and a NATO membership invitation before the war ends.
The incident attracted outsized attention in part because Okean Elzy front man Svyatoslav Vakarchuk is a celebrity spanning culture and politics -- a rock star and former lawmaker who founded the opposition party Holos (Voice) in 2019.
Footage of the scuffle between recruiters and civilians went viral and prompted vocal reactions on both sides of the divide over military service and the methods used to increase manpower at the front.
""They're taking everyone indiscriminately,"" a man in the northern city of Chernihiv told RFE/RL. ""And where do they send them -- to their deaths? I think that is wrong.""
Another Chernihiv resident disagreed. ""I believe this is the duty of every man,"" he said. ""I've served since 2015. I've fought in two wars. So, I think it's the duty of every Ukrainian man.""
For others, it's more about the methods.
""On the one hand, it seems that we need to replenish our army and help them [to rotate out]. On the other hand, I don't like the way they are doing it,"" one woman said.
'We Want To Dance While You Fight'
Mobilization methods pitting military recruiters who are in some cases wounded combat veterans against civilians at leisure make for ""an explosive mix,"" Ukrainian parliament deputy Oleksiy Honcharenko told Current Time.
""They've lost their brothers-in-arms and their health, and here they are on the big-city streets where life is bubbling along, where there are restaurants, clubs, concerts.""
""This is wrong, the system [of recruitment centers] should be entirely civilian,"" Honcharenko said. ""And all this creates tension in Ukrainian society, of course.""
In a Facebook post, servicewoman Lesya Hanzha suggested that the cries of ""Shame!"" addressed to recruiters and police outside the concert venue were signs of ""a society that confuses shame with honor"" -- a rift between the military and ordinary citizens on the one hand and a privileged, condescending elite on the other.
""[It] sounds to me like a message of 'You are losers and we're not. We want to dance while you fight, and we think that's okay.' Open chutzpah that's passed off as human rights,"" she wrote.
Confrontations like the one outside the Okean Elzy concert also open a window for Russian propaganda, according to the state-supported Center for Countering Disinformation. It said Russian media and pro-Kremlin bloggers have used the developments to play up the narratives that mobilization is unfair in Ukraine and that the government ""wants to fight to the last Ukrainian.""
But the manpower problem eclipses any threat from Russian propaganda, analysts suggest.
If the dynamics of mobilization don't change, the prospects are grim, Narozhniy told RFE/RL: A ""catastrophe"" is unlikely, but ""we will constantly be retreating in the areas where the enemy is advancing.""
""Yes, they are advancing slowly; yes, they are gaining a few dozen meters a day -- but it is still a creeping offensive. It's like gangrene that eats away at a person, and in our case, unfortunately, it's eating away at our country,"" he said.
""If things don't change and this negative trend continues, we will lose our country and our people."""
6075,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-09-12,"The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has condemned an attack that killed three of its workers who were distributing aid in the frontline Donetsk region of Ukraine.
Ukrainian presidential officials said earlier that Russian forces had attacked Red Cross vehicles in an artillery strike that also wounded two other Red Cross workers.
RFE/RL's Ukraine Live Briefing gives you the latest developments on Russia's invasion, Western military aid, the plight of civilians, and territorial control maps. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.
""Another Russian war crime. Today, the occupier attacked vehicles of the International Committee of the Red Cross humanitarian mission in the Donetsk region,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on X, formerly Twitter. ""In this war, everything is absolutely clear -- Russia sows evil, Ukraine defends life.""
Miryjana Spoljaric, the president of the ICRC, condemned the attack in a statement on September 12 which confirmed that three of the organization's workers had been killed by shelling that hit the site of a planned frontline aid distribution point in the Donetsk region.
""I condemn attacks on Red Cross personnel in the strongest terms,"" Spoljaric said on X. ""It's unconscionable that shelling would hit an aid distribution site. Our hearts are broken today as we mourn the loss of our colleagues and care for the injured. This tragedy unleashes a wave of grief all too familiar to those who have lost loved ones in armed conflict.""
The statement added that ICRC teams are regularly present in the Donetsk region, and their vehicles are marked with the Red Cross emblem.
Photos released by local police showed a truck with the ICRC emblem on its side engulfed in flames.
Earlier on September 12, Donetsk Governor Vadym Filashkin reported that three people were killed and two injured in the village of Virolyubivka in the Kostyantynivka district.
""The village came under artillery fire this morning. One of the shells hit the territory of the enterprise where people were. A truck with humanitarian aid and a car were destroyed,"" he said.
ICRC employees had brought fuel briquettes to residents for heating before winter. They were unloading the aid when the attack happened, the Prosecutor-General's Office said later on Telegram.
One of the two employees who were injured in the strike is in serious condition, the Prosecutor-General's Office added."
3819,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-06-24,"Long-term loneliness associated with higher risk of stroke: Study
Those who experienced chronic loneliness had a 56% higher risk of stroke.
Middle-age and older adults with long-term loneliness are at higher risk of stroke than those who do not report being lonely, according to a new study published in the journal eClinicalMedicine on Monday.
Researchers found the risk of stroke among lonely adults was higher regardless of co-existing depressive symptoms or feelings of social isolation.
""Loneliness is increasingly considered a major public health issue. Our findings further highlight why that is,"" lead author Yenee Soh, a research associate in the department of social and behavioral sciences at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said in a press release.
""Especially when experienced chronically, our study suggests loneliness may play an important role in stroke incidence, which is already one of the leading causes of long-term disability and mortality worldwide,"" Soh continued.
Those who experienced situational loneliness -- a temporary loneliness due to a change in circumstances -- did not have an increased stroke risk, suggesting that the impact of loneliness on stroke risk occurs in the long term, according to the study,
The study used data from the University of Michigan's Health and Retirement Study (HRS) survey that followed nearly 9,000 stroke-free adults who were aged 50 or older for 10 to 12 years.
Results showed those who experienced chronic loneliness had a 56% higher risk of stroke than those who consistently reported not being lonely, independent of social isolation, depressive symptoms, body mass index, physical activity and other health conditions.
Previous research has linked loneliness to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, but the new study is one of the first large-scale, long-term studies to examine the association between loneliness changes and stroke risk over time.
""These study findings are consistent with other research that has shown that loneliness has been linked to [poorer] health,"" Dr. Julianne Holt-Lunstad, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Brigham Young University and eminent researcher on the health effects of loneliness -- who was not involved with the study -- told ABC News.
""It's also consistent with other research that shows that the detrimental effects seem to be most associated when it is persistent or chronic over time,"" she continued. ""This study because it looked at loneliness at multiple times to determine whether there were changes, and whether it was consistent over time [and] found that persistent levels were associated with the worst outcomes.""
Participants who only had baseline measurements of loneliness saw an occurrence of 1,237 strokes during the follow-up period from 2006 to 2018. Participants who completed two loneliness assessments and reported loneliness both times saw an occurrence of 601 strokes during the same follow-up period.
Each group's stroke risk was analyzed in the context of their loneliness while controlling for other health and behavioral risk factors, including social isolation and depressive symptoms, which are closely related to -- but distinct from -- loneliness.
""Repeat assessments of loneliness may help identify those who are chronically lonely and are therefore at a higher risk for stroke,"" Soh said in the press release. ""If we fail to address their feelings of loneliness, on a micro and macro scale, there could be profound health consequences.""
""Importantly, these interventions must specifically target loneliness, which is a subjective perception and should not be conflated with social isolation,"" she added.

2466,real,INSTITUTIONAL_AND_MEDIA_DISTRUST_PUBLIC_INSTITUTIONS,2024-06-06,"Estonians can cast their ballots across six days that started Monday, but the Netherlands is the only EU country to start its single-day vote so early, followed by Ireland on Friday and the rest of the EU nations over the weekend. Europe-wide results will be announced Sunday night after all member states have completed voting.
The Dutch voting comes six months after Geert Wilders’ far-right Party for Freedom sent shockwaves around Europe by becoming the biggest party in the Dutch national parliament. Polling suggests Wilders will build on that popularity and set the tone for much of the bloc.
Since the last EU elections five years ago, populist, far-right and extremist parties are leading governments in three EU nations, are part of governing coalitions in several others, and appear to have surging public support across the continent.
The EU elections are the world’s second-biggest exercise in democracy behind the election in India, and the stakes are high.
Almost 400 million voters will be electing 720 members of the European Parliament from beyond the Arctic circle to the edges of Africa and Asia. They will have an impact on issues ranging from global climate policies and defense to migration and geopolitical relations with China and the United States.
Since the last European elections in 2019, war has broken out on the fringe of the bloc following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a country that desperately wants to join the EU.

A founding member, the Netherlands was long unwavering in its support of EU policies. Research from the Clingendael think tank, though, suggests dissatisfaction with the EU among Dutch people, and that while most believe that the Netherlands should remain in the bloc, many also believe it should be more self-sufficient.
While many voters are predicted to lurch to the right, the Christian Democrat-dominated European People’s Party led by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, is currently the EU legislature’s biggest bloc and is bound to be the coalition kingmaker when the dust settles on the election results.
In the Netherlands, Wilders’ PVV could build on its domestic success and surge, possibly overtaking the combined Labor Party and Green Left. Labor topped the Dutch EU Parliament election in 2019 with 19% of the vote for six seats while the Greens took 11% and three seats. Wilders’ party at the time only managed 3.5% and no seats.
Wilders and one of his likely coalition partners, the Farmer Citizen Movement, are popular among farmers in the Netherlands who have staged regular protests to call for an easing of EU legislation they say is crippling their livelihoods.
Wilders has in the past called for the Netherlands to leave the EU as Britain did, but his party’s manifesto for the election starting Thursday makes no mention of a so-called Nexit. Instead, it urges voters to back the PVV so it can change the EU from within, similar to plans of many other hard right parties across the bloc.
The number of members elected in each country depends on the size of the population. It ranges from six for Malta, Luxembourg and Cyprus to 96 for Germany. In 2019, Europeans elected 751 lawmakers. Following the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU in 2020, the number of MEPs fell to 705. Some of the 73 seats previously held by British MEPs had been redistributed to other member states.
The lawmakers, known as Members of the European Parliament or MEPs, can vote on a wide range of legislation relating to climate, banking rules, agriculture, fisheries, security and justice. They also vote on the EU budget, which is crucial to the implementation of European policies, including, for instance, the aid delivered to Ukraine.
After the election, MEPs will elect their president at the first plenary session, from July 16-19. Then, most likely in September, they will nominate the president of the European Commission, following a proposal made by the member states. In 2019, von der Leyen narrowly won a vote to become the first woman to head the institution.

6107,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-05-30,"Despite increased potential in some countries, hydroelectric plants are having to contend with more extreme conditions.
Europe was around seven per cent wetter than average in 2023 - during the world’s hottest year on record.
Hot air retains more moisture, which increases precipitation and can cause widespread flooding. One third of rivers across Europe breached a ‘high’ flood threshold last year, according to the EU climate agency’s latest report.
In some areas, fuller rivers strengthened the hand of one renewable: hydropower. Potential for run-of-river hydropower generation was above average across much of Europe for the year as a whole, Copernicus says.
With this form of hydropower, a portion of the river is diverted through a canal or a penstock to spin a turbine and generate electricity.
But does a wetter Europe necessarily lead to more hydropower? Here’s what the experts say.
Will Europe be wetter due to climate change?
First things first, is Europe’s wet weather trend expected to continue?
According to climate scientists, extreme precipitation is set to increase with global warming across most of Europe, except the Mediterranean. There will be more rainfall during northern European winters and less in Mediterranean summers.
This mixed picture emerged last year, with Spain, Portugal and southern France drier than average.
Increased rainfall and flooding is only one consequence of throwing our water cycle into disarray. A 1-in-500 year drought hit Europe in 2022, denting hydropower generation.
Neither extreme is good for run-of-river hydropower. Low flow conditions mean there is too little water to generate sufficient electricity, while flood events risk damaging the equipment.
But, explains Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) scientist Shaun Harrigan, “in regions and seasons where river flow increases moderately, then there would be increased hydropower generation potential.”
So that could mean more run-of-river hydropower - the kind that is more directly linked to climate variability - in parts of northwest Europe.
Which European countries have the most hydropower?
Europe’s network of hydropower plants delivered 637.23 terawatt hours (TWh) of renewable energy in 2023, according to the International Hydropower Association (IHA). That's enough to cover around 163.4 million European households.
French and Portuguese utility companies Électricité de France (EDF) and Energias de Portugal (EDP) are the “biggest hitters” in Europe, while the UK has recently committed to developing more pumped storage hydropower (PSH).
PSH is described as the world’s largest battery. It pumps water from a lower source to an upper reservoir and releases it through a turbine during times of high electricity demand. And it’s this technology that the industry is investing most of its hopes in.
“The greatest challenges for the European grid are modernisation of [existing] plants and the potential for their conversion into pumped storage facilities to support management of a flexible grid powered by a mixture of hydropower, wind and solar,” a spokesperson for IHA says.
Although there is some potential left for run-of-river systems, they say, like in the Danube River, the time is ripe for PSH growth. Austria is considered a leader in constructing these water batteries. In Albania, Norwegian energy giant Statkraft is planning to expand its hydropower fleet on the Devoll river cascade, by adding a new PSH facility.
Can hydropower plants withstand worse flooding?
In August last year, days of heavy rain overwhelmed the Braskereidfoss hydroelectric power plant on Norway’s mighty Glåma River. Its concrete dam partially collapsed, leading to further flooding and the displacement of some 5,000 people downstream.
But the IHA maintains that hydropower is one of the most climate-resilient forms of electricity.
“In many locations, increased water flow can be better managed through powered infrastructure such as hydropower, thanks to its water retention capabilities,” an IHA spokesperson tells Euronews Green.
“Not only are most facilities robust for many decades, most dams are built as flood and drought control plus irrigation.”
Modernisation is key, they add, as “a more flexible plant is a more resilient one.”
In the case of the Norwegian power plant, hatches that were supposed to open automatically if too much water collected behind the dam failed to work as designed.
With climate extremes increasing in such a variable way across Europe, the required upgrades can vary even between the same type of hydropower plants in different countries.
“Modern technologies such as digitalisation, improved forecasting and satellite monitoring, hybridisation and variable speed turbines, will help the sector navigate extreme meteorological conditions,” the IHA spokesperson explains.
“Facilities equipped with larger reservoirs, capable of storing substantial volumes of water such as reservoir and pumped storage hydropower, will play a crucial role in mitigating the effect of extreme events such as drought and flooding.”
How can hydropower plants be sustainable?
While there might be more potential for ‘water batteries’, especially in northwest Europe, not everyone is convinced it’s the best route to clean energy.
Environmentalists are concerned about the impact of new dams on Europe’s waterways, pointing out that the ecosystems it impinges on are not renewable.
“Europe has the most fragmented rivers in the world,” Claire Baffert, Senior Water Policy Advisor at WWF Europe previously told us, explaining that migratory fish are particularly impacted. “And this is because of all the dams that have been built for hydropower.”
To help buff the green credentials of hydropower projects, the Hydropower Sustainability Alliance has developed a global certification scheme that the industry can check itself against.
Plans should avoid negative biodiversity impacts, for example, and take water supplies into account.
Even the best-laid plans, however, are being projected into an increasingly unstable future.
“Climate change is having a profound impact on the water cycle,” C3S scientist Harrigan says.
“While we might be able to limit or even reverse some disruption, some changes might be irreversible - we do not yet fully understand the consequences of pushing the water cycle into unchartered territory.”"
6013,fake,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-10-29,"10/29/2024 / By Cassie B.
Renewable energy sources like wind and solar are often touted as the way of the future and something that will help us enjoy all the power we need without hurting the environment.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
In fact, this “next big thing” is actually a throwback to another era – one when people did not enjoy the health and quality of life that we do now.
Take a look at 1800, when humans used more than 450 times less energy than they do now, nearly all of which was sourced from biomass. At that time, our life expectancy wasn’t even 40 years, while malnutrition and illness kept people from growing. Our fortunes didn’t start turning around until coal was used at scale.
However, the use of wind as a source of energy actually goes back much further. It was used to power sailboats in Mesopotamia, assisting transportation until the Persians developed the first windmills to pump water and grind grain somewhere between 500 and 900 A.D. and eventually becoming widespread throughout Europe in the 17th century.
Was it a smart idea? Absolutely. It meant people could accomplish more. But some of the drawbacks that drove societies away from wind power are the same ones this “green energy” source is facing today, chief among them is the inability to store it. That’s why its use was limited back then to pumping water into livestock tanks, milling grain into flour, and sawing lumber into boards.
Another problem that wind energy advocates seem to overlook is the lack of reliability. Wind energy depends on the weather, and you always need a backup or you won’t be able to do whatever needs to be done when the weather isn’tt going in your favor. Back then, horses had to provide power to mill grain when wind wasn’t cooperating; these days, natural gas power plants generate electricity on days without the wind needed to keep the world going.
In other words, while renewable energy may have been quite useful at its time for raising the standard of living, it was — and still is — plagued with reliability and availability problems that make it completely inadequate as the sole solution to humanity’s energy needs.
Coal is often maligned today in some circles, but without it, we wouldn’t have had the industrial revolution. It could be transported and used wherever it was needed, unlike wind or water power, and it can burn around the clock regardless of the weather. Natural gas and oil eventually joined it, and the era of electricity changed everything once again. These days, none of us can imagine our lives without it.
Unfortunately, wind and solar just don’t produce very much of it. Their energy return on investment is extremely low. There is no future there.
This is something Californians learned the hard way in 2020, when decades of legislation forcing wind and solar power as a source for the electric grid came back to haunt them with rolling power outages during a heat wave that affected millions of people.
If wind and solar power aren’t the solution to our energy needs, what is? Many experts identify nuclear power as the real superstar of the future.
Climate Depot reports that if all the electricity a person used for 70 years came from nuclear facilities, the uranium that is needed to generate it would be smaller than the size of a can of soda. It is this remarkable energy density that means it can provide electricity for cheaper than fossil fuels – and without producing carbon dioxide.

5919,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-05-17,"'This wouldn't be happening without climate change', said the head of the United States' Coral Reef Watch Program
Ocean temperatures that have gone “crazy haywire” could make the current global coral bleaching the worst in history.
It's so bad that scientists are hoping for a few hurricanes as they cool the oceans.
More than three-fifths - 62.9% - of the world's coral reefs are badly hurting from a bleaching event that began last year and is continuing.
That's nearing the record of 65.7% in 2017, when from 2009 to 2017 about one-seventh of the world's coral died, says Derek Manzello, coordinator of the US's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coral Reef Watch Program.
When water gets too hot, coral, which are living creatures, bleach and sometimes die.
How bad is coral bleaching in the Atlantic?
In the Atlantic, off the Florida coast and in the Caribbean, about 99.7% of the coral reefs have been hit with ""very very severe'' losses in staghorn and elkhorn species, Manzello said Thursday in NOAA's monthly climate briefing.
62 countries are seeing damaged coral, with Thailand shutting off a tourist-laden island to try to save the coral there.
Meteorologists say a La Nina - a natural cooling of parts of the Pacific that changes the weather worldwide - is forecast to develop soon and perhaps cool oceans a bit, but Manzello said it may be too little and too late.
“I still am very worried about the state of the world's coral reefs just because we're seeing things play out right now that are just very unexpected and extreme,” Manzello said.
“This wouldn't be happening without climate change. That's basically the cornerstone of all the ocean warming we're seeing,” Manzello said.
On top of that are changes in El Nino, the reverse of La Nina and a natural warming of ocean waters; reduced sulfur pollution from ships and an undersea volcano eruption.
Former top NASA climate scientist James Hansen said “acceleration of global warming is now hard to deny"" in a new analysis and statement Thursday.
Why scientists are hoping for hurricanes
For coral, it comes down to how hot the water is and “things have just gone crazy haywire with ocean temperatures in the last year,” Manzello said. He said hurricanes bring up cool water from deep and benefit coral reefs if they don't hit them directly.
“Hurricanes can be devastating for reefs,” Manzello. “But in the grand scheme of things and given the current situation we are in on planet Earth, they're now a good thing essentially, which is kind of mind-blowing.”
On Wednesday, parts of the Atlantic where hurricanes often develop had an ocean heat content - which measures water warmth at depths - equivalent to mid-August, said hurricane researchers Brian McNoldy at the University of Miami and Phil Klotzbach at Colorado State University.
The world's oceans last month broke a record for the hottest April on record. It was the 13th straight month global seas broke records, and because the oceans are slow to cool or warm, more records are likely, said Karin Gleason, NOAA's climate monitoring chief.
Why are coral reefs critical?
Coral reefs are key to seafood production and tourism worldwide. Scientific reports have long said loss of coral is one of the big tipping points of future warming as the world nears 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial time. That's a limit that countries agreed to try to hold to in the 2015 Paris climate agreement.
“This is one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet,” said Andrew Pershing, a biological oceanographer who is vice president for science of Climate Central. “It's an ecosystem that we're literally going to watch disappear in our lifetimes.”"
5187,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-06-28,"Almost Half of the World Sees Their Area as Gay-Friendly
Nordic countries among the most accepting places
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Nearly half of people worldwide (45%) viewed their city or area as a “good place” for gay or lesbian people to live in 2023. Nearly as many, 44%, said it is “not a good place.”
Acceptance is down from levels between 2020 and 2022, when it hovered around 50%, but it is still more than double the 21% first measured in 2006.
Nordic countries, including Norway (92%), Iceland (90%), Sweden (89%) and Denmark (86%), continue to rank among the most accepting places in the world. Other European countries -- including Spain (89%), the Netherlands (88%) and Malta (87%) -- also top the list, as does Australia (85%).
Nepal (87%), which became the first country in South Asia to recognize same-sex marriage in 2023, remains the only non-Western country among the most accepting nations.
Perceptions of acceptance remain lowest in African and Middle Eastern countries, including several where consensual same-sex sexual acts are illegal, such as Senegal (1%), Gambia (3%), Malawi (4%), Zambia (5%), and Lebanon (5%).
Mozambique Now One of the Most Gay-Friendly Countries in Africa
Between 2022 and 2023, people in 11 countries became more likely to see their area as a good place for gay or lesbian people to live.
This perception increased most in Mozambique, where a new high of 49% say their area is a good place for gay people, up from 36% in 2022.
When Gallup first asked this question in 2006, relatively few Mozambicans (8%) perceived their area as hospitable to gay people, in line with figures recorded in most African countries at that point. Since decriminalizing gay and lesbian relations in 2015, perceptions have become more favorable almost every year. Today, Mozambique is among the most accepting nations in Africa, just behind South Africa (54%).
Double-digit increases were also recorded in Comoros -- where 26% now say it is a good place, up from 16% in 2022 -- and in Malaysia, where 19% say it is a good place, up from 9%.
Perceptions in Belgium (84%) increased by six percentage points, placing it among the 10 most accepting nations in the world in 2023. Increases in Lao People’s Democratic Republic (54%) and Greece (51%) each mark new highs, with majorities in both countries now perceiving their area as a good place for gay or lesbian people.
Record highs were also recorded in Cyprus (49%), the Dominican Republic (44%) and Japan (42%). Eastern European countries Slovakia (39%) and Albania (15%) also registered increases in the percentage saying their area is accepting.
Acceptance Drops in a Dozen Countries
Adults in about a dozen countries became less likely to view their area as hospitable for gay or lesbian people in 2023, with a sharp drop in India that contributed to the lower global average. The current 43% recorded in India, the first figure below the 50% mark since 2019, comes as the nation’s Supreme Court declined to make same-sex marriage legal, punting the issue to the Parliament. However, rather than shifting to believing their area is not a good place for gay or lesbian people to live, more people in India said they did not know or had no opinion.
The decline in the global average may also have been influenced by a six-point decrease in China from Gallup’s previous measure in 2021 (which was included in the 2022 global average). In 2023, 41% of Chinese residents said their area is a good place for gay or lesbian people, down from 47% in 2021.
Double-digit decreases in perceptions of acceptance were recorded in Bangladesh (60%) and South Africa (54%) -- though majorities in both countries still perceive their area as a good place for gay people to live.
Meanwhile, Canada (83%) and Italy (68%) remain among the world’s most accepting places despite six-point decreases in the percentage saying “good place” in both countries. Smaller majorities perceive acceptance in Colombia (52%) and Singapore (51%) despite decreases in each country.
The remaining decreases recorded were in nations where perceptions of acceptance were already low, including Lithuania (25%), Benin (13%), Tanzania (9%), Mauritania (7%) and Mali (6%).
Bottom Line
Perceptions of acceptance of gay and lesbian people vary greatly around the world and change over time, often coinciding with developments in a region’s gay rights movement.
Residents’ views of their area’s hospitability have, over time, generally trended toward more positive environments for gay people to live. However, increases in acceptance are never guaranteed to be lasting, as is the case for a dozen countries in Gallup’s latest update.
How residents answer Gallup’s question, fielded since 2006, may not reflect their personal attitudes toward homosexuality but more so their assessment of the area as a place to live for a marginalized group. And their responses are often influenced by social and political victories and losses for the LGBTQ+ communities there.

2292,real,ANTI_MIGRATION_AND_XENOPHOBIA,2024-06-07,"The number of unaccompanied children making dangerous journeys across the Channel to seek asylum in the last three years has increased threefold.
Kent county council (KCC) data shared with the Guardian has revealed that in the first five months of this year, 772 children crossed the Channel alone, compared with 242 children in the first five months of 2021.
These highly vulnerable children, who are likely to have fled war zones, have become separated from their parents and other family members. Those from countries such as Sudan, South Sudan and Eritrea are likely to have crossed deserts to reach Libya, where there is a high risk of being trafficked and imprisoned.
The true number of children crossing so far this year is likely to be higher than is reflected in the official data as some children are wrongly classified as adults by Home Office officials on arrival in the UK. The number of Channel crossings is at record levels compared with similar periods in previous years, with 11,095 people – adults and children – crossing so far this year including 316 in five boats on Thursday.
KCC confirmed that between 1 and 5 June they had taken 33 children who crossed in small boats into care – there were no crossings on either 1 or 2 June.
It has also emerged in a high court ruling on Wednesday – the fourth and final in a series about the welfare of child asylum seekers who cross the Channel in small boats – that an emergency process known as Trigger Point 4 has been activated several times this year on dates in March and April. This process, involving ministers from the Home Office and Department for Education, is triggered when KCC expects to reach full capacity to take in children within the next 72 hours.
The high court actions have brought an end to the Home Office practice of using hotels for about 5,000 children since June 2021. The Home Office closed its last hotel in January. During that period 440 children went missing from Home Office hotels and 132 have not been found. It is feared that some fell into the hands of traffickers.
The rulings found that both KCC and the Home Office acted unlawfully in various aspects of their dealings with this group of children.
The council has argued that it bears a disproportionate burden of responsibility for this group of newly arrived children owing to its geographical location. KCC has been given £47.63m in government funding to provide several new reception centres but these will not be available until later this year.
Under a system known as the national transfer scheme, this group of children were supposed to be dispersed fairly between different local authorities across the UK. But KCC has said that, despite the series of high court rulings, the scheme was still working too slowly and, as of March 2024, there were 4,952 available care places for these children across the UK out of a total of 13,870. KCC still has hundreds more children in its care than it should have based on the number it has been allocated.
Roger Gough, leader of KCC, said: “It remains Kent’s position that the scheme must be managed efficiently and effectively to transfer [unaccompanied asylum-seeking] children swiftly and safely to another UK local authority. This will ensure that these vulnerable children are looked after safely, that Kent’s children’s services are never unfairly overwhelmed again.”
Kama Petruczenko, of the Refugee Council, said: “The rise in the number of children arriving here who require protection and are separated from their families is deeply concerning. We regularly support traumatised children who arrive alone in Dover, having fled war, persecution and abuse.
“They have endured life-threatening journeys, and often arrive hungry, injured and in need of immediate help. A top priority for the next government must be to reduce these terrifying journeys by providing safe routes to the UK, including refugee visas, fairer family reunion rules, and increased resettlement places.”
A government spokesperson said: “We welcome this judgment and will continue to work with local authorities across the UK, including KCC, to support them to fulfil their statutory duties to accommodate unaccompanied children nationwide.”"

More than 70 million Americans - about one in five of the population - are living under heat alerts as temperatures soar.
Warnings have also been issued in four Canadian provinces with much of the continent now gripped by the heatwave.
Officials say US temperatures could top 100F (38C) on Wednesday or Thursday. Chicago is among the places that have set a new daily record.
Scientists say extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense as a result of climate change.
Meanwhile, firefighters have been battling a wildfire north of Los Angeles that has forced hundreds of people to leave their homes.
Elsewhere, Texas is expecting heavy rain as a storm bears down - and parts of Montana are experiencing rare June snow.
The extreme heat has been described by the National Weather Service (NWS) as the region's first significant heatwave of the season.
The heat has been brought on by a ""heat dome"" phenomenon, in which a high pressure system hovers over the same area for a long time and traps warm air underneath.
On Tuesday, the NWS said the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley and Northeast would be worst-affected for much of the week - with record-breaking temperatures possible.
The hottest locations in interior northern new England could see triple-figure Fahrenheit readings, forecasters added.
Chicago surpassed its temperature record for 17 June on Monday, according to the local NWS office. Temperatures climbed fractionally higher than the all-time high of 96F that was recorded in 1957.
Among the other big cities that have been sweltering are New York, Philadelphia and Washington.
In Canada, the provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario and Quebec are also under heat warnings, and officials are warning of ""dangerously hot and humid conditions"".
People in the affected areas of both countries have been advised to limit outdoor activity and stay hydrated. Extreme heat is the most deadly of all weather conditions, experts say.
In the western US, California's largest wildfire of the year so far has burned more than 15,000 acres (6,070 hectares) of land since igniting over the weekend.
The Post Fire, north of Los Angeles, is about 20% contained, according to the Cal Fire website. Hundreds of people have been forced to leave their homes.
While large swathes of the US are seeing record highs, it is a very different picture elsewhere.
Preparations have been made for what could be the first tropical storm of the season, Alberto, which could bring large amounts of rain to the Gulf Coast, southern Mexico and parts of Central America.
And an NWS winter storm warning remains in place for parts of Montana, where heavy snowfall has been forecast.
Earlier this month, daily records were broken during another heatwave in the Southwest - two weeks before the official start of summer.
Triple-digit readings were logged in Phoenix, among other areas.
Heatwaves have become more frequent and more intense globally since 1950, says the UN’s climate body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
That is because of human-caused climate change, which is fuelled by activities like burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests.
Hot extremes will happen even more often - and tend to reach higher temperatures – for as long as the world continues to warm, the IPCC says.
Europe is the fastest warming continent on Earth, with temperatures rising at twice the global average, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service.
In April, Copernicus highlighted how climate change was already taking its toll on the health of Europeans - pointing to increasing numbers of deaths linked to extreme heat over the last 20 years."

Ukraine has imposed emergency power shutdowns in most of the country a day after Russia unleashed large-scale attacks on energy infrastructure and claimed it made gains in the eastern Donetsk province
KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine imposed emergency power shutdowns in most of the country on Sunday, a day after Russia unleashed large-scale attacks on energy infrastructure and claimed it made gains in the eastern Donetsk province.
The shutdowns were in place in all but three regions of Ukraine following Saturday's drone and missile attack on energy targets that injured at least 19 people.
Ukraine’s state-owned power grid operator Ukrenergo said the shutdowns affected both industrial and household consumers.
Sustained Russian attacks on Ukraine’s power grid in recent weeks have forced the government to institute nationwide rolling blackouts. Without adequate air defenses to counter assaults and allow for repairs, though, the shortages could still worsen as need spikes in late summer and the bitter-cold winter.
Among the most significant recent strikes were an April barrage that damaged Kyiv’s largest thermal power plant and a massive attack on May 8 that targeted power generation and transmission facilities in several regions.
Following Saturday's barrage, Ukraine’s air force said Sunday that air defenses had shot down all 25 drones launched overnight.
Russia claimed Sunday that it had taken control of the village of Umanske in the partially Russian-occupied Donetsk region.
Russia’s coordinated new offensive has centered on Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region, but seems to include testing Ukrainian defenses in Donetsk farther south, while also launching incursions in the northern Sumy and Chernihiv regions.
In Russia, six people were injured in shelling in the city of Shebekino in the Belgorod region bordering Ukraine, regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said Sunday. He also said that a local official, the deputy head of the Korochansky district, had been killed by “detonation of ammunition."" He gave no details.
In the neighboring Kursk region, three people were injured Sunday when an explosive device was dropped from a drone, according to acting regional head Alexey Smirnov.
Speaking at Asia’s premier security conference in Singapore, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused China on Sunday of helping Russia to disrupt an upcoming Swiss-organized peace conference on the war in Ukraine.
Also on Sunday, White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby confirmed President Joe Biden agreed to allowing Ukraine to use some U.S.-provided weapons to strike inside Russia to relieve “incredible downward pressure” that Russia has put on Kharkiv.
Earlier this week, four U.S. officials, who requested anonymity, said President Joe Biden had given Ukraine the go-ahead to use American weaponry to strike inside Russia for the limited purpose of defending Kharkiv.
Ukraine asked for permission to use the U.S.-provided weapons to strike against “imminent threats just across the border,” Kirby said Sunday on ABC’s This Week With George Stephanopoulos.
“We’re talking about military emplacements, gun positions, that kind of thing. Logistics staging bases that the Russians were using to create some sort of buffer zone so that they could continue to pound Kharkiv.” Kirby said the permission is “limited to the Kharkiv region and it is limited with respect to the kinds of targets they can hit, and how far back they can go.”

KAVUMU, Congo (AP) — Health authorities have struggled to contain outbreaks of mpox in Congo, a huge central African country where a myriad of existing problems makes stemming the spread particularly hard.
Last month, the World Health Organization declared the outbreaks in Congo and about a dozen other African countries a global health emergency. And in Congo, scientists have identified a new strain of mpox that may spread more easily. It has reached areas where conflict and the displacement of a large number of people have already put health services under pressure.
Overall, Congo has more than 21,000 of the 25,093 confirmed and suspected mpox cases in Africa this year, according to WHO’s most recent count.
Has Congo seen cases of mpox before?
Yes, Congo is one of the African countries where mpox has been endemic for decades.
Mpox, once known as monkeypox, comes from the same family of viruses as smallpox but causes milder symptoms such as fever. People with more serious cases can develop skin lesions. More than 720 people in Africa have died in the latest outbreaks, mostly in Congo.
Mpox is a zoonotic disease, meaning it can spread to humans from infected animals. In the global mpox outbreak of 2022, the virus spread between people primarily through sex and close physical contact.
What changed in Congo?
In September 2023, mpox spread to Congo’s eastern province of South Kivu; it had previously been seen in the center and far west. Scientists then identified a new form of mpox in South Kivu that may be more infectious.
The WHO said that from the outbreak in South Kivu, the virus spread among people elsewhere in the country, arriving in neighboring province North Kivu. Those two provinces — some 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles) from the capital, Kinshasa — face escalating violence, a humanitarian crisis and other issues.
What are the problems in eastern Congo?
More than 120 armed groups have been fighting each other and the Congolese army for years in the eastern part of the country over the control of minerals. That has forced millions of people fleeing violence into refugee camps or nearby towns.
That means mpox is hitting already-stretched health facilities. Dr. Musole Mulambamunva Robert, medical director of the Kavumu hospital in eastern Congo, said it is “truly a challenge” — sometimes treating as many as four times the facility’s capacity for patients.
With more than 6 million displaced people in the east, authorities and aid agencies were already struggling to provide food and healthcare, while fighting other diseases such as cholera. Many people have no access to soap, clean water or other basics.
Some eastern Congo communities are out of reach of health clinics — roads are unreliable, and hourslong risky boat trips are sometimes the only means of transport, said Mercy Muthee Lake of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent.
People can be more susceptible to severe mpox cases because of malnutrition and undiagnosed HIV, she said.
She also said health workers in eastern Congo have requested more mpox training as medications to treat fever and ease pain run out.
Health authorities “are up against it because it’s such a complex area,” said Chris Beyrer, of Duke University’s Global Health Institute.
What about vaccines?
Africa has no capacity to produce mpox vaccines. Around 250,000 doses have arrived in Congo from the European Union and the United States, and more are expected. Congolese authorities say they need around 3 million vaccines. It will likely be weeks before any vaccines reach people in eastern Congo.
For now, the vaccine is approved only for adults. There’s limited evidence of how it works in children.
Vaccines are desperately needed, but they’re just “an additional tool,” said Emmanuel Lampaert, the Congo representative for Doctors Without Borders. The key, Lampaert said, is still identifying cases, isolating patients, and executing grassroots health and education campaigns.
Local conditions make that trying — Lampaert noted it’s almost impossible to isolate cases among poor, displaced people.
“Families with six to eight children are living in a hut, which is maybe the space of the bed we are sleeping in,” he said. “So, this is the reality.”
Why are critics blasting the mpox response?
Unlike the millions of dollars that poured into Congo for Ebola and COVID aid, the response to mpox has been sluggish, many critics say.
Health experts say the sharp contrast is due to a lack of both funds and international interest.
“Ebola is the most dangerous virus in the world, and COVID wiped out the world economy,” said professor Ali Bulabula, who works on infectious diseases in the medical department at Congo’s University of Kindu. “While mpox is a public health emergency of international concern, there is a lack of in-depth research and interest in the virus, as it’s still seen as a tropical disease, localized to Africa with no major impact on Western economies.”

3457,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-09-06,"Members of the ruling Slovak National Party (SNS) have bypassed Education Minister Tomáš Drucker (Hlas-SD/NI) to introduce an anti-LGBTI+ bill aimed at schools, despite the European Commission currently taking Hungary to court over similar legislation.
Four SNS MPs, led by party leader Andrej Danko, submitted the proposed amendment to the Education Act to parliament that seeks to establish a clear definition of what they call 'non-traditional sexual orientation', ban its 'promotion' and the dissemination of related ideas in schools. Schools found to be in breach of the law could be fined up to €30,000.
“Slovak society is founded on traditional values that define marriage as the exclusive union between a man and a woman, which is also explicitly stated in Article 41(1) of the Slovak Constitution,” the explanatory memorandum says.
“In the context of these values, the bill seeks to protect children and young people from influences that might conflict with constitutional principles,” it concludes.
But the pro-LGBT NGO Initiative Inakosť refutes this claim.
“Our constitutional court has already stated in the past that sexual orientation cannot be grounds for unequal treatment, and I believe it would do so again, even before European courts weigh in,” the Slovak NGO's director, Martin Macko, told Euractiv Slovakia.
SNS covering its own issuesThe bill, according to Macko, would not solve any of the problems facing the Slovak education system and would instead exacerbate existing problems, such as the bullying of LGBTI+ youth and the radicalisation of young people.
""We view the SNS's amendment to the Education Act as an attempt to boost their visibility on social media and distract from issues within their ministries,” added Macko, sharing the Education Ministry’s stance.
The SNS also proposed the law without consulting the Minister of Education, who described their decision as a “breach of the coalition agreement”.
“Minister Drucker appreciates the interest his colleagues from SNS show in education but believes they perceive enough problems within their own ministries,” the Education Ministry said.
Two of the three SNS-led ministries are at the centre of political controversy. The Culture Ministry sparked public protests and put 1,500 cultural workers on strike alert after dismissing several directors of cultural institutions and reportedly sacking 40% of the ministry's staff.
Meanwhile, the Environment Ministry stands out as the worst ministry in terms of meeting the milestones of Slovakia's recovery plan, Euractiv Slovakia has found.
Similar laws in Hungary and BulgariaIf enacted, the law proposed by SNS would closely resemble a section of Hungary's 2021 anti-LGBTI+ law.
However, the law, which prohibits minors from being exposed to content that promotes so-called “divergence from self-identity corresponding to sex at birth, sex change or homosexuality”, is expected to be reviewed by the EU Court following the European Commission’s challenge.
Similar legislation banning the ""promotion of LGBT+"" in schools was passed by the Bulgarian parliament in August this year after it was proposed by Bulgaria's pro-Russian Revival party.

TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Georgia’s parliament on Tuesday approved sweeping legislation that curtails LGBTQ+ rights, a measure that echoes laws adopted in neighboring Russia.
The bill, introduced by the ruling party Georgian Dream earlier this year, includes bans on same-sex marriages, adoptions by same-sex couples and public endorsement and depictions of LGBTQ+ relations and people in the media. It also bans gender-affirming care and changing gender designations in official documents.
The Orthodox Church wields great influence in Georgia, and demonstrations against the LGBTQ+ community are common. Last year, hundreds of opponents of gay rights stormed an LGBTQ+ festival in the Georgian capital, forcing the event’s cancellation. This year, tens of thousands marched in Tbilisi to promote “traditional family values.”
“Traditional family values” are also at the cornerstone of the Kremlin’s narrative in Russia, where authorities in the last decade banned public endorsement of “nontraditional sexual relations” as well as laws against gender-affirming care, among other measures. Its Supreme Court effectively outlawed LGBTQ+ activism by labeling what the authorities called the LGBTQ+ “movement” operating in Russia as an extremist organization and banning it.
The new initiative was announced by Georgian Dream after the country in June adopted the “foreign influence” law that critics also denounced as borrowed from Moscow’s playbook. The measure requires media and nongovernmental organizations to register as “pursuing the interests of a foreign power” if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad.
That measure ignited weeks of protests and was widely criticized as threatening democratic freedoms and jeopardizing Georgia’s chances of joining the European Union. The South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million formally applied to join in 2022, after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but the bloc halted its accession in response to the “foreign influence” law and froze some of its financial support. The United States imposed sanctions on dozens of Georgian officials in response to the law.
The anti-LGBTQ+ bill was approved on its third and final reading, with 84 of 150 lawmakers voting for it. It now must be signed by President Salome Zourabichvili. Zourabichvili, who has been at odds with the ruling party. She can veto the bill, the same way she vetoed the foreign influence law, but the parliament, dominated by Georgian Dream, can override her and adopt the legislation regardless.
Georgia’s constitution states that “marriage is based on the legal equality and free will of the spouses” but does not explicitly ban same-sex marriage, and the country’s civil code clarifies that marriage is a “voluntary union between a man and a woman.” The new legislation by the ruling party, which does not have the votes to change the constitution, contains a more explicit ban and is seen as a populist step to win the support of marginal groups.
Georgia will hold a parliamentary election on Oct. 26, with the ruling party seeking to retain its dominance.
Georgian Dream was set up up by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia and served briefly as Georgia’s prime minister in 2012. It promised to restore civil rights and “reset” relations with Moscow, which fought a brief war with Georgia in 2008 over the breakaway province of South Ossetia. Russia then recognized the independence of South Ossetia and another breakaway Georgian province, Abkhazia, and established military bases there.
Many Georgians backed Ukraine as Kyiv battled Russia’s invasion in 2022. But the Georgian government abstained from joining sanctions against Moscow, barred dozens of Kremlin critics from entering the country, and accused the West of trying to drag Tbilisi into open conflict with Russia. The opposition has accused the ruling party of steering the country into Russia’s orbit at the detriment of its European aspirations.

The first case of polio in Gaza in 25 years was detected in July.
The last day of the polio vaccination campaign is wrapping up in Gaza, the World Health Organization (WHO) said Thursday.
The campaign was launched after the first case of polio in Gaza in more than 25 years was recently detected. Health officials from the WHO, the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health and partner organizations said they would be vaccinating children in three-day phases starting in central Gaza, then in southern Gaza, and ending in the north.
As of Thursday morning, more than 552,000 children under age 10 out of 640,000 have been vaccinated in Gaza, according to the WHO. The organization said at least 90% coverage is needed to stop a potential outbreak in Gaza, and the campaign may be extended if that 90% figure isn't achieved on Thursday.
Poliovirus was first detected in sewage samples from the cities of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis – in central and southern Gaza, respectively – in mid-July, in tests conducted by the Gaza Ministry of Health in coordination with the UN.
In mid-August, the Ministry of Health reported the first case of polio in Gaza in 25 years, in a 10-month-old child who had not been vaccinated. Doctors suspected polio after symptoms resembled the virus, which was confirmed in test conducted in Amman, the capital of Jordan, according to the WHO.
Children are receiving two drops of novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2), which has been used for outbreak response under the WHO's Emergency Use Listing approval since March 2021. A second dose is typically given four weeks after the first.
""We want to protect our children from diseases and give them the necessary vaccines because prevention is better than cure,"" Islam Saleh, a mother in northern Gaza, said in a video issued by the United Nations (UN) on Wednesday.
""I fear for my son because there is no cure for polio. This dose he received will protect him, and it is safe,"" Saleh added.
Officials have said that the vaccination operation is complicated by access restrictions, evacuation orders and fuel shortages. Israel has agreed to ""temporary"" pauses in fighting each day in order for the vaccinations to be administered.
Earlier this week, a convoy of UN vehicles in northern Gaza was stopped and questioned by Israeli Security Forces before being released, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement.
Polio largely affects children under age 5 and can lead to paralysis or death. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, there are about 341,000 children under the age of five in Gaza.
Children in the U.S. are recommended to get the inactivated polio vaccine as part of routine childhood immunization, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It consists of four doses in total administered first at 2 months of age, then at 4 months, 6-18 months, and 4-6 years.
""It has been heartening to see the response to the campaign,"" the WHO said in comments released after a press briefing on Thursday. ""Everywhere the team has gone, parents are doing all they can to ensure their child does not miss vaccination. Many vaccination sites received more than expected crowds. Special coordinated missions were also conducted to reach children in insecure and heard to reach areas.""

But Italy, the EU’s third-biggest economy, will start voting later Saturday, with its results likely to have a big impact on how the parliament is configured and on the future course of the bloc.
In Slovakia, the May 15 assassination attempt on Fico by a 71-year-old poet rocked the nation of 5.4 million and spread shockwaves across the EU.
A visibly thinner Fico had issued a pre-poll video describing his attacker as “an activist of the Slovak opposition” which he accused of “aggressive and hateful politics”.
“It was only a matter of time before a tragedy would occur,” the four-time PM said in the 14-minute video.
His party, which highlighted the attack in its campaign events, opposes EU arms deliveries to Ukraine and rails against alleged “warmongers” in Brussels.
Violence has occurred elsewhere in the bloc.
Late Friday, a man hit Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen in a Copenhagen square.
She was not seriously hurt, according to witnesses. Police arrested the assailant, whose motive was not immediately known. Denmark also votes on Sunday.
EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen condemned the “despicable act” against Frederiksen.
But it was the shooting of Fico that was the most dramatic incident in the bloc ahead of the polls.
In its wake, support for Fico’s left-wing populist Smer-SD party has skyrocketed and soared past its main liberal rival to the top of voter-intention surveys.
Historically however, Slovakia registers low turnout in EU elections. In the last one, in 2019, just 22 percent of voters cast ballots.
Meloni, queenmaker?
Later Saturday attention will shift to Italy’s vote. Far-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is hoping a strong showing from her party will strengthen her hand as a key EU powerbroker.
Meloni has already been courted by centre-right von der Leyen – and by French far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who wants to create an EU supergroup of far-right parties.
Meloni has not said what she will do, but has insisted her goal is to relegate EU left-wing parties to the opposition benches.
Domestically, a commanding performance could help further tighten Meloni’s dominance over Italy’s notoriously turbulent political scene.
The prime minister has been omnipresent in national media in the run up to the elections, notably portraying herself as a bulwark against illegal immigration.
Increasing backlash against migrants has driven far-right fortunes across the EU, and was one of the key reasons Meloni was propelled to power in 2022.

A study published in the Nature Portfolio Journal warns that Australia’s soil is becoming a net carbon emitter and threatens to ruin the country’s net zero goals.
“They claim that over the next 80 years, Australian soil … will release up to 100 megatons of CO2 into the atmosphere,” Sky News host James Macpherson said.
“There you have it … dirt is now a major threat to the future of planet Earth.
“I reckon some greenie councillor is going to make you concrete everything now that they know dirt is a climate criminal.”
Macpherson was referring to an article published by The Guardian yesterday about a study published on 26 March 2024 titled ‘A warming climate will make Australian soil a net emitter of atmospheric CO2’.
The study’s lead author, Professor Raphael Viscarra Rossel, said the “concerning” findings showed the substantial threat soil carbon losses posed to Australia’s emissions reduction targets.
“If Australia wants to achieve its emissions reductions targets … that’s a significant amount of emissions that we’re not accounting for,” he said.
“The climate change problem is so large and so wicked that soil is not going to solve the problem,” he said. “But it can play a part by mitigating the [soil carbon] losses we are projecting.”
As if the whole affair wasn’t peculiar enough, the study said there was well-documented “uncertainty” in modelling future soil carbon levels and that “our understanding of the sources of this uncertainty is evolving.”
The researchers’ work was funded by the Australian Government through the Australian Research Council’s Discovery Projects scheme and the Australia-China Science and Research Fund’s (“ACSRF’s”) Joint Research Centres (“JRCs”).
In other words, tax collected from hard-working and productive Australians is being used to fund Prof. Viscarra Rossel and his colleagues to guess what effect a so called “warming climate” will have on CO2 being released from Australian soil. Do you feel like you’re being had?

5932,fake,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-11-12,"According to a piece from the magazine published on Nov. 6, NATO has realized that Kyiv's position is slowly worsening and that it has almost no chance of coming out on top in its conflict with Russia. ""NATO sources and Western security officials almost universally agree that Ukraine is slowly losing the war,"" FP reported.
The magazine noted that an especially difficult winter will make things more difficult for Kyiv. Moreover, Moscow's attacks on Ukrainian ports have also hurt Ukraine's logistics. Nevertheless, Western officials have warned that a Russian victory would solidify the Kremlin's influence in Europe.
Michael Bociurkiw, a lobbyist at the think tank the Atlantic Council, said the Kremlin has noticed a leadership ""vacuum"" in Kyiv and is ""testing for soft tissue"" in the West. He noted that Moscow's strategy has been effective as missile strikes across Ukrainian cities have increased the possibility of power and heating shortages as winter approaches.
""The Russian strategy in the east seems to be to freeze people out and heavily bomb their cities and towns. The strategy in the south seems to be to manipulate a key international artery for food,"" Bociurkiw remarked.
The lobbyist also expressed his belief that Russia has been taking advantage of the vacuum created by the recently concluded United States presidential election, alongside uncertainty about whether Washington's support for Ukraine will survive a change of administration.
""It's been really disheartening to see the lack of spine in Washington and elsewhere,"" he commented.
According to Signs of the Times (SOTT), Moscow has highlighted Kyiv's aspirations to join NATO as among the main reasons it launched its ""special military operation"" against Ukraine in February 2022. (Related: Blinken says Ukraine ""will become a member of NATO."")
""Russia has intensified its strikes on Ukrainian military and energy facilities in recent months,"" SOTT continued. ""In April, the [Russian Ministry of Defense] sad they were a response to Kyiv's attempts to target Russian oil infrastructure. [The ministry stressed] that the targeted facilities support the Ukrainian defense industry, and that the strikes do not target civilians.""
Given the escalating violence, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has emphasized the importance of both Moscow and Kyiv laying down their arms. But according to FP, this shift could mean a reassessment of Washington's aid to Ukraine. Observers who talked to the magazine have warned that this may signal a weakened American footprint on the global stage – aligning with Trump's America First policy.
King's College London professor Ruth Deyermond warned against a ceasefire, however, claiming that doing so would cause the Americans to lose face. Such a move, she added, would only permit Russia to bolster its military capability in the interim.
""Ukraine losing would look to the rest of the world as if the U.S. was losing to Russia. Any scaling back of U.S. support would also look as if the U.S. had been forced to retreat by Russia,"" explained Deyermond.
""If there's a ceasefire that effectively allows Russia to hold that territory, it will allow Russia to consolidate its position, reinforcing its military presence. With no war to fight, it would also be able to develop its military presence in Belarus – threatening NATO members in the Baltic region,"" Deyermond continued. ""And an emboldened Russia would be likely to escalate its attacks on European critical infrastructure and increase its interference in many NATO states, including the United States.""
SOTT ultimately remarked: ""Ukraine was never anything more than a patsy battering ram to try to weaken Russia, an Eastern European Vietnam as it were. Except that it didn't work. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.""

2695,fake,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-02-05,"Laura Paddison, the senior climate writer for the CNN Wire news service, wrote about the “dangerous” threat of social media “wellness influencers” having unapproved opinions about the weather: “Wellness influencers fueled pandemic misinformation. Now they have another big conspiracy in their sights.”
The CNN writer rhetorically set her hair on fire over what one ""influencer"" with a relatively minor following was saying about the wildfire in Hawaii:
When wildfire ripped through Hawaii’s Maui last August, the impact was devastating: a whole town reduced to ashes, more than 100 lives lost. The inferno was described as the “largest natural disaster in state history.”
But some on Instagram suggested, without evidence, there was something much more nefarious at play.
Wellness influencer @truth_crunchy_mama told her 37,000 followers to “stop blaming things on nature that were actually caused by the government.” They’re “going to keep setting wildfires until we all submit to their climate change agenda,” she said in another post.
The story, which was circulated on Microsoft News (msn.com), took a hysterical view of social media posts while accepting as absolute truth the idea of an urgent climate emergency. One subhead actually read ""Dangerous rhetoric.""
Does Instagram change the weather?
….for years there has been a merging of wellness, disinformation and conspiracy, as a subset of influencers use the backdrop of aesthetically pleasing, pastel-colored posts to spread much darker messages, weaving together alarming conspiracy theories with calls for users to buy their supplements or services.
This phenomenon exploded during the pandemic, when anti-vax sentiment took hold in large parts of the wellness community. As interest in the pandemic waned, experts say some wellness influencers have latched on to climate change to galvanize followers.
Their concern: Those influencers -- some with hundreds of thousands of followers -- are exposing new, and younger, audiences to a slew of misinformation and undermining efforts to tackle the climate crisis.
….
Some focused on deadly extreme weather events, saying they were orchestrated by the government, or that malign global forces were modifying the weather. Others claimed climate policies were a plot to control people’s lives, bodies and diets…
Paddison’s story contained some truly ominous sentences denigrating personal freedom and mocking mistrust of authority, odd stances from a journalist:
A strong thread of individualism runs through wellness accounts, alongside a deep distrust of authorities. “They emphasize individual solutions to collective problems, and they sell wellness as a response to climate anxiety,” she said.
Public health authorities suffered a well-earned loss of legitimacy after their authoritarian, capricious, panicky reaction to the coronavirus, shutting down schools and businesses and mandating vaccinations and useless cloth masks. And Paddison was upset the influencers were capitalizing on it:
Many of these influencers maintain they are merely speaking truth to power. It’s a theme of @truth_crunchy_mama account, who calls herself a “truth teller.” The person who runs the account did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.
Another bizarre sentence:
….Wellness has now come to mean almost anything, said [Stephanie Alice] Baker, but at its core it revolves around ideas of individualism, self-enlightenment and distrust of institutions -- a near-perfect breeding ground for conspiracy theories to flourish.
Paddison took the most extreme views on climate as undeniable truths that must be protected by censorship if necessary:
….Climate misinformation is having “a profound impact” both on people’s beliefs and on the normalization of fringe perspectives, Caulfield said. Not only does it undermine climate solutions, it also depoliticizes people, sowing distrust in climate policies.
Paddison nodded along to her sources’ calls for extreme censoriousness in support of the fanatical narrative. ""It’s particularly worrying as it allows climate misinformation to reach new audiences, experts say, including young people that might otherwise be supportive of climate change action,"" she wrote.
And who should decide what “contradicts climate science”? Environmental extremists, of course:
For others, the focus is much more on the other platforms hosting these influencers. Hood is pushing for more clarity on climate policies, and for measures including bans on amplifying and monetizing content that clearly contradicts climate science."
2508,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-04-12,"Curbs on the amount of greenhouse gases being pumped into the atmosphere are just one of the ways that politicians are reacting to the scientific evidence that we are damaging our health and our planet. An even greater threat to human life in the short term has been air pollution in the form of particulate matter from the burning of fossil fuels, agriculture and many industrial processes.
Clean air has become a crusade everywhere from Beijing to London, to save lives and improve economic output. At the same time as damaging lungs and hearts, the aerosols produced by pollution increase cloud formation, change rainfall patterns and reflect sunlight back into space, thus cooling the planet.
Scientists studying the significant progress that has been made in cutting air pollution this century concluded that this success had also “added considerably to amount of global warming we can expect”. The removal of pollution is already partly responsible for the “unprecedented rate of human-induced warming in the last decade”, they said.
The problem is that carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, the main greenhouse gases, remain in the atmosphere for long periods, continuing to add to global heating, while the disappearance of aerosols instantly removes any protection. So, they say, less air pollution means we may expect continued acceleration of surface temperatures this decade."
2834,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-07-16,"New tech aims to keep polar bears and people apart
At the end of the Canadian Arctic summer, polar bears head inland to wait for the ice to form.
And while thousands of tourists flock to catch a glimpse of these magnificent predators, researchers are developing novel ways to keep people and bears safely separated.
New tracking devices that stick in polar bears’ fur could be the key to protecting both people and bears - by closely monitoring the animals' locations.
Polar bears now spend more of the year on land, as Arctic sea ice melts, so conservationists are increasingly concerned about bears and people coming into contact.
The tracking tags, which have been tested on bears in Canadian Arctic, could help prevent those encounters, by “keeping a remote eye” on the bears.
Lead researcher Tyler Ross, a PhD candidate from York University in Toronto, said the fur tags were “particularly promising” for the prevention of these “human-bear interactions”.
In communities in the southern Canadian Arctic, where the scientists tested these tags, polar bears that wander too close to a community are sometimes caught, transported and released in carefully selected sites away from towns and villages.
“These tags could be fitted to those bears to monitor where they are after they've been released,” explained Mr Ross.
“If they're coming back towards the community, conservation staff would have a sense of where they are, and they could head them off. I think that's where they offer considerable promise.""
The researcher, who studies polar bear ecology, also says the tags could fill important gaps in knowledge about the bears. And as the Arctic climate warms up rapidly, the need to monitor bears becomes increasingly urgent.
“There's a dearth of information about male polar bear movements, because they can't be equipped with conventional tracking collars,” said Mr Ross.
The sea ice [that the polar bears use as a platform from which to hunt] is disappearing faster than it has in the past,” explained Mr Ross. “So the winter hunting season is getting shorter. We want to know where they're moving in response.”
Polar bears are difficult to tag. Male bears’ heads are smaller than their necks, so tracking collars can just slip off.
Another option is ear tags - attached by piercing the bear’s ear. They require an animal to be recaptured in order to remove the tag and, in rare cases, can injure the ear.
The three new tags the researchers tested were designed by the company 3M in collaboration with the charity Polar Bears International. They all attach to the bears’ coarse fur.
To fit the tags, scientists had to locate and sedate bears. They then assessed the quality of the data they received from each device and noted when the tags fell off.
The best performing device was called a SeaTrkr tag, which is “crimped” into the bears’ fur. It stayed attached for an average of 58 days and - with an in-built GPS system - allowed the scientists to pinpoint the bears’ location to within just a few metres.
“It’s ideal to have something that falls off naturally - that’s not permanently attached to the bear,” explained Mr Ross. “But anything that lasts in the order of a few months would be great [for our research], because then you’re getting these important seasons that the bears are going through throughout the year.”
Climate change is bringing bears and humans into closer proximity, making places where polar bears and people coexist, riskier for both.
One US Geological Survey study in 2022 that that used data from satellite tracking collars on more than 400 polar bears in Alaska, shows the time they spend onshore has grown significantly in recent decades.
“Getting a better sense of polar bears’ movements is really crucial,” Mr Ross commented. “Particularly given the state of their environment at this point.”
This study of the bear tags is published in the journal Animal Biotelemetry."

Passage of harsh anti-LGBTQ+ law in Iraq draws diplomatic backlash
Iraq has passed a harsh anti-LGBTQ+ law which would impose heavy prison sentences on gay and transgender people. Passed quietly by the country’s parliament on Saturday, the law was part of an amendment to an existing anti-prostitution law. It has been strongly criticised by human rights groups and diplomats alike.

(AP Photo/Anmar Khalil, File)
BAGHDAD (AP) — Human rights groups and diplomats criticized a law that was quietly passed by the Iraqi parliament over the weekend that would impose heavy prison sentences on gay and transgender people.
U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement that the law passed Saturday “threatens those most at risk in Iraqi society” and “can be used to hamper free-speech and expression.” He warned that the legislation could drive away foreign investment.
“International business coalitions have already indicated that such discrimination in Iraq will harm business and economic growth in the country,” the statement said.
British Foreign Secretary David Cameron called the law “dangerous and worrying.”
Although homosexuality is taboo in the largely conservative Iraqi society, and political leaders have periodically launched anti-LGBTQ+ campaigns, Iraq did not previously have a law that explicitly criminalized it.
The law passed Saturday with little notice as an amendment to the country’s existing anti-prostitution law. It imposes a sentence of 10 to 15 years for same-sex relations and a prison term of one to three years for people who undergo or perform gender-transition surgeries and for “intentional practice of effeminacy.”
It also bans any organization that promotes “sexual deviancy,” imposing a sentence of at least seven years and a fine of no less than 10 million dinars (about $7,600).
A previous draft version of the anti-prostitution law, which was ultimately not passed, would have allowed the death sentence to be imposed for same-sex relations.
Iraqi officials have defended the law as upholding societal values and portrayed criticisms of it as Western interference.
The acting Iraqi parliamentary speaker, Mohsen Al-Mandalawi, said in a statement that the vote was “a necessary step to protect the value structure of society” and to “protect our children from calls for moral depravity and homosexuality.”
Rasha Younes, a senior researcher with the LGBT Rights Program at Human Rights Watch, said the law’s passage “rubber-stamps Iraq’s appalling record of rights violations against LGBT people and is a serious blow to fundamental human rights, including the rights to freedom of expression and association, privacy, equality, and nondiscrimination.”
A report released by the organization in 2022 accused armed groups in Iraq of abducting, raping, torturing, and killing lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people with impunity and the Iraqi government of failing to hold perpetrators accountable.
A group of Iraqi lawmakers said Sunday that they had launched a campaign to expel U.S. Ambassador Alina Romanowski, accusing her of interfering in the country’s internal affairs after she issued a statement condemning the legislation.
Iraqis interviewed Sunday expressed mixed views.
Baghdad resident Ahmed Mansour said he supports the legislation “because it follows the texts of the Quran and the Islamic religion by completely prohibiting this subject due to religious taboos.”
Hudhayfah Ali, another resident of Baghdad, said he is against it “because Iraq is a country of multiple sects and religions.”
“Iraq is a democratic country, so how can a law be passed against democracy and personal freedom?” he said.

Dr. Vernon Coleman highlights a study published in June 2024 that proves covid “vaccines” cause psychiatric disorders. A study that very few doctors see to have noticed.
The study set out to investigate psychiatric adverse events from covid vaccinations. The authors recruited 50% of the Seoul-resident population randomly selected from the Korean National Health Insurance Service (KNHIS) claims database on 1 January 2021, resulting in a total of 2,027,353 participants. The participants were divided into two groups according to covid-19 vaccination status: vaccinated and non-vaccinated.
The study found that covid vaccination increased the risks of depression, anxiety, dissociative, stress-related, and somatoform disorders, and sleep disorders.

I’ve reported this before, but very few doctors seem to have noticed so I’ll try again.
There is now clear, indisputable evidence showing that the covid-19 vaccine causes mental (as well as physical) illness.
In a scientific paper entitled `Psychiatric adverse events following covid-19 vaccination: a population based cohort study in Seoul, South Korea’ the authors concluded that covid-19 vaccination “increased the risks of depression, anxiety, dissociation, stress-related and somatoform disorders and sleep disorders.”
The authors warned that “special cautions are necessary for administering additional covid-19 vaccinations to populations vulnerable to psychiatric adverse events.”
The study involved a randomly selected 50% of the population residing in Seoul, a total of 4,348,412 people (excluding those under 20 years of age), [2,027,353] were involved in the study which compared those who had been vaccinated with those who had not.
If you find me any scientific study performed by a vaccine manufacturer which involved over four million people I will eat my second best hat.
I repeat: any doctor or nurse still giving the covid-19 vaccine should be arrested and they should lose their licences to practice. The covid-19 vaccine does not do what it is intended to do but does cause a wide range of physical and mental disorders (most of which I warned about on this website in 2020).
Please put this article on X, Facebook etc., etc., (I’m banned from ALL social media) and send copies to your doctor and your local media.
Note: There is a list of my books about the covid fraud in the bookshop on http://www.vernoncoleman.com. The books are under the heading ‘Covid books and the Great Reset’. My first book about the covid fraud was published in April 2020 and called Coming Apocalypse. I believe it is still the best introduction to what happened in 2020 – and how our lives were changed forever.

Paris-based political analyst Dominique Moïsi says French President Emmanuel Macron’s call for a snap national elections after his party was shaken by the results of the European elections is a risky bet. (AP video: Oleg Cetinic and Nicolas Garriga)
BRUSSELS (AP) — Far-right parties rattled the traditional powers in the European Union with major gains in parliamentary seats, dealing an especially humiliating defeat to French President Emmanuel Macron, who called snap legislative elections.
Some ballots in the vote for the European Parliament were still being counted Monday, but the outcome showed the 27-nation bloc’s parliament membership has clearly shifted to the right. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni more than doubled her party’s seats in the assembly. And despite being hounded by a scandal involving candidates, the Alternative for Germany extreme right party still rallied enough seats to sweep past the slumping Social Democrats of Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
Sensing a threat from the far right, the Christian Democrats of EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had already shifted further to the right on migration and climate ahead of the elections — and were rewarded by remaining by far the biggest group in the 720-seat European Parliament and de facto brokers of the ever-expanding powers of the legislature.
But the surge by nationalist and populist parties across Europe will make it much harder for the assembly to approve legislation on issues ranging from climate change to agriculture policy for the next five years.
Undoubtedly however, the star on a stunning electoral night was the National Rally party of Marine Le Pen, which dominated the French polls to such an extent that Macron immediately dissolved the national parliament and called for new elections to start later this month. It was a massive political risk since his party could suffer more losses, hobbling the rest of his presidential term that ends in 2027.
Le Pen was delighted to accept the challenge. “We’re ready to turn the country around, ready to defend the interests of the French, ready to put an end to mass immigration,” she said, echoing the rallying cry of so many far-right leaders in other countries who were celebrating substantial wins.
Her National Rally won over 30% or about twice as much as Macron’s pro-European centrist Renew party that is projected to reach less than 15%.
Macron acknowledged the thud of defeat. “I’ve heard your message, your concerns, and I won’t leave them unanswered,” he said, adding that calling a snap election only underscored his democratic credentials.
In Germany, the EU’s most populous nation, projections indicated that voters had not been dissuaded by the AfD’s scandals as it rose to 16.5%, up from 11% in 2019. In comparison, the combined result for the three parties in the German governing coalition barely topped 30%.
Scholz’s governing Social Democratic party was humiliated as the Alternative for Germany surged into second place. “After all the prophecies of doom, after the barrage of the last few weeks, we are the second strongest force,” a jubilant AfD leader Alice Weidel said.
Overall across the EU, two mainstream and pro-European groups, the Christian Democrats and the Socialists, remained dominant in the voting that concluded Sunday. The gains of the far right came at the expense of the Greens, who were expected to lose about 20 seats and fall back to sixth position in the legislature. Macron’s pro-business Renew group also lost big.
After having flirted during campaigning with the idea of working with a political group further right, von der Leyen offered late Sunday to build a coalition with the Social Democrats, which mostly held its ground in the elections, and the pro-business Liberals.
“We are by far the strongest party, We are the anchor of stability,” von der Leyen said. Reflecting on the rise of the far-right and good showing of the far-left, she added that the result brings “great stability for the parties in the center. We all have interest in stability and we all want a strong and effective Europe.”
In the legislature, provisional results showed that the Christian Democrats would have 189 seats, up 13, the Social Democrats 135, down 4 and the pro-business Renew group 83, down 19. The Greens slumped to 53, down 18.
Germany, traditionally a stronghold for environmentalists, exemplified the humbling of the Greens, who were predicted to fall from 20% to 12%. With further losses expected in France and elsewhere, the Greens’ defeat could well have an impact on the EU’s climate change policies, still the most progressive across the globe.
Senior party members in the EU’s parliament were due to hold talks on Monday to see what alliances might be established. Key to the future working of the assembly will be whether the far right unites in a strong enough bloc to challenge the main pro-European groups.
The elections come at a testing time for voter confidence in a bloc of some 450 million people. Over the last five years, the EU has been shaken by the coronavirus pandemic, an economic slump and an energy crisis fueled by Russia’s war in Ukraine. But campaigning often focused on issues in individual countries rather than on broader European interests.
Since the last EU election in 2019, populist or far-right parties now lead governments in three nations — Hungary, Slovakia and Italy — and are part of ruling coalitions in others including Sweden, Finland and, soon, the Netherlands.

6105,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-09-16,"Study suggests green financing will boost the economy but Mediterranean countries will endure fiscal challenges.
Italy and Spain could face greater levels of austerity as a consequence of public investments to cut Europe’s greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040, a new study published today (September 16) suggests.
Think tank Agora Energiewende said the energy transition could entail 2% growth of Europe’s economy by 2040, linked to green investments. But after analysing the specific circumstances of France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain, it flagged specific challenges faced by the Mediterranean countries due to their high debt levels.
Despite the overall positive economic effect projected in the analysis, the heavily indebted countries are likely to see debt levels rise further unless governments implement additional austerity measures.
“EU member states should start to assess and address transition-related fiscal risks in debt sustainability analyses and national budget plans,” Agora suggested, noting EU governments cannot rely on carbon pricing revenues alone to finance their climate investment programmes.
Matthias Buck, Agora’s director, said that revenues from the sale of CO2 emissions allowances would start to decline in the mid-2030s as the fossil fuel tax base dwindles, underscoring the importance of EU climate funding in the next EU budget.
“EU co-ﬁnancing of national climate investments, for example in buildings and clean transport, reduces the need for governments to choose between ﬁscal and environmental sustainability,” said Buck.
Investment of at least 462 billion euros, corresponding to 2.7% of EU economic output, will be needed every year throughout this decade, Agora estimates, echoing similarly large sums cited in the recent Draghi report on competitiveness and energy transition.
These investment needs will further increase to 3.3% or 564 billion euros in the 2030s before they taper again with the share of public investments corresponding to around 1.1% of EU GDP annually, according to the study.
Investing in areas such as clean tech, net-zero infrastructure and building renovations would strengthen EU manufacturing, create new jobs and foster economic convergence between Western and Eastern Europe, Agora noted, urging the bloc to ensure continued EU-level funding after 2026 when an EU programme to safeguard poorer citizens during the transition is set to end.
But the call for increased funding comes in the wake of probe by the European Court of Auditors (ECA), which last week denounced the misuse of green funds, saying that several EU countries had overestimated the cost of climate projects and miscounted actual sums spent.
Luke Haywood, policy manager for climate and energy at the EEB said if the European Commission does not assume its responsibility to ensure that resources disbursed are used for their stated purpose, they will continue to fund projects that are not in line with the aims of climate and nature policy.
“Monitoring is of critical importance, as many of the issues cited in this [ECA] report have arisen at least in part due to a lack of oversight at EU-level, and a lack of capacity to do so at the regional and local levels,” Haywood told Euronews, suggesting that resources to cover administrative capacity at the local levels, to ensure appropriate project oversight, should be included from project inception stage."

They also made their way into food from a number of sources, including, according to some social media users, plastic cutting boards that are in use in many home kitchens.

Every slice shows microplastics moving from the board into food
Plastic cutting boards are evil pic.twitter.com/juOVHU7w72
— Case Bradford (@casbrad) February 17, 2024
The underlying claim that plastic cutting boards have been shown to shed microplastics into food is true, based on findings published from a small-scale study in the American Chemical Society's scientific journal, Environmental Science & Technology, on May 23, 2023.
Typically, cutting boards are made of rubber, bamboo, wood or plastic. When food is minced, chopped or sliced with knives while on these boards, small pieces of material have been shown to slough off. Small parts of plastic, in particular, are released into some food products prepared on cutting boards.
The ACS study was designed to determine how board material and chopping styles, both with and without vegetables present, influenced how much microplastic was released. First, five people chopped on three different polyethylene cutting boards without vegetables to measure the amount of microplastics released. Next, these same people chopped on polyethylene, polypropylene and wooden boards to compare microplastic release across all three. Finally, carrots were chopped on the polyethylene board to see how the release compared when using a vegetable instead of when not.
The researchers found that plastic chopping boards were a ""substantial source of microplastics in human food"" influenced both by a person's chopping style and the cutting board's material.
While propylene was shown to shed more than polyethylene did, the study authors calculated between 14 million and 17 million polyethylene microplastics and 79 million polypropylene microplastics from their respective boards each year. However, those figures may fluctuate based on how a person chops, the force needed to cut through certain foods, and the wear and tear of a particular board, among other factors.
""Our understanding is that human instincts will drive the required force based on the hardness of the food being chopped. For instance, a restaurant that chops steaks (e.g., chicken and beef) on plastic chopping boards before serving may see different microplastic counts in the final steaks,"" wrote the study authors.
It adds to a growing body of research aimed at understanding how microplastics enter the food chain. One study, for example, found that a single human takes in between 39,000 and 52,000 microplastics each year through food. Another found that people consume an estimated 1,530 microplastics through food and another 587 by drinking water.
And it's not just cutting boards that microplastics originate from. In 2021, researchers at Dalian University of Technology in China determined that plastic packaging can contaminate fruits and vegetables. Microwaving and heating plastic products have also been shown to release microplastics into food.
The ACS study found the plastics sloughed off weren't toxic to mice cells tested in a lab over 72 hours, but the long-term effects of ingesting microplastics aren't well documented. A World Health Organization analysis of microplastic research available as of this publication found that ""there is currently limited evidence to suggest microplastics are causing significant adverse health impacts.""
""There are major knowledge gaps in scientific understanding of the impact of microplastics and the weight of the current evidence is low to conclude the casualty of adverse effects. Further and more holistic research is needed to obtain a more accurate assessment of exposure to microplastics and their potential impacts on human health,"" wrote WHO in a June 2023 news release.

JACUMBA HOT SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) — On many nights, hundreds of migrants squeeze through poles in a border wall or climb over on metal ladders. They gather in a buffer zone between two walls with views of the night lights of Tijuana, Mexico, waiting hours for Border Patrol agents while volunteers deliver hot coffee, instant ramen and bandages for busted knees and swollen ankles.
About an hour drive east, where the moon offers the only light, up to hundreds more navigate a boulder-strewn desert looking for always-shifting areas where migrants congregate. Groups of just a few to dozens walk dirt trails and paved roads searching for agents.
The scenes are a daily reminder that San Diego became the busiest corridor for illegal crossings in April, according to U.S. figures, the fifth region to hold that distinction in two years in a sign of how quickly migration routes are changing.
Routes were remarkably stable a short time ago. San Diego was the busiest Border Patrol sector for decades until more enforcement pushed migrants to the desert area near Tucson, Arizona, which became the top spot by 1998. The Rio Grande Valley in South Texas saw the most activity from 2013 to June 2022 as Central Americans became a greater presence.
Migrants were arrested nearly 128,900 times on the Mexican border in April, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Wednesday, down 6.3% from March and barely half of a record-high 250,000 in December. While still historically high, April bucked a typical spring increase.
The drop is largely due to heightened Mexican enforcement, which includes blocking migrants from boarding freight trains, according to U.S. officials. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott touts his multibillion-dollar border crackdown, while others highlight violence in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas as a deterrent on the path to the Rio Grande Valley.
Mexico pledged it won’t allow more than 4,000 illegal crossings a day to the U.S., Alicia Bárcena, Mexico’s foreign relations secretary, told reporters Tuesday. The U.S. Border Patrol arrested more than 10,000 on some days in December.
Despite the overall decline, arrests in the San Diego sector reached 37,370 in April, up 10.6% from March to replace Tucson as the busiest of nine sectors bordering Mexico. Troy Miller, CBP’s acting commissioner, said more enforcement, including with other countries, led to overall declines from March, while acknowledging “continually shifting migration patterns.”
Many migrants say San Diego is the easiest and least dangerous place to cross. They constantly check their phones for messages, social media posts and voice calls that help them plan their route and crossing.
“One hears many things on the way,” Oscar Palacios, 42, said one April morning after being driven by an agent to wait in a dirt patch where more than 100 migrants shivered near campfires. After Mexican immigration agents returned him three times to southern Mexico, the Ecuadorian man said, he gave someone he didn’t know $500 for a document that allowed him to fly to Tijuana. He then paid a smuggler to guide him to California.
San Diego’s draw lies in part because Tijuana is the largest city on the Mexican side of the border, U.S. officials say. People of nearly 100 nationalities have arrived at Tijuana’s airport this year, including 12,000 each from Colombia and Cuba, about 6,000 each from Haiti and Venezuela and thousands more from Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, China and Mauritania.
“It’s the prevalence of social media,” said Paul Beeson, whose 33-year Border Patrol career included stints as chief agent in the San Diego, Tucson and Yuma, Arizona, sectors. “There’s a lot more information out there about getting across. Air transportation has picked up and people are able to move around.”
Migration in San Diego presents a challenge because people come from a wider variety of countries — including India, Georgia, Egypt, Jamaica and Vietnam — where deportation flights can be costly and difficult to arrange, U.S. officials say. Mexicans, who are deported nearby over land, and Guatemalans and Hondurans, whose governments have long accepted frequent deportation flights, are a smaller presence there than elsewhere on the border.
The Border Patrol has been busing and flying some migrants from San Diego to other border cities for processing, a role reversal from even last year, when migrants were sent to San Diego to deal with overflow.
Migrants wait hours for agents to pick them up for processing instead of dayslong delays that were common when makeshift camps started popping up in the San Diego area about a year ago. Last month a federal judge said children in the camps were subject to custody standards guaranteeing their health and safety.
One night last week, about 70 people gathered between two walls near an upscale outlet mall. Two Honduran women were no longer able to walk after being injured while scaling the border wall; one accepted a Border Patrol ride to the hospital.
“Almost every night we have injuries from people jumping,” said Clint Carney, 58, who volunteers many nights answering migrants’ questions and serving snacks.
Near Jacumba Hot Springs, a town of less than 1,000 people, about a dozen people from Latin American countries arrived at a fork in a dirt road around 10 p.m. About 100 Chinese migrants came just before sunrise, many neatly dressed and playfully taking pictures on their phones.
Some of the Latin Americans grumbled quietly when the Chinese lined up ahead of them as Border Patrol vehicles arrived. Previously agents issued colored wristbands that were used to keep track of how long people had been waiting and who was next in line, but that practice was stopped in December.
Such staging areas have popped up in remote areas after migrants cross the border where mountainous terrain has prevented barrier construction. Mexican authorities’ increased presence in some areas pushed traffic elsewhere in the sparsely populated desert, creating new camps. One new site is a short distance from a gun club, without tents, bathrooms or other services.
San Diego shelters have been unable to house everyone who is released by the Border Patrol with notices to appear in immigration court. San Diego County Supervisor Jim Desmond said more than 143,000 migrants have been released on the streets since Sept. 13, citing Border Patrol data.
From a bus and trolley station where agents leave migrants, it is a short ride to the airport, where they can charge phones and use restrooms before boarding flights to destinations elsewhere in the U.S.

5998,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-07-02,"Net Zero: explained
One of the issues mentioned in the 2024 general election campaign was whether political parties would stick to the UK’s 2050 ‘Net Zero’ greenhouse gas emissions target, and how they planned to achieve this.
In the past we’ve seen several claims on the impact of achieving Net Zero, including some from the then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, when, in autumn 2023, he announced a new approach to achieving the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions targets.
Mr Sunak said at the time this was a “more pragmatic, proportionate and realistic approach to achieving Net Zero that eases the burdens on working people”. Others were critical of what they suggested was a “watering down” of the UK’s Net Zero policies.
But what is Net Zero, and what are the political parties saying about it? This article looks at what we mean by Net Zero, whether the UK is on track to meet its climate targets, and what the parties said about this during the election campaign.
This explainer is one of a series Full Fact is publishing exploring a range of key political topics. We’ll be updating these articles on a regular basis—this article was last updated on 19 July 2024 and the information in it is correct as of then.

What does ‘Net Zero’ mean?
The concentration of greenhouse gases, gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide, methane and others, contributes to global warming. The objective of Net Zero is to reduce the amount of these gases in the atmosphere in order to reduce global warming.
Reaching Net Zero means achieving a balance between greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of these gases removed from the atmosphere by either natural processes such as photosynthesis, or by other methods of carbon capture and storage, leaving ‘net zero’ in the atmosphere. The UK’s legal target, set in 2019 by Theresa May’s Conservative government, is to achieve Net Zero carbon emissions by 2050.
How do you achieve Net Zero?
There are several policies proposed for achieving Net Zero. These include methods for both reducing emissions produced by human activity and increasing the amounts of carbon absorbed from the atmosphere.
Reducing emissions presents a lot of policy choices. About a quarter of the UK’s emissions come from transport, using estimates from 2021, with other key areas including the energy sector (20%), businesses (18%) and households (16%).
Emissions might be reduced by phasing out the use of fossil fuels and increasing the use of renewable sources of energy, such as wind or solar power, for example.
Carbon emissions from transport can also be reduced by measures including increasing the use of electric vehicles on the roads and further electrification of rail travel. An additional means of reducing emissions is by increasing the efficiency of domestic energy use, such as through improving home insulation and the installation of domestic heat pumps.
The other side to the equation is increasing the amounts of carbon absorbed from the atmosphere. One common method of carbon removal is through planting more trees. Restoring other natural environments, such as peatlands, can also increase the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed from the atmosphere.
What is the government obliged to do?
Under the Climate Change Act 2008, the government is required by law to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The government is also required to publish carbon budgets every five years setting out caps on emissions.
In addition, in 2016, the UK signed the Paris Agreement. Signatories to the agreement have pledged to keep the level to which global temperatures are rising to below 2°C and work towards limiting it to 1.5°C.
In 2019, the UK set the current legally binding target to achieve Net Zero emissions by 2050. In 2021, Boris Johnson’s government also announced an interim target to reduce emissions by 78% by 2035, compared to 1990 levels.
The new Labour government said in its manifesto that it was committed to achieving the 2050 Net Zero target. The Conservatives also said this, but other parties, including the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party, have said they want to achieve Net Zero before 2050. The SNP said it shares the Net Zero ambition for Scotland as well, and legislation gives Scotland a target to achieve this by 2045.
By contrast, Reform UK has said it would scrap the 2050 target, arguing that trying to achieve it would damage the UK economy.
The government is also obliged under the Climate Change Act to publish plans about how it intends to achieve Net Zero. In 2022, the then Conservative government (under Mr Johnson) lost a case in the High Court and was ordered to update its climate strategy, because it did not include adequate information on how Net Zero would be achieved. Rishi Sunak’s government lost a similar case in May 2024, when the High Court found its plans were not sufficient to meet its obligations under the Climate Change Act.
Is the UK currently on course to achieve Net Zero?
The UK’s carbon emissions have been, for the most part, gradually falling since 1990. But independent monitors of government progress are concerned that the target won’t be met.
In February 2024, Mr Sunak’s government announced the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2022 were 50% lower than they had been in 1990. This is based on the UK’s ‘territorial’ emissions. Territorial emissions are used to track the UK’s progress towards meeting its Net Zero target. They include all the emissions within the UK’s borders but don’t include those produced by UK businesses abroad, and any emissions from international air travel and shipping.
Some of the most significant progress has been in emissions from coal, which have almost completely disappeared following the closure of coal power stations in recent years.
Despite the reductions that have taken place since 1990, the government’s independent watchdog, the Climate Change Committee, said in its most recent annual report it was not confident the UK was on course to meet its targets for achieving Net Zero. It said there was a “lack of urgency” in the approach of Mr Sunak’s government, and that that government needed to do more to support the transition away from high carbon emitting industries, including fossil fuel production.
It also said the then government needed to provide households with more advice and support to help them reduce their energy use.
Campaigners including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace UK have also said the UK should do more in order to achieve Net Zero, including increasing the speed of the transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy and improving energy efficiency.
Critics of the Net Zero target have argued the transition to renewable energy will damage the UK economy and make it less competitive with other countries.
We haven’t fact checked this argument, and the economic costs and benefits of this transition will be uncertain given the variety of different factors at play.
The Office for Budget Responsibility does warn that the costs of unmitigated climate change would be much larger than bringing emissions to Net Zero, although it also acknowledges the UK remains a small contributor to global emissions."

A microbiome transplant could help people with bacterial vaginosis
Microbes are important in the gut, skin, mouth — and in the vagina.
Postdoctoral research scientist Fatima Aysha Hussain says that unlike our gut, a healthy vaginal microbiome is likely one with a low diversity of microbes. ""In the gut, the more diversity you have, the more different bacteria are there to break down different foods you're eating. But in the vaginal microbiome, we want a lower diversity state,"" she says, which helps lower inflammation.
Research on the vaginal microbiome has shown that people with a high diversity of microbes are more susceptible to bad health outcomes, like sexual transmitted infections, cervical cancer, pre-term birth and bacterial vaginosis, a common, uncomfortable condition where certain microbes grow more than others. Bacterial vaginosis can be hard to treat — up to 50 percent of cases come back in a matter of months and antibiotics are often ineffective long term.
Hussain is trying to change that with a vaginal microbiome transplant study. She and her team are recruiting both donors and recipients to test whether fluid from a ""healthy"" vaginal microbiome transferred to someone living with recurrent bacterial vaginosis can prevent the infection from coming back.
She recently completed a small safety study with promising results. Two of the four people who received a transplant not only switched from a high to a low diversity ""healthy"" microbiome, but ""it stayed that way for up to six months,"" says Hussain.
She hopes that a larger study will help scientists understand the vaginal ecosystem better in order to one day design more effective therapies for bacterial vaginosis.

Experts say people cannot create or meaningfully alter hurricanes through existing weather modification techniques. That has not stopped a deluge of social media posts baselessly claiming or implying that Hurricanes Helene and Milton were intentionally created, steered or otherwise controlled by someone.
Full Story
Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida on Sept. 26, followed by Hurricane Milton on Oct. 9. Amid the deaths and destruction from the hurricanes, social media posts spread bogus claims that someone had caused or altered the storms via some weather modification technique.
There is a real history of weather modification efforts, with some modest results in producing snow and rain through a technique called cloud seeding. However, it has never been shown to be possible to meaningfully modify hurricanes, nor is there any basis for the idea that someone manipulated Hurricanes Helene or Milton.
“Hurricane Helene was NOT a ‘naturally occurring’ weather event,” said some of the many baseless posts on the topic. “This event was entirely MANIPULATED by man, & guided into a certain direction, for a certain reason.”
While many posts were vague about who had purportedly controlled the hurricanes, others pointed a finger at the U.S. government.
“A hurricane as weather warfare,” read one post. “If you want to argue with me I’m happy to bury you in patents, gov contracts and tax dollars. You are looking at one of the most horrific events ever perpetrated by our government on its own people.”
Claims about Helene then morphed into claims about Milton. “Hurricane Milton is targeted geo-engineered storm being used as a weapon,” wrote Stew Peters, an internet personality who has spread numerous conspiracy theories, in an X post.
Among those adding fuel to these claims was Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who unleashed a series of X posts implying purposeful modification of the storms. “Yes they can control the weather,” Greene posted on Oct. 3. “It’s ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can’t be done.”
Greene, who is a Republican from Georgia, which has been affected by the storms, didn’t explain who “they” are or why someone would want to cause a devastating hurricane. But earlier that day she had posted a map that has been connected to a claim that Hurricane Helene was targeted to disproportionately affect Republicans. In the days since, as another hurricane headed toward Florida, Greene continued to post about weather modification, doubling down on her suggestion. She has a history of spreading conspiracy theories and other misinformation, including about natural disasters.
Not only is there zero evidence that anyone attempted to alter the paths of the hurricanes, but it is implausible that someone could modify a hurricane, let alone in such a way to target specific groups.
“There is no scientific proof that any weather modification has been successful in hurricanes,” Katja Friedrich, who studies cloud and precipitation formation and modification at the University of Colorado Boulder, told us in an email.
President Joe Biden referenced Greene’s claims in an Oct. 9 press conference, saying the idea that “we’re controlling the weather” is “beyond ridiculous.” He continued, “It’s got to stop. In moments like this, there are no red or blue states.”
Greene also made fun of people who have implicated climate change in the hurricanes, ridiculing the idea that “cow farts” could cause them. Other social media posts also dismissed climate change as a possible contributor to the hurricanes, claiming, for instance, that “[w]eather modification crimes [are] hiding behind the label of Climate Change.”
But there is a good case that climate change made various aspects of Hurricanes Helene and Milton worse, and it’s clear that climate change will influence hurricane activity over the coming years. (Also for the record, methane emissions from livestock do contribute to climate change, but the majority of the methane produced by cows is emitted via burps, not farts.)
“Climate change didn’t cause these storms to occur but it plausibly altered the odds of them reaching certain thresholds of intensity, rapid intensification, or rainfall rates, for example,” Tom Knutson, a senior scientist at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told us in an email.
Hurricane Modification Claims Lack Any Basis
People have a long history of trying to change the weather — not all of it well-intentioned — but the successes are limited.
Many posts, including some by Greene, mentioned or linked to sources referencing cloud seeding, the primary method used for weather modification.
In some U.S. states and countries, governments, utilities and companies pay for cloud seeding to enhance the snowpack in the mountains or to increase rainfall in dry regions. The technique relies on adding small particles to clouds to stimulate ice crystals or droplets to form, which can fall to the ground as rain or snow. In the U.S., ground-based machines or airplanes generally release silver iodide, nudging nearby clouds to release snow.
There have been questions about how well these programs work, since it can be hard to tell whether rain or snow after these operations would have fallen anyway. However, a 2018 study by Friedrich and her colleagues indicated that cloud seeding really can cause snow to fall, although it is unclear how much the technique can increase snow in various situations.
The method is not used to control hurricanes. “There is no way that these storms underwent cloud seeding,” Friedrich said.
Cloud seeding would not change the track of a weather system, she said. She explained that the technique “usually focuses on enhancing precipitation in precipitating clouds (rain or snow) and in breaking up large hailstones into smaller ones in thunderstorms to make them less impactful.” Nor have there been any experiments showing “cloud seeding in hurricanes produce more or less precipitation,” she said.
The U.S. government did try to use cloud seeding to mitigate hurricanes at various points beginning in the 1940s and ending in 1983 — a fact referenced by social media posts and in a Gateway Pundit article shared by Greene. But there isn’t evidence these programs were effective at modifying hurricanes, and some results initially interpreted as successes did not pan out.
The U.S. government also tried to secretly use cloud seeding to create extra rainfall and disrupt enemy supply chains during the Vietnam War, ultimately leading to an international treaty banning use of weather modification for military reasons. This history was also referenced in recent posts on weather modification, although it’s not clear whether this operation met its intended goal.
Citing a 2013 interview with physicist Michio Kaku on CBS News that has previously been misinterpreted, Greene also brought up the idea that lasers could control the weather. But Jérôme Kasparian, a physicist at the University of Geneva who has researched using lasers to increase rainfall and modify the path of lightning, told us that initiating and maintaining a hurricane using lasers would not be possible. “You would need to manipulate amounts of energy that are completely beyond what you could do,” he said.
Moreover, his own research on weather modification using lasers has been experimental, he said, and is not ready for routine use. “To the best of my knowledge the most advanced work in this direction with lasers is ours,” Kasparian said of his attempts to nudge clouds to produce rain with lasers. “We are far from getting raindrops,” he said, adding that his efforts to guide lightning with lasers also needs “a lot of work and development.”
Finally, some posts referenced the High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program at the University of Alaska Fairbanks as a purported weather modification technique. But HAARP is a basic science research program aimed at understanding the highest parts of the atmosphere using radio waves. It has nothing to do with weather modification and could not alter hurricanes.
“Radio waves in the frequency ranges that HAARP transmits are not absorbed in either the troposphere or the stratosphere—the two levels of the atmosphere that produce Earth’s weather,” says an FAQ page on the HAARP website. “Since there is no interaction, there is no way to control the weather.”
Climate Change Is Real, Can Affect Hurricanes
Social media posts have also used the bogus claims about intentional weather modification as an opportunity to dismiss the reality of human-caused climate change.
As we have written many times, heat-trapping greenhouse gases produced by human activities have warmed the planet, leading to a variety of climate effects. The relationship between climate change and hurricanes is complex, but rising global temperatures already have influenced and will continue to influence Atlantic hurricanes.
Climate change causes sea level rise as hotter temperatures melt land ice and water warms and expands. Sea level rise, in combination with more coastal development, increases the risk of large storm surges and damage from hurricanes. Human-caused climate change has already elevated sea levels, and this has “very likely increased the impact of hurricanes relative to the case without sea level rise,” Knutson, the NOAA scientist, told us.
Climate change is also expected to lead to more intense Atlantic hurricanes, meaning hurricanes with greater wind speeds. And it has already boosted extreme rainfall, since warmer air holds more moisture — and possibly contributed to an increase in rapidly intensifying hurricanes — although this is not certain. Knutson said climate change potentially impacted Helene and Milton in each of these ways.
In the past, it was difficult to say whether and how climate change affected a particular storm, but increasingly, scientists are performing so-called attribution studies to quantify those impacts.
Several preliminary assessments of Hurricane Helene have been released, connecting the “catastrophic impacts” of the hurricane to climate change. Each report has found that climate change increased the storm’s total rainfall, and of the two reports that assessed wind speeds, both found that climate change made the hurricane more intense. An early report on Hurricane Milton similarly indicated that climate change made the hurricane wetter and windier.

In an exploration of the World Economic Forum’s Young Global Leaders (YGL) program, we can scrutinize the profound influence that the alumni of this prestigious initiative wield in shaping global narratives and policies.
The program, under the stewardship of the German, Klaus Schwab, meticulously selects individuals displaying exceptional leadership potential across various sectors.
While ostensibly aimed at fostering a cohort committed to improving the state of the world, a darker interpretation might question the concentration of power and influence among a select few and its implications for global democracy and autonomy.
Let’s not lose touch…Your Government and Big Tech are actively trying to censor the information reported by The Exposé to serve their own needs. Subscribe now to make sure you receive the latest uncensored news in your inbox…
A Closer Look at the Dystopian Influence
Emmanuel Macron, Justin Trudeau, and Jacinda Ardern stand as emblematic figures of the YGL’s success in placing its alumni in pivotal positions of power.
These leaders, with their progressive policies and charismatic leadership, also embody the subtle, pervasive influence of a global elite network.
Critics from a dystopian perspective might argue that their ascension reflects not just individual merit but the power of elite grooming and networking, raising concerns about the democratic process and the diversity of thought in global leadership.
Emmanuel Macron
France’s youngest President, Macron’s rapid ascent from a relatively unknown government official to the pinnacle of French politics, could be seen as illustrative of the YGL program’s influence.
His tenure has been marked by efforts to reform the French economy and strengthen the European Union.
However, viewed through a dystopian lens, Macron’s leadership also highlights the challenges of globalism, with widespread protests and social unrest under his administration signalling a disconnect between the unelecterd global elite’s vision and the populace’s realities.
Justin Trudeau
Canada’s Prime Minister, Trudeau, renowned for his commitment to issues like climate change, gender equality, and refugee rights, also exemplifies the global leadership ideal promoted by the YGL.
Yet, critics might point to his administration’s controversies, including ethics violations and criticisms over the handling of indigenous rights and environmental policies, as indicative of the complexities and contradictions that arise when global leadership ideals confront national and local realities.
Jacinda Ardern
Ardern’s empathetic and authoritarian leadership, particularly in the aftermath of the Christchurch mosque shootings and during the COVID-19 pandemic, has been lauded globally.
Nonetheless, from a dystopian perspective, her rise and the adulation she receives could be perceived as emblematic of a broader trend towards a global consensus on leadership and policy-making, potentially stifling dissent and alternative approaches to governance.
The Dystopian Nightmare
In this dystopian vision, the YGL program, while fostering unparalleled innovation and collaboration, also inadvertently cultivates a homogenized class of global leaders.
This elite cadre, connected by shared experiences and ideologies, may inadvertently sideline diverse voices and perspectives, leading to a world where policies and priorities are increasingly disconnected from the grassroots.
This concentration of power among a global elite could raise existential questions about sovereignty, autonomy, and democracy.
The influence wielded by the World Economic Forum’s YGL alumni, capable of transcending national borders and influencing global policy, underscores a tension between global governance ideals and the principle of self-determination.
Conclusion
While the World Economic Forum’s Young Global Leaders program undeniably contributes to developing talented individuals capable of addressing complex global challenges, a dystopian interpretation invites reflection on the implications of such concentrated influence.
It urges us to consider the balance between global leadership and local accountability, the diversity of thought in the corridors of power, and the sanctity of democratic processes in an increasingly interconnected world.
This exploration serves both as a condemnation and as a reminder of the need for vigilance in how we cultivate and empower the next generation of leaders.
After all, Klaus Schwab recently confirmed that the World Economic Forum is infiltrating governments worldwide as we speak.

(Salvatore Di Nolfi/Keystone via AP)
GENEVA (AP) — Member countries kicked off the World Health Organization’s annual assembly on Monday with hopes of improving global readiness for deadly outbreaks like COVID-19, after an ambitious “pandemic treaty” ran aground last week.
Health officials are racing to get the world to agree to new ways to prepare for and fight an inevitable future pandemic. COVID-19 is fading into history as elections and crises like climate change and war compete for the public’s attention.
A bold project to adopt a pandemic “treaty” at this week’s World Health Assembly was shelved on Friday as 2 1/2 years of work ran into disagreements over sharing information about pathogens that cause pandemics and the technology used to fight them.
Experts say the best chance now to address pandemics at the assembly will be proposed changes to the WHO’s International Health Regulations, which were set up in 2004. Amendments would urge countries to boost alert, detection and containment capacities and cooperate internationally.
One proposal would let the WHO director-general declare a “pandemic emergency.”
Envoys say a deal is close, but similar disagreements between rich countries and developing ones that set back the pandemic treaty negotiations linger. Issues remain over proposed “transfer of technology” and the creation of a new fund under WHO in 2030 that would help boost pandemic-fighting capacities “particularly in developing countries.”
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus insists the stalled work on the pandemic treaty was not a failure, and acknowledged an “immense” task on a “very ambitious timeline” — alluding to the many years it usually takes for U.N. member countries to reach global treaties.
“Of course, we all wish that we had been able to reach a consensus on the agreement in time for this health assembly and cross the finish line,” Tedros said in opening remarks. “But I remain confident that you still will — because where there is a will, there is a way.”
“It’s now for this World Health Assembly to decide what that way is — meaning the solution is in your hands,” he added.
The premise is that pathogens that have no regard for national borders require a united response from all countries. But decision-makers have struggled to balance national interest with the call from WHO officials to think more broadly in the interest of humanity.
Health ministers now have to try to overcome deep-set differences, including how the world can share information on emerging pathogens and scarce resources like vaccines when demand skyrockets.
“If nothing comes out of WHA (the assembly), it’s a huge missed opportunity,” said Yuanqiong Hu, a senior legal and policy adviser at Doctors Without Borders, “If they don’t come up with a clear road map, how are they going to finish this process?”"
3929,fake,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-10-15,"Peter Vlaming, formerly an employee of the West Point School District, received a $575,000 payout, which one right-leaning media outlet said has ""seismic implications"" for the rest of Virginia's educational system as the transgender virus continues to spread far and wide.
Vlaming was represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) whose president and CEO Kristen Waggoner issued a statement about how her organization is ""grateful that, because of this decision, tolerance is now a two-way street, not a one-way ratchet for totalitarian ideology.""
""It protects all teachers in Virginia and its rationale should guide other courts addressing similar issues,"" she added about the settlement ruling.
(Related: Did you hear about Irish teacher Enoch Burke who was arrested recently for refusing to address one of his male students as ""she"" and ""her?"")
Vlaming is hardly the only teacher to face mistreatment for refusing to play ball with the Cult of LGBT. Many other teachers, including some who are represented by the ADF in other states, face similar persecution for doing what is right.
""No teacher should be fired for living according to their [sic] beliefs or protecting their students,"" Waggoner wrote on X / Twitter. ""But that's exactly what happened to Peter Vlaming. So we sued. And won.""
In addition to receiving a $575,000 cash settlement, the West Point School District's board also cleared Vlaming's termination from his employment record as well as altered its policies on gender pronoun tyranny to comply with the updated Virginia education policies established by Republican Gov. Glenn Younkin.
The West Point School District clearly violated Vlaming's right to free speech – or in this case, his right to not be forced to utter someone else's preferred speech. As such, the school district was held accountable in a court of law for this infringement.
""Peter wasn't fired for something he said; he was fired for something he couldn't say,"" commented senior counsel Tyson Langhofer, director of the ADF Center for Academic Freedom, in a statement. ""The school board violated his First Amendment rights under the Virginia Constitution and commonwealth law.""
""As a teacher, Peter was passionate about the subject he taught, was well-liked by his students, and did his best to accommodate their needs and requests. But he couldn't in good conscience speak messages that he knew were untrue, and no school board or government official can punish someone for that reason. We're pleased to favorably settle this case on behalf of Peter and hope other government and school officials will take note of the high cost involved in failing to respect an American's constitutionally protected freedoms.""
Before winning the settlement, Vlaming's case was tossed by a judge in the King William Circuit Court who declared that Vlaming, a Christian, should not be protected because there is no ""valid reason for the law to accept his suit.""
Virginia Commonwealth Supreme Court Justice D. Arthur Kelsey later overturned that ruling, writing that Vlaming had valid ""constitutional, statutory, and breach-of-contract claims"" on his former employer.
""Examining only the allegations in Vlaming's complaint, the circuit court dismissed Vlaming's claims, finding that they failed to state legally viable causes of action. Disagreeing with the circuit court, we reverse and remand for further proceedings,"" Justice Kelsey said.
In speaking to the media about his victory, Vlaming said he is ""relieved"" that his rights of freedom of expression and freedom of religion were ultimately upheld.

The US vaccination schedule for infants has increased from 5 injections in 1986 to around 32 today. So why are today’s children and young people sicker than any other generation?
Let’s not lose touch…Your Government and Big Tech are actively trying to censor the information reported by The Exposé to serve their own needs. Subscribe now to make sure you receive the latest uncensored news in your inbox…
In 1986, babies between 0 and 12 months old in the United States were given around five vaccines.
This year, babies between 0 and 12 months old in the United States are given around 32 vaccines.
And, of course, all those vaccines are given to keep children healthy.
So why, just out of curiosity, are today’s children and young people sicker than any generation since cholera, tuberculosis and other nasties were major killers at the end of the 19th century?
The evidence shows that vaccines did NOT get rid of the infectious diseases which used to kill so many. It was cleaner water, better food, better housing and better sewage disposal which produced the improvements. Just look at the facts.
Could it possibly, just possibly, be that all those injections are making children sick? Is it possible that the epidemic of diseases now affecting children could be a result of all that vaccination?
Well, I think there’s a link.
But because that’s my viewpoint I am banned from every corporate media outlet in the world. I am banned from all social media and from just about every broadcaster on the internet. No one dares interview me because if they do, they’ll be closed down. There are politicians who want critics of vaccination to be classified as terrorists.
However, let me tell you something else.
No one has done experiments to see if it is safe to put so many potent and potentially dangerous vaccines into small and growing bodies.
You might think they’d do that. It is well known that individual vaccines can and do cause serious health problems. There is a mass of evidence proving that vaccines can do serious harm. And governments have paid out billions to families of vaccine-damaged children.
But they don’t.
Are the words “mass vaccination” and “genocide” pretty much interchangeable?
I couldn’t possibly comment.
If you want to know more please read my book `Anyone who tells you that vaccines are safe and effective is lying.’ Joe Biden’s White House tried to get the book banned. But the last time I looked it’s still available. You can buy a copy HERE.

6174,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-10-10,"Hundreds of viruses live on showerheads and toothbrushesOctober 10, 2024
Hot showers are great, but you're not the only organism bathing in the warming wash of water — new research from the US has found diverse communities of viruses are dwelling on your showerhead too.
Apparently, that's good news.
""The number of viruses that we found is absolutely wild,"" said Erica Hartmann of Northwestern University, a microbiologist who led the study.
""We found many viruses that we know very little about and many others that we have never seen before. It's amazing how much untapped biodiversity is all around us. And you don't even have to go far to find it; it's right under our noses.""
Or bathroom faucets, it seems.
Viruses are most often associated with the diseases they cause in humans and other animals. However, not all viruses are pathogenic in humans and can provide useful services to science.
Most of the viruses identified in by Hartmann and her team are known as bacteriophages. Rather than being a hazard to humans, these phages infect bacteria.
In the newly published study in the journal Frontiers in Microbiomes, Hartmann's research group observed that most Americans spend two-thirds of their lives in their homes, and so learning about the organisms that occupy this shared space is valuable to understanding the quality of living spaces.
What's living on your toothbrush?
To understand the makeup of viral communities, the researchers used previous data obtained by citizen science projects that swabbed showerheads and toothbrushes in US homes. They then assessed the makeup of these environments, finding very different microbial communities in each location.
While viruses are usually considered to exist in a kind of living-dead nether zone, where they require a living host to reproduce and, occasionally, cause harm, they nevertheless inhabit many different environments in complex communities.
Inside American bathrooms, Hartmann's team found more than 600 unique viral species living on showerheads and toothbrush bristles.
Their diversity was such that no one showerhead community matched any other. The same went for comparisons between the toothbrushes.
It's hoped that the bacteriophage viruses identified by her research group could open new avenues for bacterial infection treatments and serve as a more appropriate way to cleanse environments without antimicrobial products.
""The more you attack them with disinfectants, the more they are likely to develop resistance or become more difficult to treat,"" said Hartmann.
""We should all just embrace them. Microbes are everywhere, and the vast majority of them will not make us sick.""
Showerhead bacterial communities are a different story
It should come as little surprise that watery environments are brimming with life. After all, water is top of the search list for scientists looking for life on other planets.
As well as viruses and bacteriophages, these bathroom surfaces can also harbor bacteria and fungi, as discovered by other research efforts.
Three years ago, Hartmann's group started its research into the topic, dubbing it ""Operation Pottymouth"" as it tried to investigate the long-held claim that flushing a bathroom toilet sends a haze of fecal aerosols onto your toothbrush.
That claim, they argued, probably wasn't true. Instead, most toothbrush bacteria appeared to come from its user's mouth.
In 2018, results from the Showerhead Microbiome Project found associations between mycobacterium-infected showerheads in American and European bathrooms and prevalence of lung infections.
Fortunate, then, that Hartmann's latest research found the bacteriophages most commonly found in these environments tend to target harmful mycobacteria.
""We could envision taking these mycobacteriophage and using them as a way to clean pathogens out of your plumbing system,"" Hartmann said.
""We want to look at all the functions these viruses might have and figure out how we can use them.""

5671,fake,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-11-01,"Moscow Warns German Arms Factory In Ukraine Is ‘A Legitimate Target’
The Dusseldorf-based German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall this week announced that it has completed delivery of twenty more 20 Marder 1A3 infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) to Ukraine.
But its relationship with Kiev has gone much further, becoming among the very first major European arms companies to open a factory in Ukraine. This has provoked outrage among Kremlin officials, who are now warning that military action could be taken against the Rheinmetall plant.
Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov has told reporters in a briefing that “A plant of Rheinmetall, a German arms manufacturer, launched in Ukraine, is a legitimate military target for the Russian Armed Forces.”
“Certainly it is,” he emphasized in response to a question on whether the factory is now a target by being established inside Ukraine.
Not only is the German company going to produce armored vehicles, and maintain and repair them from inside the war-ravaged country, but it is even seeking to develop a local gunpowder and munitions plan.
TASS notes that Rheinmetall is NATO member Germany’s largest defense contractor. “It substantially profits from the Ukrainian conflict and anticipates further increased revenues. In 2023, its turnover went up by 12%, to 7.1 bln euros, with its net income growing by 9%, up to 0.6 bln euros,” the report reviews.
Rheinmetall has indicated it eventually plans to open no less than four military production installations inside Ukraine, with the ammo side expected to begin within the next two years.
The company downplayed the Tuesday threat from Peskov, saying the “production of weapons in Ukraine is well protected and this is not the first time they have heard threats from the Kremlin.” It plans to move forward despite the threats.
Among Russia’s key rationales for the February 2022 invasion was to ‘demilitarize’ Ukraine amid accusations that NATO is building up its military infrastructure inside the country which shares a large border with Russia. But now it appears the Western military alliance is rushing to do just that.
CEO of Rheinmetall AG, Armin Papperger, issued the following statement earlier this week: “Things are progressing. The first plant is already ready. The second one is on the way. And now I insist on speeding up all of this work, because we don’t have much time, we shouldn’t waste it.”
Papperger added, “We are fully committed to supporting Ukraine’s defense industry, ensuring that essential equipment can be produced and maintained within the country.”
Pro-Russian pundits have underscored that this makes peaceful settlement more & more unlikely:
No one doubts this. I hope that Russia will not be satisfied with such a “peace” with Ukraine.
“Ukraine will continue to arm itself, increasing its stockpiles of ammunition and equipment, even in the event of a peaceful settlement of the conflict,” Armin Papperger, head of the… pic.twitter.com/KfK982IQax

This past summer US intelligence officials made an astounding claim, later denied by Russia:
U.S. intelligence discovered that Russia planned to assassinate the chief executive of German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall which has been producing artillery shells and military vehicles for Ukraine, CNN and the New York Times reported on Thursday.
The plot to kill Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger was one of a series of Russian government plans to assassinate defense industry executives across Europe who were supporting Ukraine’s war effort, CNN reported, citing five unidentified U.S. and Western officials as saying the plot was discovered earlier this year.
Ukrainian officials and media have hailed the strong support from the German arms giant, saying of factory development in the country, “One down, three to go.” It remains uncertain what NATO would do in the event its factories are actually targeted, given this could induce Brussels to invoke Article 5."

While previous deadly drugs caused enormous scandals in their day – think of Thalidomide, for instance – nobody is allowed to talk about the fact experimental mRNA vaccines have killed an extraordinary number of people.

Big Pharma and the global elite have blood on their hands and they are using mainstream media to whitewash and cover up the greatest crime in history.
They cannot be allowed to get away with this crime – especially when Pfizer’s own documents reveal the hidden truth about the shocking extent of the carnage.
Before we dive in, subscribe to the channel if you haven’t already, and join the People’s Voice Locals community to join our incredible community and support the channel.
World-renowned OBGYN physician Dr. James Thorp has blown the whistle on the massive cover-up, warning the public about the disturbing numbers that governments, Big Pharma and the mainstream media are working overtime to keep hidden from the public.
During an interview with Infowars host Alex Jones, Dr. Thorp explained that in the first ten weeks of the mRNA vaccine rollout, “there were 42,086 casualties,” more than enough to have the product recalled and banned, like Thalidomide in the early 60s after the drug caused deformities in 10,000 children.
However, the shocking mRNA data was suppressed by Big Pharma and the mainstream media and the mass vaccination push continued with tragic consequences of historic proportions.
As Dr. Thorp explains, “if you calculate the injured-to-kill ratio, it’s unprecedented in warfare and medicine.”
Despite the carnage, the elite are pressing full steam ahead with their plans to inject the global human population with as many mRNA “vaccines” as possible.
Here is Moderna CEO Stephan Bancel shamelessly promoting his vaccines and the company’s new pivot to cancer treatment to capitalize on the explosion in turbo cancers in the wake of the mRNA vaccine rollout.
Unelected world health czar Bill Gates is also refusing to acknowledge the carnage caused by mRNA, beating the drum for his new generation of injectibles, declaring that mRNA will solve every problem known to man.
Remember, Gates developed a “vaccine” to protect against vaccine-induced polio.
If that doesn’t tell you everything you need to know about this sociopath and vaccines, then nothing will.
If you are still not convinced these men need to face justice in the form of crimes against humanity charges, wait until you see Pfizer’s own data that puts the scale of the genocide into historical context.
While Big Pharma and the mainstream media continue to suppress real news about mRNA, Pfizer’s own legally mandated 90-day post-rollout document known as Pfizer 5.3.6 puts the tragedy into context.
Published online following orders by a federal judge, this Pfizer document is available to the public – but of course the media has done everything they can to suppress knowledge about what it contains.
Remember when former CNN host Chris Cuomo attempted to convince the masses that it was illegal to read WikiLeaks emails that exposed Hillary Clinton and John Podesta?
The mainstream media’s dirty tactics haven’t changed. They are still determined to pull the wool over the eyes of the public.
This page shown in the video above proves that Pfizer’s experimental mRNA vaccine is not only the deadliest drug ever rolled out, it is also, as Dr. Thorp explained earlier, the most injurious drug in human history.
For every death, more than 33 people have been injured by the vaccine. Remember this is Pfizer’s own data.
It is important to place this medical holocaust into a historical perspective.
The first column shows the damage caused by the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. There were about 94,000 injured and 105,000 killed for an injure-to-kill ratio of approximately 0.9.
Now look at the middle column – Thalidomide. Before mRNA, Thalidomide was the deadliest drug in the history of medicine. The word still sends shivers down spines and rightfully so. Yet compared to the mRNA vaccines, Thalidomide was nothing. There were 20,000 injuries and 80,000 deaths for an injure-to-kill ratio of 0.25.
Now fast forward to 2021 and Pfizer’s experimental mRNA. They have killed 17 million global citizens. And these are just the ones they have admitted to.
Now, remember this drug is not only the most deadly in world history, it is by far the most injurious. So how do we work out the official Pfizer-admitted number of global injuries caused by their mRNA vaccine?
The injure-to-kill ratio is 33.4 to 1. Multiply 33.4 by 17 million, the number of official dead, and that makes 567 million global citizens that have been injured.
Add the number of dead and injured together for a total of 585 million global citizens killed and maimed by Pfizer.
If you have ever wondered if what happened in Nazi Germany could ever happen again, the last 4 years basically answered your question. Most people were basically on the side of the Nazis.
Take Chris Cuomo, for instance. The former CNN hack spent the pandemic shilling for Pfizer and urging Americans to get vaccinated, boosted, wear masks, and obey every authoritarian order the government issued.
Fast forward three years and Cuomo now understands he was nothing more than a useful idiot.

6172,fake,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-05-20,"After a years-long battle with the school system and Maryland parents, a federal court has decided that despite parents' concerns and religious conflicts, parents are not allowed to choose to opt their children out of learning about progressive ideologies and topics in schools. Remember: to the left, your children belong to them.
Last, parents from the Montgomery County Public School (MCPS) started publicly fighting back against the progressive lessons being taught to their elementary-aged students. In March of 2023, the school district essentially declared that they wouldn’t tell parents prior to teaching lessons or reading books to students about progressive ideologies or agendas. Kids in the school system are now being read books like “The Pride Puppy,” “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding” and “Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named Penelope,” as Fox News reported. They’re also being exposed to themes like drag queens, furries and other queer crap.
Parents insisted, and rightfully so, that these books and the ideologies they promote were inappropriate for young kids, and forcing them to listen to or read them would violate said children’s First Amendment right to free exercise of religion by intentionally teaching them ideologies that are antithetical to the tenets of their religion.
“The parents had argued that refusal to provide an opt-out from their children’s exposure to LGBT-themed books and related discussions violates federal and state law,” Fox News reported.
The plaintiffs, one Muslim and two Christian, worked with The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty to sue MCPS.
Late last week, the Court of Appeals decided in a 2-1 vote that simply exposing kids to these progressive ideologies isn’t enough to constitute a breach of the First Amendment.
“The board argues that exposure to ideas contrary to one’s faith is not enough of a burden to implicate the First Amendment,” the court decision read, adding, “the board contends that exposure to issues that one disagrees with, even for religious reasons, is part of the compromise parents when choosing to send their children to public schools.”
So essentially, they’re our kids now. Homeschool if you don’t like what we’re teaching."

The long-term consequences of Covid-19 vaccination are now being realised…
Over a year ago, double vaccinated Australians were 10.72x more likely to catch Omicron than the unvaxxed. Now they are 20x more likely and the triply or more vaxxed are 35x more likely, as the latest NSW Health stats show (see below).
Meanwhile, the latest Cleveland Clinic Data and the latest US data analysed by Josh Stirling, founder of Insurance Collaboration to Save Livess and former #1 ranked Insurance Analyst, shows a really really disturbing trend.
The damage to health caused by each vaccine dose does not lessen over time. It continues indefinitely.
In fact, CDC All-Cause Mortality data show that each vaccine dose increased mortality by 7% in the year 2022 compared to the mortality in year 2021.
So if you have had 5 doses then you were 35% more likely to die in 2022 than you were in 2021. If you have had one dose then you were 7% more likely to die in 2022 than you were in 2021. If you are unvaxxed then you were no more likely to die in 2022 than you were in 2021.

By a concerned reader
The Cleveland Clinic Data
Here are the Covid infection rates for the 1st 98 days from 2022September12, when the bivalent vaccine was first offered to Cleveland Clinic employees. It was not mandated. It was offered.
So on 2022September12, 6199 employees were unvaxxed, 2359 were single jabbed, 13804 were double jabbed, 20798 were triple jabbed and 3538 were quad jabbed or penta jabbed with the original vaccine, which was designed against the Wuhan Hu1 reference virus, which was NOT isolated from a Human but was generated on a computer.
The results of their study, shown graphically above, demonstrate that the more doses of the original vaccine you took, the more likely you were to catch covid. In other words the original Covid vaccine is not merely ineffective against Omicron. It is actually anti-effective.
It is therefore not a vaccine against the present strain of Covid. It is an antivaccine. It damages your immune system in a dose-dependent manner. The more shots you took, the more damage you will have done to your immune system.
The writer first saw this from PHE Vaccine Surveillance reports and published his findings to PHE themselves AND on my website and in The Expose, on 2021October10.
‘The Science’ has now been established by the Cleveland Clinic. Genetic vaccines damage your immune system and make you not less likely but more likely to be infected with Covid.
Not only that but they have horrendous side effects on the cardiovascular, neurological and reproductive systems as well.
They are nothing short of mandatory progressive euthanasia.
CDC All-Cause Mortality Data shows that every year, every vaccinated person becomes more and more likely to die at a rate of 7% PER JAB PER YEAR. That is a slow-acting genetic poison.
If people were recovering from the 1st jab, then it would not be having precisely the same effect as the 5th jab (namely a 7% increase in mortality). This is the long term problem. People are not recovering from the damage done by the shots in terms of excess mortality.
So taking 2021 as the base line, a 5 dosed person would be 350% more likely to die in 2031 and 700% more likely to die in 2041 and 1050% more likely to die in 2051 than an unvaxxed person. It is just like compound interest.
Using this result, we can calculate the loss in life expectancy for a 30 year old male as follows… The life expectancy of a 30 year old unvaxxed male in the UK is around 80 years. So he can expect another 50 years of life.
In statistical terms, half of his cohort are dead by 80. The life expectancy of a 30 year old quintuply vaxxed person in the UK is 56 years. Assuming UK males respond to the vaccines in the same way as US people. Alternatively quintuply vaxxed US 30 year old males have likewise lost 24 years of life expectancy.
UK life expectancy data is from Statista. In the table below we add the extra 7% mortality per jab per year to the 2020 UK levels shown in Column2. So in a 5 year period, the average increase in expected mortality would be –
- (0% + 35%)/2 = 17.5% from one jab
- (0% + 70%)/2 = 35% from two jabs
- (0% + 105%)/2 = 52.5% from three jabs
- (0% + 140%)/2 = 70% from four jabs
- (0% + 175%)/2 = 87.5% from five jabs
1 jab robs 30 year old men of 13 years
2 jabs robs 30 year old men of 18 years
3 jabs robs 30 year old men of 20 years
4 jabs robs 30 year old men of 23 years
5 jabs robs 30 year old men of 24 years
That is the price you pay for trusting the NHS, trusting the government and trusting the BBC and the Main Stream Media.
That is what Media like the Expose have been trying to prevent.

NSW Covid ICU admissions 2022Nov19-Dec31
NSW Covid Hospital admissions 2022Nov19-Dec31
There is the proof of immune system destruction by vaccination mediated spike proteins. We see the same pattern for Hospital admissions in Australia as we see for infection rates in Cleveland. The more shots you take the weaker your immune system becomes. And that is for the target of the therapy! The above graphs do NOT address any of the side effects.
Conclusion
The population of NSW in Australia is 6½ million people. They are a highly vaccinated group. Looking at the Australian Government data for the last 6 weeks of 2022 we see that.
1. Those with 1 or 2 doses are 20x more likely to be admitted to hospital with Covid than those with no doses.
2. Those with 3 or 4 or more doses are 35x more likely to be admitted to hospital with Covid than those with no doses.
3. Being unvaxxed provides 100% protection from having to go to the ICU. Being vaxxed gives you a 6 in 100,000 chance of being hospitalised in the ICU.
4. Vaccines are unsafe and extremely ineffective.
5. COVID-19 vaccination is putting unsustainable pressure on hospitals and ICUs in NSW and by implication all over the world.
6. The NHS in the UK will be destroyed unless vaccinations are banned immediately. It may already be too late.
7. The vaccines prevent herd immunity. Herd immunity will never be reached in the vaxxed. It has already been reached in the unvaxxed
8. The continuation of the pandemic is entirely caused by the anti vaccines.
The last time I looked at the data in NSW, for the last 6 weeks of 2021, the double vaxxed were 2.18x more likely to catch Omicron than the unvaxxed.
Here were are today, 12 months later in the last 6 weeks of 2022, and the double vaxxed are not 2.18x, but actually 20x more likely to catch the latest variant. And the triple jabbed are 35x more likely!
So there is the immune system destruction that I predicted in October2021. There is the progressive vaccine-mediated AIDS. These are farcical Monty Python kinds of numbers. As I understand it the Australian government is now going to stop classifying hospital data by vax status.
Talk about bury your head in the sand. In any event. It is too late. The cat is out of the bag. These figures are an accelerating immunological catastrophe.
The data we have analysed are for the disease that the vaccines are supposed to be protecting us from (Covid-19). They do not address the plethora of cardiovascular, neurological, immunological, reproductive and systemic side effects of the genetic anti vaccinations which cause further hospital admissions.
We have given control of our Health Services big pharma and they have destroyed those services. The day will come, if it has not already, when 50% of the patients in our hospitals are suffering from vaccine-mediated pathology.
The question then becomes, how many others in addition to the vaccine damaged are suffering from Big Pharma-mediated pathologies resulting from other Big Pharma ‘medications’?
The credibility and the viability of all health care worldwide is therefore entirely dependent upon the immediate cessation of genetic vaccination.

2449,real,INSTITUTIONAL_AND_MEDIA_DISTRUST_PUBLIC_INSTITUTIONS,2024-05-27,"Around 1.6 million out of the 27.6 million-strong electorate were allowed to cast their ballots early, according to South Africa's Independent Electoral Commission (IEC).
Election agents will visit 624,000 people with mobility issues at home, while essential workers will attend polling stations two days earlier than the general populace.
On Wednesday, the rest of the country will be called to vote in South Africa's sixth general election, three decades after the advent of democracy in 1994.
The vote could prove a historic turning point if, as opinion polls predict, the ruling African National Congress (ANC) loses its absolute parliamentary majority for the first time.
At no point since world media beamed iconic images of Black South African voters queueing to cast ballots 30 years ago for the first time following the end of white-minority rule has the ANC looked so likely to lose its parliamentary majority.
Polls suggest the ANC's share of the vote could fall as low as 40%, compared with 57.5% in 2019, which would force the party into a wobbly coalition with rivals – and potentially expose President Cyril Ramaphosa to a leadership challenge.
Monday's early voting followed a weekend of final campaigning by South Africa's four main political parties.
'We will do more and we will do better'
ANC supporters gathered at a football stadium in Johannesburg on Saturday to hear a speech by Ramaphosa and senior party leaders.
As thousands of supporters in the ANC's black, green and gold colours attended its last major rally before the election, Ramaphosa recognised some of the grievances of South Africans, which include high levels of poverty and unemployment that mainly affect the country's Black majority.
“We have a plan to get more South Africans to work,"" Ramaphosa said. “Throughout this campaign, in the homes of our people, in the workplaces, in the streets of our townships and villages, so many of our people told us of their struggles to find work and provide for their families.”
The president won cheers as he pledged not to scrap black economic empowerment programmes and suggested a possible raise in grant money for the poor.
""We will do more and we will do better,"" the 71-year-old millionaire former businessman told the crowd, branding the ANC ""the only political party in the whole of South Africa that can bring so many people together in one place"".
""We gather here carrying together the hopes and aspirations of millions,"" he said. ""Our people will decide whether our country continues to move forward with the ANC to a brighter future or turns back to a terrible past.""
Opposition campaigns for change
The main opposition Democratic Alliance party had a rally in Cape Town, South Africa's second-biggest city and its stronghold, on Sunday.
Party leader John Steenhuisen made a speech while supporters in the DA's blue colours held up blue umbrellas.
“Democrats, friends, are you ready for change?” Steenhuisen said. The crowd shouted back “Yes!”
Sunday's rally coincided with that of the smaller opposition Inkatha Freedom Party, which has the populous KwaZulu-Natal province as its stronghold and has committed to work with the main opposition.
A coalition between the DA and other parties including the Patriotic Alliance in the Johannesburg council after the 2021 local government elections collapsed, handing power back to an ANC-led coalition and resulting in political animosity between the two parties.
Speaking ahead of its final rally in the city of Richards Bay in KwaZulu-Natal on Sunday, Inkatha Freedom Party leader Velenkosini Hlabisa said their main objective was to see the current government removed.
“The IFP is campaigning to remove the ANC from power and become part of the government at a policy making level and also cut the ANC to below 50% at national level.”
“We are calling on people to take action and vote IFP to remove the government that has failed them,” said Hlabisa.
He said most negotiations would take place after the results were in. Hlabisa highlighted unemployment, poverty, crime and the country's electricity crisis as some of the major problems South Africans are facing.
“We all know the crisis we are facing, we all know the depth of the struggle in South Africa and the daily trauma so many people endure. What the country needs to hear is that there is a way out,” he said.
The far-left Economic Freedom Fighters had their last big pre-election gathering in the northern city of Polokwane, the hometown of fiery leader Julius Malema. “The people of South Africa must decide if they want unemployment,"" Malema said.
The new MK Party of former South African president and former ANC leader Jacob Zuma was also campaigning in a township just outside the east coast city of Durban, although Zuma didn't attend the event. The 82-year-old Zuma rocked South African politics when he announced late last year he was turning his back on the ANC and joining MK, while fiercely criticising the ANC under Ramaphosa.
Zuma has been disqualified from standing as a candidate for Parliament in the election because of a previous criminal conviction, but MK is still allowed to use his image as its leader and he continues to campaign. His daughter, Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, attended the rally, where MK followers chanted: “Run, Ramaphosa, run.""

4359,real,GENDER_BASED_DISINFORMATION,2024-02-21,"Planned Parenthood, the leading proponent of abortion in America, has written on their website, “Medication abortion is really safe and effective. It’s a super common way to have an abortion, and millions of people have used it safely.” Planned Parenthood broadcasts that abortion is a “right,” that any method of terminating a baby in the womb is safe, and that complications are “extremely rare.”
However, several experts have pointed out that Planned Parenthood — along with other businesses that carry out abortions — are especially prone to dressing up poor or false data, research, and arguments to serve their agenda.
Chemical abortion has become a focal point in this debate, since its use has spiked significantly since Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022.
The abortion drug mifepristone has been strongly promoted as an alternative to women who want an abortion but live in pro-life states. Women are told that the abortion pill is safe and easy, as it can be done in one’s own home. Several universities across America have required access to the abortion pill, and as potential restrictions to the pill circulate in the media, research has revealed that women have stocked up on it “just in case.”
But medical professionals and pro-life advocates are trying to bring awareness to research that reveals chemical abortion is anything but safe.
Many women have shared their testimonies from using the abortion pill. Kelly Lester, Outreach Director for And Then There Were None, talked openly about her pain after four abortions. “The abortion pill was the worst,” she insisted. “Women aren’t getting the full story.” Like so many others, Lester said her experience is one of grief and agony. But these testimonies are ignored by mainstream media.
Nature Medicine recently released a study that claimed “99.8% of abortions were not followed by serious adverse events.” But with an abundance of evidence that contradicts such a claim, can the results from this study be trusted? “[A]re these claims truthful, or are the researchers in this study blind to the very real dangers of the drug to the mothers?” asked Tony Perkins, president of Family Research Council, on Monday’s edition of “Washington Watch.”
Dr. Ingrid Skop, vice president and director of medical affairs at the Charlotte Lozier Institute, highlighted the flaws in this study. The fact that the outcome of at least a quarter of the women involved was unknown “should disqualify the study,” she said. “If you don’t know what happened to one out of four women, you cannot assume that those were uncomplicated.”
Skop, who is also a fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said she’s seen “so many women harmed by abortion drugs,” adding that what she’s seen on the ground is proof that it’s not safe. “This study is the latest in a long series of demonstrations that the pro-abortion medical organizations and the pro-abortion scientific journals are now publishing what they know is poor quality research in order to promote abortion ideology,” she said.
According to Skop, the Charlotte Lozier Institute conducted its own research, collecting data from women in states that allow Medicaid to pay for abortion. She said their study found “one out of 20 women after abortion drugs” went to “an emergency room with a complication related to those drugs within a month.”
She continued, “That’s very high quality data. We didn’t lose patients to follow up. And yet our studies have been targeted, and these other studies that are obviously just ideologically driven have been allowed to pass without any scrutiny from the pro-abortion media.” And she stressed that even the complications that commonly follow abortions are also ignored in these studies. “Because it doesn’t fit the narrative,” Perkins added. “[I]t doesn’t fit the push that this administration is involved in [by] trying to make these abortion pills available through the mail.”
Ultimately, they agreed that the truth about the harms of abortion must continue to be voiced, especially when studies such as the one published by Nature Medicine push false inferences. “We just need to keep fighting for women and their unborn children,” Skop concluded.

Editor’s Note: Why Is This News Biblically Relevant?
Sarah Holliday, in her article, “Dangerous Devaluing Of Life: Women Are Stocking Up On Abortion Pills Amid Fears Of Restriction,” highlighted:
Mary Szoch, director of the Center for Human Dignity at Family Research Council, commented to The Washington Stand that this increase in demand for at-home abortion pills further demonstrates how the abortion movement harms women, not protects them. “The acceptance of artificial birth control spread the lie that the purpose of sex is not unity and procreation, but instead, just pleasure.”
She continued, “It has [led] to the devaluing, and even hatred of, the natural consequence of sex — children.” In Szoch’s opinion, children are particularly hurt because they “are no longer viewed as a gift from God, but instead, as objects whose existence depends solely on a man’s or a woman’s will for them to exist.” As such, “God’s will is completely removed,” she added, and women stock up on pills that have the power to exterminate the children they fear they’ll conceive"

The Pfizer covid-19 vaccine contract between the Canadian government obtained by The Canadian Independent shows the “long-term effects, efficacy, and adverse effects” of the vaccine were not known at the time the contract was signed and the population was mass vaccinated.
This is the original covid-19 vaccine contract between the Canadian government and Pfizer, dated 26 October 2020. It was obtained exclusively by The Canadian Independent through an access to information request.
Two months later, after the contract was signed, Canada began the process of mass vaccinating its citizens while politicians, public health officials, the CEO of Pfizer, and the mainstream media preached about the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine being “safe and effective.”
What the population was not aware of was what was in the contract.

5699,fake,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-05-19,"05/19/2024 / By Ethan Huff
The only way to save the planet from getting too hot and melting is to kill off millions or even billions of people with another “pandemic,” according to Prof. Bill McGuire, a well-known vulcanologist and climate scientist.
On X, McGuire tweeted a controversial message stating that the only “realistic” way to reduce emissions as substantially and quickly as he feels is needed to save the world from climate change and “avoid (a) catastrophic [climate] breakdown” is “the culling of the human population by a pandemic with a very high fatality rate.”
Within hours of tweeting this, McGuire deleted it – not because he regretted it, mind you, but because he received so much public backlash that he could no longer take the heat.
“RIGHT,” McGuire screamed in his following tweet. “I AM DELETING THE INITIAL TWEET NOT. NOT BECAUSE I REGRET IT, BUT BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE HAVE MISTAKENLY, OR INTENTIONALLY, TAKEN IT THE WRONG WAY.”
(Related: Back in December, the head of COP28 told a crowd that there is “no science” out there to back phasing out fossil fuels in order to stop global warming.)
McGuire did not get off the hook for the first tweet as easily as he had hoped by tweeting the second one. Meteorologist Chris Martz (@ChrisMartzWX) responded to McGuire by explaining that nobody “took it the wrong way.”
“It was crystal clear,” Martz added about what McGuire said in his original tweet. “You believe the best way to ‘save the planet’ is to reduce the human population, but you don’t want to volunteer to go first and lead by your own example because you think your existence is superior to everyone else.”

“And to the folks reading this, academic institutions you send your children to for a higher education are infested with dangerous people with this mentality. They hate you.”
Dr. Aaron Thierry also responded to McGuire by expressing dismay over his original message. “The argument is baseless, but worse it’s a remark that bolsters eco-fascism.”
“I bet you were disappointed when The Covid® turned out to be a big flop,” wrote another.
McGuire responded again to all this by claiming that everyone criticizing him “can’t read.”
“I SAID ‘THE ONLY WAY I SEE EMISSIONS FALLING AS FAST AS THEY NEED TO …,'” McGuire wrote, again in an all-caps online yelling voice. “I DID NOT SAY ‘WE NEED A PANDEMIC …'”
“I COULD HAVE SAID SOCIETY-BUSTING ASTEROID IMPACT INSTEAD OF PANDEMIC.”
To be fair, McGuire did not explicitly state that he is rooting for another “pandemic” or an asteroid to strike and take out the world. He seems to be implying it, but he was never so direct like that and is now denying it. At the same time, he dug his own grave even deeper with his follow-up tweet about an asteroid impact.
Numerous people responded to his second tweet by stating that McGuire’s language is suggestive that he wants a big catastrophe to happen in order for the planet to stay protected from melting due to emissions.
“I’m convinced that people like McGuire and other climate catastrophists are actually rooting for the end of the world,” wrote Rick Moran for PJ Media. “They dream of melting glaciers, rivers flooding across the land, oceans covering skyscrapers, and Middle America becoming a desert.”
“Just think of all the room they’d have then. No need to rub elbows with the riff-raff and the plebes. Just McGuire and his fellow climate alarmists sitting among the ruins congratulating themselves on being so right.”

3764,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-06-19,"Dayling Ramírez says that each day that passes is a challenge to overcome because, despite having survived the persecution of the Mara Salvatrucha gang and the abuses in an immigration station in Mexico, Ramírez hasn't yet fully integrated into the country’s society.
“We trans people have a hard time getting hired. It’s horrible. Here you survive if you are a stylist or if you are a prostitute, otherwise not. They don’t give you work,” said Ramírez, 36, a Honduran trans woman who lives in Mexico City.
Mexico has become one of the largest migratory corridors in the world. In fiscal year 2023, U.S. Customs and Border Protection recorded 2,045,838 encounters on the U.S. border with Mexico. So far in 2024, the figure already stands at 1,160,805. In this vast flow of migrants, the LGBTQ community is increasingly present in Mexican territory.
""The presence and visibility of the LGBT migrant population in transit has become increasingly visible in Mexico,” said Ana Guadarrama, general coordinator of Mexico's National Network of Support for LGBT Migrants and Refugees.
Guadarrama and other experts said that the increase in the arrival of LGBTQ migrants can be traced to 2013 but, above all, to after 2017, when the first Trans Gay Migrant Caravan was formed.
""We have seen an increase because the presence and visibility of gay men and trans women is undoubtedly much greater, whether in specifically LGBT care spaces or in a general way within the programs that provide support to the population in transit in the country,” Guadarrama said.
A new campaign led by the Organization for Refuge, Asylum and Migration, or ORAM, which assists LGBTQ asylum-seekers, has launched a campaign in Mexico to raise money to offer safe shelter, food and transportation for a month to 100 LGBTQ refugees or asylum-seekers in Mexico City.
“We always think of Mexico as the country from which migrants leave for the United States, but it has already become a place where people from other places pass through on their way to the United States, Canada or even people from the LGBT community who see Mexico as an opportunity to have a life that is a little safer, a little freer,” said activist Enrique Torre Molina, a member of the ORAM board.
Torre Molina said the idea is to raise 400,000 Mexican pesos (about $21,670) to help 100 migrants for 30 days, through organizations that have physical spaces such as shelters and houses where they receive LGBTQ people, migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers.
In the last three years, Mexico has recorded 231 murders of LGBTQ people: 78 in 2021, 87 in 2022 and 66 in 2023, according to data from Letra S: Sida, Cultura y Vida Cotidiana, a civil organization dedicated to the defense of LGBTQ people, which has recorded such cases since 1998.
On average, six people were killed every month. However, Letra S’ investigation says that figure doesn't reflect actual numbers, because many murders aren't covered by the media, nor are they reported to the authorities.
""We have become a country where there are more and more migrants and refugees. And when migrating or passing through Mexico, in addition to the violence, the insecurity of organized crime and the threats that any migrant or refugee experiences, the LGBT community faces additional discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity,"" Torre Molina said.
In March, the United Nations Refugee Agency published a report surveying more than 15,000 migrants who crossed Mexico last year. It found 56% of migrants who participated in the surveys said they suffered some type of abuse, such as robbery or physical threats
The civil association Stop Kidnapping reported 772 migrant kidnappings last year. As of March of this year, it had recorded 521 kidnappings, more than half of which were of undocumented people.
“We are a community that experiences discrimination and violence. In some cases, LGBT people are in danger precisely because of the rejection of their sexual orientation or gender identity, and this affects migrants or refugees differently. Sometimes it is not that these people decide to migrate but that they are forced to cross an international border, looking for a safe place and freedom,” Torre Molina said.
The 'triple vulnerability' of LGBTQ migrants
For Dana Graber Ladek, head of mission of the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration, or IOM, an important aspect of LGBTQ migrants who arrive in Mexican territory is the “triple vulnerability” they suffer.
“First, they are stigmatized because of their sexual orientation or gender identity and second because they are migrants. Furthermore, many of these people are in an irregular situation — they are not documented in the country — so that is like a triple vulnerability that they experience in Mexico,” she said.
Several researchers, including Graber Ladek, say one of the LGBTQ migrant population's big problems is the absence of more data and information about them.
""The great challenge we have in Mexico, and also in other countries in the region, is to understand the statistics and characteristics of this population, because they really are invisible people who migrate in an irregular, undocumented way,"" she said. ""So there are more challenges in terms of understanding where they are, what their priorities are, their interests, etc. And the National Migration Institute is not collecting this data from migrants.""
The IOM does conduct surveys that ask about issues of sexual identity or gender identification to understand what challenges such migrants face.
Noticias Telemundo contacted Mexico's National Migration Institute and the Interior Ministry for access to the most recent data on the LGBTQ migrant population, but spokespeople for both institutions didn't immediately respond.
In the absence of figures, various organizations offer their internal data to show the increase in the LGBTQ migrant population in Mexico. That is the case for the National Network of Support for LGBT Migrants and Refugees, which in 2021 responded to requests from 150 LGBTQ migrants, 300 in 2022 and 368 last year. So far this year, it has already assisted 250 people.
“Recognizing ourselves within statistics is a fundamental step for the possibility of creating public policies, programs and services that meet needs,"" Guadarrama said. ""If we do not have that information, many of the actions or services that we are being generated, they are not reaching the populations.""
For now, ORAM’s campaign to offer shelter and help to LGBTQ migrants in Mexico City continues and has the support of people like Ramírez who experienced firsthand the difficulties of arriving in a big city without knowing anyone.
“I have experienced so many things here. I was in many shelters, I had to get involved in prostitution and I was mistreated, beaten — I was even kidnapped,"" she said. ""This project is going to help a lot so that people can find a safe place where they will not be discriminated against and can have a roof over their heads and a plate of food, even if it is for a few days. There are opportunities, but you have to fight for them, and I would not like them to experience everything that I have experienced."""

(AP Photo/Arnulfo Franco, File)
WASHINGTON (AP) — The climate phenomenon known as El Nino — and not climate change — was a key driver in low rainfall that disrupted shipping at the Panama Canal last year, scientists said Wednesday.
A team of international scientists found that El Nino — a natural warming of the central Pacific that changes weather worldwide — doubled the likelihood of the low precipitation Panama received during last year’s rainy season. That dryness reduced water levels at the reservoir that feeds freshwater to the Panama Canal and provides drinking water for more than half of the Central American country.
Human-caused climate change was not a primary driver of the Central American country’s unusually dry monsoon season, the World Weather Attribution group concluded, after comparing the rainfall levels to climate models for a simulated world without current warming.
The study has not been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal yet but follows scientifically accepted techniques, and past such studies have frequently been published months later.
“Natural variability plays a critical role in driving many extremes,” said Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at Brown University, who was not involved in the study. “This is an important reminder that climate change isn’t always the answer.”
Panama experienced one of its driest years on record last year, receiving below-average rainfall for seven of the eight months of its May to December rainy season.
As a result, since last June, the Panama Canal Authority has restricted the number and size of ships passing through the Panama Canal due to low water levels in Lake Gatun, the canal’s main hydrological reserve. Global shipping is still being disrupted.
To test whether climate change had a role, the team of scientists analyzed weather data against computer simulations precise enough to capture precipitation in the region. Such models simulate a world without the current 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since preindustrial times, and see how likely the lack of rainfall would be in a world without fossil fuel-charged warming.
The climate models did not show a trend similar to the drying that Panama experienced last year. In fact, many models show a wetter trend in the region due to climate change from carbon dioxide and methane emissions produced by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.
Meanwhile, the analysis showed that El Nino reduced the 2023 rainfall by about 8%, and that it’s unlikely Panama would have experienced such a dry rainy season without the influence of the weather phenomenon. The researchers said increased demand for water in the region worsened the shortfall.
The group used more than 140 years of rainfall records collected from 65 weather stations — a “statistician’s dream,” said Clair Barnes, a researcher at Imperial College of London and one of the study’s authors.
“So we’re very confident that El Nino is driving the low precipitation,” said climate scientist Friederike Otto, also of Imperial College, who coordinates the attribution study team.
The World Weather Attribution group launched in 2015 largely due to frustration that it took so long to determine whether climate change was behind an extreme weather event. Studies like theirs, within attribution science, use real-world weather observations and computer modeling to determine the likelihood of a particular happening before and after climate change, and whether global warming affected its intensity.

As is a common theme behind the “climate change” agenda, local and indigenous people suffer at the hands of those who seek to capitalise on the natural world and profit from it.
We’ve previously brought attention to the damage and harm climate change profiteers are causing in Africa and elsewhere. In a recent newsletter, Axios highlights the plight of people living in the Amazon basin or Amazonia.
Amazonia is the largest river basin in the world, and its forest stretches from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the tree line of the Andes in the west. Approximately one-fifth of all freshwater runoff on Earth passes through this watershed. It includes roughly 60 per cent of the world’s rainforest. Parts of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela lie within the Amazon’s basin.
Through the “climate change” agenda, Amazonia has newly found financial wealth due to the climate change cult’s fixation on contrived carbon emissions and its ugly twin, carbon trading schemes.
When you have people living in poverty sitting on top of vast wealth, the wealth almost always ends up getting realised, one way or another. The indigenous tribes, and the Amazon itself, invariably end up much worse off as a result.

Climate Hypocrisy Takes Centre Stage in the Amazon
The following was originally published by Axios Markets as part of its newsletter for 5 April 2024.
South America’s Amazon region, while extremely poor, sits on hugely valuable natural resources. The resulting tensions between environmentalists and wealth seekers are exploding once again.
Driving the news: The president of Guyana, Mohamed Irfaan Ali, went viral this week for a video in which he lectured a BBC journalist on hypocrisy around climate change.
The developing world, he says, has no right to lecture him about the carbon emissions from offshore oil drilling when those countries had been emitting vast amounts of carbon for centuries during which Guyana itself was consistently carbon-negative.
The big picture: Whether or not Guyana drills for oil is very unlikely to meaningfully change the total global demand for oil or the total amount of carbon produced by burning oil.
It will increase carbon emissions attributable to Guyana – but Guyana also has a desperate economic need to be able to provide a reliable electricity supply to its citizens and companies.
Now it’s going to be able to do that by piping in natural gas from the oilfields and then using that gas to power the national grid.
Zoom out: The Amazon provides Guyana not only with a certain amount of moral high ground when it comes to climate change but also with cash; in 2009, for instance, Norway paid Guyana some $250 million to continue to avoid deforestation.
That number pales in comparison, however, to the amount of money Guyana stands to make from offshore oil drilling. The country has already received $3.5 billion from ExxonMobil and stands to make much more in the future.
Zoom in: Across the border with Brazil, environmentalists are fighting – with guns! – criminal garimpeiros, miners drilling for gold and cassiterite, who are threatening the livelihood of the indigenous Yanomami tribe.
In a report for the New Yorker about a special-forces unit of armed environmentalists, reporter Jon Lee Anderson unpacks a lot of the complex politics involved in the region.
One of his interviewees was a Brazilian judge, Luís Roberto Barroso, who tried to intervene to protect the Yanomami.
What they’re saying: “There is an inescapable reality,” Barroso told Anderson, “which is that you have people living in poverty sitting on top of vast wealth.”
When that happens, the wealth almost always ends up getting realised, one way or another. The indigenous tribes, and the Amazon itself, invariably end up much worse off as a result.
Go deeper: In the New York Times, Gaiutra Bahadur asks, in another deeply reported story, whether Guyana’s oil is a blessing or a curse.

3945,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-09-30,"AAP FACTCHECK – Products must be deemed toxic to be approved by health regulators as medication, a social media user has claimed.
This is false. A level of toxicity is not a prerequisite for approval by regulators.
Nevertheless, experts told AAP FactCheck, all products are toxic at a certain level anyway.
The claim appears in a Facebook reel in which an Australian user talks about laboratory testing for medicines.
“You probably haven’t heard of lethal dose 40,” she says in the video.
“Lethal dose 40 or LD40 is the measure that indicates the dose of a substance that is lethal to 40 per cent of a test population, usually rats or mice, in drug testing.
“It’s one of the prerequisites for the development and approval of prescription medications.
“So, a product that has zero toxicity and causes no harm will not get approval by regulatory bodies as a medication.”
AAP FactCheck contacted the user and asked for clarification and for evidence to support the claim. The user did not respond.
Lethal dose 40 and, more commonly, lethal dose 50 (LD50) are experiments used in toxicology to find the dose that would kill 40 or 50 per cent of animal test populations (usually rats and mice).
A spokesperson from Australia’s medicine regulatory agency, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), told AAP FactCheck not only is toxicity not a minimum requirement but LD levels have no regulatory value for medicines.
“All substances, whether they are used in medicines or not, can cause harm,” the spokesperson said.
“However, medicines can be used safely if consumers follow the instructions on the label or the directions of their healthcare professional.”
According to the TGA, LD values, which are usually expressed as mg/kg bodyweight of a substance given in a very short period, are one way to indicate the acute toxicity of substances.
However, they are not required by the agency.
“All substances can have an LD50 value – even water,” the spokesperson added.
The TGA, like other international regulators, relies on a different value – the NOAEL (No Observed Adverse Effect Level) – for human medicines.
This value is the dose at which no adverse effect was detected in test animals after repeated administrations.
It’s extrapolated for use in humans after allowing for the variability between animals and humans.
Paul White, from Monash University’s pharmaceutical sciences department, said the claim is based on a misunderstanding of LD levels by suggesting “that there could be a drug, or natural product for that matter, that has no toxicity”.
“There is no such thing as ‘a product that has zero toxicity and does no harm’,” Professor White said.
“If the dose is high enough there will be toxicity for any administered substance – that includes oxygen!”
Prof White said first-year pharmacology students are taught the famous quote on the basic principle of toxicology from Swiss physician and chemist Paracelsus from 500 years ago: “All things are poison and nothing is without poison; only the dose makes a thing not a poison.”
The Verdict
Misleading – The claim is accurate in parts but information has also been presented incorrectly, out of context or omitted.

This is just another confirmation that corporate America is all about shoving their LGBT agenda down everyone’s throat.

Target may have downshifted when it came to pushing the gay agenda, so Walmart is stepping in.

Washington Examiner reports:
Walmart could be the next target of criticism from conservatives, as the shopping giant has unveiled a new collection of LGBT merchandise by partnering with gay- and lesbian-owned companies.
The items, which range from clothes and hats to school supplies and pool floats, are part of the retailer’s Pride Always collection.
“We couldn’t be prouder of this year’s LGBTQIA+ founders & designers,” a social media post from Walmart reads. “Today. Tomorrow. Always.”
Some of the items available for purchase can only be bought online, while other items are being made available both online and in stores.
The unveiling of Walmart’s collection follows rival Target’s announcement that it plans to scale back its LGBT products this year to mostly online sales. The retailer told the Washington Examiner that the collection “has been curated based on guest insights and consumer research.”
In 2023, Target’s Pride collection generated controversy largely because some of it was marketed toward children. As a result, the company either moved its displays of LGBT merchandise to the back of its store or removed them entirely.

Walmart is getting skewered on social media after unveiling its “Pride Always” collection prior to what society has deemed “pride month” in June, as shoppers express disappointment, irritation, and disgust.
“Not just a slogan. #PrideAlways is a reminder to lead with love,” Walmart wrote in the caption of the post, which features a video of the creators behind this year’s collection talking about some of their favorite pieces of its LGBTQIA2S+ apparel:
“So tired of this nonsense. If anyone should have a month of honor it should we for our soldiers, our nurses and police officers. People who actually are making a difference in this world,” one Instagram user wrote.
“Why do we have to care about someone’s sexuality?” another asked as someone else concluded that Walmart “didn’t learn” from the mistakes of Target and Bud Light.
“Walmart and Pride whatever it is, I hate all this because you glorify everything in this world except what God has created to be from the beginning, which is a family, man married to a woman and their children!!” another said, expressing disgust that the core family unit is seemingly never celebrated.
“Why don’t you give a true family unit a special month???” the user continued, questioning why the LGBTQ agenda must be “glorified” for an entire month.
“So Walmart is woke now? How long before you’re selling Palestinian Flags and abortion kits? Totally ridiculous,” another lamented.
“Gross. Pretty much all of this will end up on the clearance aisle,” another said as negative comments poured in the post.
“WOW WALMART. WHAT DON’T YOU CELEBRATE VETERANS ” one said as another deemed the collection “nonsense.”
“No one needs a month of this,” they said as another asked, “Why is this in my feed. I don’t want to [be] forced to accept your lifestyle.”
“A whole month. Yall [sic] are SO oppressed,” another mocked.

Hey there,
Noah here and I hope you are doing great!
Simple question for you today:
Is your hard-earned money going to the wrong people?
Over 90% of the products on store shelves are controlled by the same globalist hedge funds as the big box stores. So ask yourself...does simply changing stores really make a difference? The answer is no.
What if there was a better way you, your friends and family, could shop family-owned?
You know I've got you covered...
You can now partner with a direct-to-consumer company that offers over 450 high-quality, sustainable, non-toxic and effective products directly to your door. And it's often cheaper!
Do business with companies that uphold patriotic and conservative values that your family can respect, rather than supporting these mega-corporations with your purchases!
Great idea, right?
I'm so excited about all of this and I'm hosting two gatherings this coming Tuesday and Saturday to tell you all about it. I hope you can join me?
Join me this coming Tuesday at 8:30pm Eastern, 7:30pm Central here: JOIN ON TUESDAY
Or join me this coming Saturday at 12:00 noon Eastern, 11:00am Central here: JOIN ON SATURDAY
If neither of those work for you, or if you'd prefer a personal phone call, I have a team of Concierge Patriots helping me with this and one of them would be happy to give you a personal call: Yes, Please Have Someone Call Me

3460,real,DISINFORMATION_ABOUT_LGBTQIA_PLUS,2024-06-18,"The senate upper house gave final approval -- by 130 votes to four, with 18 abstentions -- to changes to the marriage law allowing same-sex couples to tie the knot.
The new legislation will now go to King Maha Vajiralongkorn for royal assent and come into force 120 days after publication in the official Royal Gazette.
Thailand will become only the third place in Asia where same-sex couples can get hitched, after Taiwan and Nepal, and activists are hoping the first weddings could be celebrated as early as October.
""Today is the day that Thai people will smile. It is a victory for the people,"" Tunyawaj Kamolwongwat, an MP with the progressive Move Forward Party, told reporters ahead of the vote.
""Today it finally is happening in Thailand.""
The new legislation changes references to ""men"", ""women"", ""husbands"" and ""wives"" in marriage laws to gender-neutral terms.
It also gives same-sex couples the same rights as heterosexual ones when it comes to adoption and inheritance.
Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, who has been vocal in his support for the LGBTQ community and the bill, will open his official residence to activists and supporters for celebrations later.
Activists also plan an evening rally featuring a drag show in central Bangkok, where giant shopping malls have been flying the rainbow flag in a show of support since the start of Pride Month in June.
Long struggle
Thailand has long enjoyed a reputation for tolerance of the LGBTQ community, and opinion polls reported in local media show overwhelming public support for equal marriage.
More than 30 countries around the world have legalised marriage for all since the Netherlands became the first to celebrate same-sex unions in 2001.
But in Asia only Taiwan and Nepal recognise marriage equality. India came close in October, but the Supreme Court referred the decision back to parliament.
""I am so happy to see how far we have come,"" said Chotika Hlengpeng, a participant in the Pride march that drew thousands of enthusiasts in Bangkok early in June.
Tuesday's vote is the culmination of years of campaigning and thwarted attempts to pass equal marriage laws.
While the move enjoys popular support, much of Buddhist-majority Thailand still retains traditional and conservative values.
LGBTQ people, while highly visible, say they still face barriers and discrimination in everyday life.
And some activists have criticised the new laws for failing to recognise transgender and non-binary people, who will still not be allowed to change their gender on official identity documents.

5240,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-08-22,"Aging is a biological process that no one can avoid. Ideally, growing old should be a time to relax and enjoy the fruits of your labor. Aging also has a darker side, however, often linked to disease.
Every second, your cells perform billions of biochemical reactions that fuel essential functions for life, forming a highly interconnected metabolic network. This network enables cells to grow, proliferate and repair themselves, and its disruption can drive the aging process.
But does aging cause metabolic decline, or does metabolic disruption accelerate aging? Or both?
To address this chicken-or-egg question, you first need to understand how metabolic processes break down during aging and disease. I am a scientist and researcher, and my lab focuses on exploring the complex relationship between metabolism, stress and aging. Ultimately, we hope this work will provide strategies to promote healthier aging and more vibrant lives.
Link between metabolism and aging
Aging is the most significant risk factor for many of society’s most common diseases, including diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disorders. A key factor behind the onset of these health issues is the disruption of cellular and metabolic homeostasis, or balance. Disrupting homeostasis destabilizes the body’s internal environment, leading to imbalances that can trigger a cascade of health issues, including metabolic disorders, chronic diseases and impaired cellular functions that contribute to aging and other serious conditions.
Disrupted metabolism is linked to many hallmarks of aging cells, such as telomere shortening, which is damage to the protective ends of chromosomes, and genomic instability, the tendency to form genetic mutations.
A dysfunctional metabolism is also linked to poorly functioning mitochondria; cellular senescence, or when cells stop dividing; imbalances in gut microbes; and cells’ reduced ability to detect and respond to different nutrients.
Neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, are prime examples of age-related conditions with a strong link between dysregulated metabolism and functional decline. For example, my research team previously discovered that in aging mice, the ability of bone marrow cells to produce, store and use energy is suppressed due to increased activity from a protein that modulates inflammation. This energy-deficient state leads to an increase in inflammation that’s worsened by these aging cells’ reliance on glucose as their main fuel source.
Experimentally inhibiting this protein in the bone marrow cells of aging mice, however, revitalizes the cells’ ability to produce energy, reduces inflammation and improves plasticity of an area of the brain involved in memory. This finding suggests that some cognitive aging could be reversed by reprogramming the glucose metabolism of bone marrow cells to restore immune functions.
Repurposing drugs to treat Alzheimer’s
In our newly published research, my team and I discovered a new connection between disrupted glucose metabolism and neurodegenerative disease. This led us to identify a drug originally designed for cancer that could potentially be used to treat Alzheimer’s.
We focused on an enzyme called IDO1 that plays a critical role in the first step of breaking down amino acid tryptophan. This pathway produces a key compound called kynurenine, which fuels additional energy pathways and inflammatory responses. However, excessive kynurenine can have detrimental effects, including increasing the risk of developing Alzheimer’s.
We found that inhibiting IDO1 can recover memory and brain function in a range of preclinical models, including in cell cultures and mice. To understand why, we looked at the metabolism of brain cells. The brain is one of the most glucose-dependent tissues in the body. An inability to properly use glucose to fuel critical brain processes can lead to metabolic and cognitive decline.
High levels of IDO1 reduce glucose metabolism by producing excess kynurenine. So IDO1 inhibitors – originally designed to treat cancers such as melanoma, leukemia and breast cancer – could be repurposed to reduce kynurenine and improve brain function.
Using a range of lab models, including mice and cells from Alzheimer’s patients, we also found that IDO1 inhibitors can restore glucose metabolism in brain cells. Furthermore, we were able to restore glucose metabolism in mice with both amyloid and tau accumulation – abnormal proteins involved in many neurodegenerative disorders – by blocking IDO1. We believe repurposing these inhibitors could be beneficial across various neurodegenerative disorders.
Promoting healthier cognitive aging
The effects of neurological disorders and metabolic decline weigh heavily on individuals, families and the economy.
While many scientists have focused on targeting the downstream effects of these diseases, such as managing symptoms and slowing progression, treating these diseases earlier can improve cognition with aging. Our findings suggest that targeting metabolism has the potential to not only slow neurological decline but also to reverse the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and dementia.
Discovering new insights at the intersection of stress, metabolism and aging can pave the way for healthier aging. More research can improve our understanding of how metabolism affects stress responses and cellular balance throughout life."

Climate change is making giant heat waves crawl slower across the globe and they are baking more people for a longer time with higher temperatures over larger areas, a new study finds.
Since 1979, global heat waves are moving 20% more slowly — meaning more people stay hot longer — and they are happening 67% more often, according to a study in Friday’s Science Advances. The study found the highest temperatures in the heat waves are warmer than 40 years ago and the area under a heat dome is larger.
Studies have shown heat waves worsening before, but this one is more comprehensive and concentrates heavily on not just temperature and area, but how long the high heat lasts and how it travels across continents, said study co-authors and climate scientists Wei Zhang of Utah State University and Gabriel Lau of Princeton University.
From 1979 to 1983, global heat waves would last eight days on average, but by 2016 to 2020 that was up to 12 days, the study said.
Eurasia was especially hit harder with longer lasting heat waves, the study said. Heat waves slowed down most in Africa, while North America and Australia saw the biggest increases in overall magnitude, which measures temperature and area, according to the study.
“This paper sends a clear warning that climate change makes heat waves yet more dangerous in more ways than one,” said Lawrence Berkeley National Lab climate scientist Michael Wehner, who wasn’t part of the research.
Just like in an oven, the longer the heat lasts, the more something cooks. In this case it’s people, the co-authors said.
“Those heat waves are traveling slower and so slower so that basically means that ... there’s a heat wave sitting there and those heat waves could stay longer in the region,” Zhang said. “And the adverse impacts on our human society would be huge and increasing over the years.”
The team conducted computer simulations showing this change was due to heat-trapping emissions that come from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. The study found climate change’s fingerprint by simulating a world without greenhouse gas emissions and concluding it could not produce the worsening heat waves observed in the last 45 years.
The study also looks at the changes in weather patterns that propagate heat waves. Atmospheric waves that move weather systems along, such as the jet stream, are weakening, so they are not moving heat waves along as quickly — west to east in most but not all continents, Zhang said.
Several outside scientists praised the big picture way Zhang and colleagues examined heat waves, showing the interaction with weather patterns and their global movement and especially how they are slowing down.
This shows “how heat waves evolve in three dimensions and move regionally and across continents rather than looking at temperatures at individual locations,” said Kathy Jacobs, a University of Arizona climate scientist who wasn’t part of the study.
“One of the most direct consequences of global warming is increasing heat waves,” said Woodwell Climate Research Center scientist Jennifer Francis, who wasn’t part of the study. “These results put a large exclamation point on that fact.”

3474,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-10-14,"Five more bird flu cases suspected among California dairy workers amid outbreak
Five more people who presumably contracted the bird flu are being tested amid outbreaks in California's dairy industry, health officials confirmed Monday.
The five new possible positive cases are located in the state's Central Valley and are pending testing, according to the California Department of Health.
There are total of six confirmed cases in the state as of Monday, the department said in a news release. The individuals had direct exposure to infected dairy cattle at nine different farms and are experiencing mild symptoms like eye redness or discharge (conjunctivitis). No one has been hospitalized.
The health department said the specimens are expected to arrive for testing at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention early this week.
""Given the amount of exposure to infected cows, evidence continues to suggest only animal-to-human spread of the virus in California,"" the health department wrote. ""Based on CDC’s genomic sequencing of three California bird flu cases, there is no evidence to suggest an increased ability for the virus to infect or spread between people.""
Risk to general public is low
California officials said the risk to the general public remains low but warned that those who ""interact with infected animals are at higher risk of getting bird flu.""
There are no known links between the six confirmed cases, which suggests there is widespread transmission among dairy herds and that the infected cattle pose risks to people working near them.
One of the newly identified people who tested positive worked on the same farm as a previously infected person, but they worked in different areas of the facility and were not in close contact, the CDC said.
20 positive bird flu cases this year
Officials have identified 20 people across the U.S. infected with bird flu this year. Nearly all of them worked with infected dairy or poultry livestock. However, one person infected in Missouri has no known source of transmission, according to state and federal officials.
Blood test results are pending for close contacts of the person in Missouri, who had been hospitalized with the virus. The contacts include several health workers who treated the person for bird flu. Some of those workers came down with mild respiratory symptoms, but state and federal officials stressed there wasn't evidence of human-to-human transmission, which would mark a shift in virus transmission.
There are 100 dairy herds in central California that have reported confirmed cases of bird flu in cattle, the CDC said. The increase in infected cows on California farms has significantly altered the number of herds nationally with the virus. Nearly 300 herds across 14 states have confirmed bird flu cases.
Workers urged to wear N95 respirators, face shields
Health officials recommend livestock workers wear personal protective equipment, including N95 respirators, goggles, face shields and gloves.
The CDC is also ramping up its efforts to vaccinate livestock workers, who are at greater risk of contracting bird flu, against seasonal influenza.
Seasonal flu vaccines do not provide protection against bird flu. However, officials fear that a cross-reaction of both influenza viruses in the body can cause bird flu to mutate to spread more easily or cause serious illness.
The federal government has also stockpiled emergency bird flu vaccines. Those vaccines have not been used yet."

The Interior Ministry added on September 19 that it had detained a 26-year-old man suspected of carrying out the deadly attack. A case was launched initially into a ""premeditated homicide,"" but later the crime was redefined as a ""premeditated homicide under aggravating circumstances."" If convicted, the suspect faces life in prison. The attack took place one day after Georgian lawmakers approved laws curbing LGBT rights that allow for bans on cultural events such as Pride marches."
2187,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-05-07,"Ukraine says it has foiled a Russian plot to assassinate its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and other senior officials, using a network of agents who were recruited by Vladimir Putin’s domestic spy agency.
The SBU state security service in Kyiv said the alleged agents had been instructed to find someone close to the presidential guard. The person would take Zelenskiy prisoner – in his office or when he left the building – and then kill him, the SBU said.
Zelenskiy’s murder was intended as a “gift” for Putin, the Russian president, who was inaugurated at the Kremlin on Tuesday for a fifth time, it added. The FSB also hatched a plan to eliminate Ukraine’s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, who is a hated figure in Moscow, and the SBU’s head, Vasyl Maliuk, the SBU said.
The agency said three FSB intelligence officers were behind the operation. It named them as Maxim Mishustin, Dmytro Perlin, and Aleksii Kornev, from the ninth department of the FSB’s fifth service. Perlin handled a network of Ukrainian “moles”, recruited before Russia’s full-scale invasion, it added.
One of the alleged Ukrainian agents was a colonel serving in Ukraine’s state guard service. The colonel held several secret meetings with Kornev before 2022, which took place in a neighbouring European country, it said.
It was unclear when the plot to kill Zelenskiy was discovered, but the SBU suggested preparations were well under way. One of the Ukrainian agents received a call from his FSB handler in February 2022 and the next month was instructed to find someone working in Zelenskiy’s immediate entourage who might kidnap and kill him.
The FSB also instructed its network to gather information on prominent Ukrainian politicians, the SBU said. The agency released what it said was an intercepted telephone call between Perlin and one of his alleged Ukrainian contacts. The Russian spy sketched out a complicated plot to assassinate Budanov.
The operation was supposed to take place before Orthodox Easter. A spotter was to keep watch on a house used by Budanov which the Russians intended to hit with a missile strike. An agent nearby would then attack other people at the site using kamikaze drones. A second missile strike would cover up evidence of a drone attack, Perlin said, according to details published by the SBU on Telegram.
The FSB officer reassured his contact in Kyiv that he would have “20 or 30 minutes” to get away from the scene once “visuals” had been confirmed. Perlin referred to the planned missile as a “big bird” and the drone as a “small bird”. He emphasised: “The order is rocket, drone, rocket.”
The SBU said it recovered drones, warheads and mines from one of the arrested Ukrainian accomplices. He and other members of the alleged network face charges of treason and terrorism. The FSB promised to pay $50,000 if the “business” was successfully carried out, it was said.
The SBU chief, Vasyl Maliuk, was quoted as saying by his agency on Telegram: “The terrorist attack, which was supposed to be a gift to Putin for the inauguration, was indeed a failure of the Russian special services.” Maliuk added: “We must not forget that the enemy is strong and experienced. He cannot be underestimated.”
Moscow had no immediate comment. The Kremlin declined to say anything last month when asked about the arrest in Poland of a man accused of working with Russian intelligence to prepare another possible attempt to assassinate Zelenskiy. The president said last autumn that there have been at least five Russian plots to kill him.
One intelligence source in Kyiv said it was unclear whether top officials in Moscow had authorised the plot. They suggested it may have been the result of an operation by mid-level officers, seeking to impress their bosses. “Possibly they were acting on their own initiative,” the source said."
5912,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-10-19,"KYIV -- U.S. Undersecretary of State Uzra Zeya, during a visit to Kyiv, underscored ""unwavering U.S. solidarity"" with Ukraine against Moscow's aggression and vowed continued support for Kyiv's efforts to battle corruption at home.
""Our message, building on the visit of Administrator Power, and Secretary Blinken in recent weeks is a straightforward one: U.S. support is steadfast in the face of Russia's illegal war against Ukraine,"" she said in an interview with RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service on October 18, referring to USAID chief Samantha Power and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
Zeya, the U.S. a secretary of state for public security, democracy, and human rights, said that ""providing Ukraine with the support that it needs to prevail is a top priority for the United States.""
She said that among the key points she stressed during her meetings with leaders in Kyiv was U.S. backing to help ""Ukraine win the war, win the peace, and win the future by strengthening its democratic resilience. ""
Prior to her visit, the State Department said Zeya would emphasize ""continued partnership on anti-corruption and rule-of-law reforms, a strong civil society and independent media, and advancing victim- and survivor-centered justice and accountability for Ukrainians.""
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and other leaders have pressed Ukraine's allies for additional military aid and also permission to use Western-supplied weapons to attack bases deep inside Russia, something Washington and other countries have been reluctant to grant over fears of igniting a wider conflict.
RFE/RL's Ukraine Live Briefing gives you the latest developments on Russia's invasion, Western military aid, the plight of civilians, and territorial control maps. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.
While providing aid to Ukraine, Western partners have also pressed Kyiv to make gains against widespread corruption in the country to -- as Zeya said during the visit -- help ""secure a fully integrated Ukraine with Europe.""
""The United States is proudly supporting Ukraine's tremendous anti-corruption gains, from reforming oversight of financial crimes and increasing the number of anti-corruption judges to doubling the number of indictments and convictions in the last 16 months,"" she said.
Zeya said the United States ""will do its utmost to rally its partners to help Ukraine, hold Russia accountable for its atrocities, and advance comprehensive justice for its people.""
During her visit Zeya, announced a $5 million partnership with the Institute for War and Peace Reporting to ""enhance collaboration between civil society and Ukrainian anti-corruption institutions toward even greater government transparency and accountability.""
""I think the fact that Ukraine is consistently rising in Transparency International's annual rankings over recent years as it is repelling this brutal full-scale invasion really speaks to the tenacity, resourcefulness, and determination of Ukraine's anti-corruption efforts,"" she said.
Transparency International has ranked Ukraine 104th out of 180 countries in its most recent index.
The watchdog said in its report for 2023 that ""across the region, many governments control the judiciary and law enforcement institutions to maintain impunity for corruption for those in their privileged circles.""
For ""countries in the Western Balkans, these persistent practices stand in the way of European Union membership. This is also the case for Moldova and Ukraine, although these countries are making substantial reforms to their justice systems,"" Transparency International said.
Zeya also vowed that Washington would continue its support for ""millions of displaced Ukrainians, including those in Ukraine and around the region"" who have had their lives thrown into turmoil by the Russian invasion.
The U.S. diplomat is scheduled to travel to Poland and Britain following her visit to Ukraine."
2482,fake,INSTITUTIONAL_AND_MEDIA_DISTRUST_PUBLIC_INSTITUTIONS,2024-05-15,"Mirrored images of King Charles III’s new Royal portrait have revealed hidden images of Baphomet – a figure associated with Satanic and occult practices – worked into the artwork.
The artwork, characterized by its Satanic red color scheme and detailed depiction of Charles in his Welsh Guards uniform, was intended as a tribute to the king’s longstanding service. However, a disturbing visual phenomenon involving the mirrored image of the portrait has revealed more than can be seen at first glance.

The People’s Voice reported on Tuesday that the portrait was painted by artist Jonathan Yeo, and it depicts Charles against a background of “vivid red hues” – maybe too vivid – wearing the uniform of the Welsh Guards military unit, Charles was made Regimental Colonel of this regiment in 1975.
A young girl with a butterfly flutters just above his right shoulder to complete the disturbing effect. Butterflies are well-known symbols in occult circles.
“My aim was also to make reference to the traditions of Royal portraiture but in a way that reflects a 21st Century Monarchy and, above all else, to communicate the subject’s deep humanity,” Yeo said.
GWP report: Commenters were not kind to the artwork, basically saying ‘it looks like he is in hell’. Even the NY Post called it the ‘ghostly-looking’ Charles portrait, but people went much harder.
Some asked if it was ‘all the blood on his hands?’, or said that they ‘100% thought this was satire’, called it ‘a little creepy’, ‘slightly disturbing’, ‘like he’s bathing in blood’.
“The portrait — which will ultimately hang in Drapers’ Hall — was commissioned in 2020 to celebrate the then Prince of Wales’s 50 years as a member of The Drapers’ Company in 2022.”
The discourse took an even more bizarre turn when social media users conducted a simple yet revealing experiment: mirroring the image. The mirrored image, laid next to the original, allegedly shows a face resembling Baphomet—a figure associated with occult and satanic practices.
What’s even more terrifying is that the doubled mirror image reveals a far more sinister result.
This unexpected twist has given rise to debates and “conspiracy theories” about secret messages and sinister symbols hidden in plain sight. Some have taken this as evidence of malevolent forces at work within the highest echelons of power.
Is this mirrored revelation merely a coincidence, a carefully orchestrated artistic conspiracy, or simply a trick of the eye? What do you think?"
6027,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-06-17,"Italy is set to see temperatures of 42-44C this week.
Heatwaves across Cyprus and Greece have left multiple people dead with Türkiye battling wildfires as temperatures soared above 40C.
Parts of southern Europe have sweltered in record temperatures as warm air was blown across from North Africa and more is yet to come.
Warnings have been issued as the heat brought deadly consequences for some, with schools and tourist attractions closed.
Meteorologists say it could be a preview of the extreme weather still to come this summer.
Heatwaves in Greece turn deadly for tourists
The first heatwave of the summer in Greece saw the ancient Acropolis shut to tourists, schools closed and medics stationed across Athens. Meteorologists have said this stretch of high heat will “go down in history” and could be a sign of things to come this summer in the country.
At least five tourists, including UK TV doctor and journalist Michael Mosley, have died in Greece over the last few weeks.
A missing American tourist was found dead on the beach on a small island west of Corfu on Sunday, according to local media reports. The remains of a Dutch tourist were found on the eastern Greek island of Samos on Saturday. These are just the latest in a series of cases where visitors disappeared or fell ill after setting out on hikes in the extreme heat.
Temperatures soared above 40C in parts of the country last week with Crete reaching 44.5C and the Peloponnese peninsula 43.9C, according to the Athens National Observatory website. Athens reached 42C as health warnings were issued.
Greece’s longest-ever heatwave was recorded last year in July where high temperatures lasted 16 days. The Acropolis was also forced to close to tourists during this period of unprecedented extreme heat.
Heatwaves are getting earlier in the country according to some experts. Meteorologist Panos Giannopoulos told Greek state television channel ERT that in the 20th century, “we never had a heatwave before 19 June. We have had several in the 21st century but none before 15 June.”
The high heat has now started to ease across the country, returning to the average of around 31C to 33C for this time of year.
Italy set to bake in first heatwave of the summer
Italy is currently baking in their first big heatwave of the summer with an African anticyclone boosting temperatures up as far as a sweltering 40C.
That is 10C above seasonal averages, says Antonio Sanò, founder of the weather website ilmeteo.it.
By the end of the week, thermometres will register 39-40C in Rome, Naples and Florence, while they will reach 42-44C in inland parts of Sardinia and Sicily.
Two dead in Cyprus from heatstroke as temperatures soar
A weeklong heatwave has also baked Cyprus with health officials saying on Sunday that a second elderly person has now died from heatstroke. At least another three elderly patients are in serious condition and hospitals have been dealing with many cases of heat exhaustion, according to local media reports.
The country issued its first red alert of the season on Friday as some areas reached 45C - 10C above the average for this time of year, setting a record for the hottest June day ever. Heavy and moderate outdoor work was also halted by the Department of Labour inspection due to the heat.
Classes were cut short for young children too after criticism over a lack of cooling systems in schools.
Temperatures on the Mediterranean island exceeded 40C all week. Cyprus has also been suffering from a lack of rain with the country’s meteorological department telling local media 2024 so far has been the 10th driest in 123 years.
As a consequence, firefighters have been battling wildfires with strong winds hampering their efforts in the mountainous area southwest of the capital city Nicosia. More than 3.2 square kilometres of forest have been burnt.
Two communities in the Paphos district were evacuated last week when a wildfire threatened their homes. Aircraft from Greece and Jordan were involved in the firefighting efforts.
Türkiye hit by extreme temperatures and fires
Temperatures in Türkiye last week were around 8 to 12C higher than the season average. Maximum temperatures reached 40C and above in many cities.
In Istanbul, warnings were issued to vulnerable groups such as the elderly, sick, pregnant women and children against prolonged exposure to the sun. High humidity levels also posed a challenge to those trying to cool off.
Wildfires have also been a concern throughout the hot weather with firefighters battling to keep them under control using planes, helicopters and other machinery.
On Friday, a total of seven provinces across Türkiye were hit by forest fires, though most were under control before the end of the day.
The worst of the heat has now subsided, with temperatures hovering around 30C.
Why is it so hot in southeast Europe?
Winds blowing heat and dust into the east Mediterranean from North Africa are behind this unusually early June heatwave. An analysis by the non-profit Climate Central claims that the extreme heat was made five times more likely by climate change with at least 290 million people suffering in unusually hot conditions.
Europe is the world’s fastest-warming continent, according to analysis by the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).
These periods of extreme heat are having a major impact on health too. A joint report from the UN's World Meteorological Organization and C3S published earlier this year found that over the last 20 years, heatwave-related deaths have increased by 30 per cent in Europe.
Temperatures across the rest of this summer are unlikely to ease up either. The EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said in its seasonal forecast that temperatures across July, August and September are likely to be hotter than average.
“'The latter part of the European summer is likely to be warmer than average everywhere (with above-normal chance of exceeding the 80th percentile of climatology for seasonal means), drier than average in the south and wetter than average in the far north,' C3S said."
3838,real,HEALTH_INCLUDING_COVID_19_AND_VACCINES,2024-09-22,"Breast cancer patients who continue to smoke after having radiotherapy are at much higher risk of their treatment causing them lung cancer in the future, research has found.
Two in three of those diagnosed with early breast cancer in the UK are given radiotherapy. It is a long-established and highly effective treatment but does also have potential side-effects.
Radiotherapy cuts the risk of someone’s breast cancer recurring after treatment and also of them dying from the disease, but its dangers include a higher risk of dying from heart disease, lung cancer or oesophageal cancer.
Breast cancer is the UK’s most common cancer, with 56,400 new cases diagnosed every year, almost all of them in women. It kills 11,500 people a year – 32 every day.
The new findings show breast cancer patients who do not smoke have less than a 1% chance of radiotherapy leading directly to them developing lung cancer in the years afterwards. But for those who do smoke when they are treated and do not quit afterwards, their risk is between 2% and 6%.
The results are from research in the UK led by Carolyn Taylor, a professor of oncology at the University of Oxford, which was funded by Cancer Research UK and published in the journal Clinical Oncology.
“Radiotherapy is very good at treating cancer. In breast cancer it reduces the chance of the cancer coming back in the future,” Taylor said. “But it’s also important to consider the risks. One of the long-term risks of radiotherapy is that it can cause second cancers many years down the line. This is a rare side-effect, but it’s important to consider.”
Her study is the first of its kind carried out in the UK. “The reason radiotherapy can cause a second cancer is because when we give a dose to the breast we cannot avoid giving some radiation doses to the surrounding tissues, such as the lungs,” she said. “This radiation can damage cells in the lungs.
“Radiotherapy damages the DNA in cells. Damage to the DNA in cancer cells can kill them. This reduces the chance of the cancer coming back. But it can also damage the DNA in some normal cells and this damage to normal cells can rarely cause a cancer many years in the future.”
The conclusions of the study, which analysed 14 previous studies of doses of radiation given to thousands of women with breast cancer in the UK, should be seen as “reassuring” for most women who have radiotherapy, Taylor said. That is because most women with breast cancer who may have the treatment are non-smokers, because only 14% of women in the UK smoke. “For them their risk of lung cancer from the radiation is below 1%. So, for them, our study is good news”.
However, for long-term smokers who do not kick the habit, “their risks are higher. UK breast cancer radiotherapy would increase their risk of lung cancer by between 2% and 6%.”
Deborah Arnott, the chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health, said smokers undergoing radiotherapy “must be warned of the risks of continuing to smoke and given the support and encouragement they need to quit.
“Continuing to smoke, and this is true for any cancer treated with radiotherapy, not just breast cancer, makes the treatment itself more unpleasant and less effective, with an increased risk of a subsequent recurrence of cancer.”
Cancer Research UK recently recognised smoking as a cause of breast cancer for the first time, alongside known risks such as diet and genetics. Labour promised in its general election manifesto to make smoking cessation services available to all hospital patients to encourage more people to quit."
5654,real,UKRAINE_WAR_AND_REFUGEES,2024-09-10,"Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal on September 10 expressed hopes for a second peace summit that could dramatically increase the number of national countries from a similar gathering in Switzerland three months ago aimed at ending the current war with Russia.
RFE/RL's Ukraine Live Briefing gives you the latest developments on Russia's invasion, Western military aid, the plight of civilians, and territorial control maps. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.
At his first press conference since a government shakeup last week, Shmyhal told journalists that he hoped the next peace summit could be organized by the end of the year and attract at least 150 countries.
In one of the most public pushes for a cease-fire since the two-and-a-half-year-old defense against a full-scale Russian invasion began in early 2022, Kyiv pressed for a Swiss summit in June where 80 countries called for the territorial integrity of Ukraine to be the foundation of any eventual peace deal.
Russian officials, whom Kyiv has accused of being unprepared and unserious about possible peace talks, were not invited to that gathering.
China, which has backed Russia diplomatically since its ""no limits"" partnership with Moscow was inked in the weeks before Russian troops rolled en masse into Ukraine, declined to attend.
Before the Swiss event, Russian President Vladimir Putin issued harsh terms for a cease-fire that included the full handover of four regions Russia claimed to annex in 2022.
Russian invasion forces are said to control about one-fifth of Ukraine, including the Crimean Peninsula occupied and annexed in 2014. It has repeatedly organized internationally unrecognized elections in occupied parts of Ukraine, including last weekend.
Ukraine has claimed control of around 1,200 square kilometers of Russian territory since a surprise incursion into Russia's southern Kursk region was launched in early August.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last week that ""we don't need their land"" but that the incursion allows for potential bargaining chips in the form of captured land and troops.
Zelenskiy has repeatedly pushed back against reports of international pressure that might encourage Kyiv to give up hope of regaining control of all its territory in exchange for peace.
Russian media on September 10 quoted former Russian Defense Minister and current Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu as saying the Kursk attack was intended to distract Moscow from its goals in eastern Ukraine. But, he said, Russian forces are continuing their offensive.
At the press conference in Kyiv, Shmyhal said Ukraine significantly boosted its weapons production on the previous year and hoped to produce 1 million drones -- a critical tool to resist larger Russian forces -- by the end of the year.
""In the first eight months of 2024, we have doubled our weapons production compared to 2023. We are making progress. Drone production continues to grow,"" he was quoted as saying.
Shmyhal also touted the relative success of the Ukrainian economy in the form of 3.7 percent growth in the second quarter and modest inflation.
He claimed that Ukrainian exports were nearing prewar levels.
But Shmyhal acknowledged that talks with the monitoring mission of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were ""difficult"" and rife with challenges."

Ukraine’s largest children’s hospital was destroyed by a Russian missile on Monday, shaking Kyiv, the capital, with images of bloodied and injured children, and sending hundreds racing to the scene to help clear twisted metal and smashed concrete in a desperate search for survivors.
The hospital strike was part of a barrage of bombings by Moscow across the country, including one of its deadliest assaults on Kyiv since the first months of the war. At least 38 people were killed across the country, including 27 in Kyiv. More than 100 people were injured. The Ukrainian air force said it shot down 30 out of the 38 missiles launched by Russia during the attack, which began in the midmorning.
“The attack was massive, combined with the use of aerial, ballistic and cruise missiles,” said Serhii Popko, the head of the Kyiv military administration. “The missiles flew at the capital in waves and from different directions.”
At the hospital, one doctor and another adult were killed and at least 10 more people were injured, including seven children, local officials said. At least three children were pulled from the rubble, Ukraine’s emergency services agency said.
This is a ten on both the hypocrisy and propaganda scales. Check it for yourself. Do an internet search on the following — “Ukraine strikes Sevastopol.” Only cursory coverage. No blaring headlines in the NY Times or Financial Times or any other major paper. Ignore it. But this? Intense coverage.
Only one problem with the story — it is BULLSHIT. The children’s hospital was hit by an errant air defense missile fired by Ukraine. Whoops! What is really telling is that there was ZERO news coverage of the other sites hit by Russian missiles in Kiev. You know why? Because they were military targets and there were probably Western casualties. Russia delivered this blow in daylight during working hours in order to inflict maximum casualties on those engaged in producing or repairing weapons.
Ukrainian authorities also lied about the number of Russian missiles shot down. The Ukie Air Force claimed it downed 30 of 38 Russian missiles. Check out the following videos. You can see at least five successful Russian missile strikes in Kiev, including some secondary explosions, which normally are associated with a weapons storage facility. (We’ll see how long YouTube allows the first video to stay online. I will also post on BitChute.)
Shifting to Israel’s genocide of the Palestinians, the British medical journal The Lancet, released a stunning report on the number of Palestinians who have died or will die because of Israel’s murderous campaign:
As many as 186,000 Palestinians may be killed directly or indirectly by the Gaza war, the British medical journal, the Lancet, has predicted.
“Even if the conflict were to end immediately, many indirect deaths will continue to be recorded in the coming months and years due to causes such as reproductive, communicable and non-communicable diseases,” the journal reported.
The death toll could exceed this figure, it said, “given the intensity of this conflict; destroyed healthcare infrastructure; severe shortages of food, water and shelter; the population’s inability to flee to safe places; and the loss of funding to [the UN agency for Palestinian refugees] Unrwa, one of the very few humanitarian organisations still active in the Gaza Strip”.

If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him?” — Matthew 7:9–11
(What We Need Now) — “If it’s wrong, you’ll have to show me another way, because I just can’t see it.” At 19 years old, I whispered this prayer to God, closed my Bible, and turned my face away. Amid my experiences with lesbian relationships, I was questioning Christian teaching about same-sex sexual behavior.
Many Christian leaders – from Catholic Synod on Synodality participants to evangelical megachurch pastors – are now posing comparable questions. But are all inquiries into settled matters made in good faith? Too often, we ask because we don’t like the answer already given. Our “questions” are posed as a means to demand a different one.

I first experienced same-sex attraction during a youth group meeting in a Baptist church. I was sitting on the floor with my back against the couch. Innocently, one of our leaders, a young married woman, began playing with my waist-length hair. A rush of feelings welled up from deep within me. I was confused as my emotions surged toward her. These feelings were shocking and unbidden, yet forceful and compelling. At 12 years old, I could not have known that the conflict between my sexuality and my faith would become the deepest and most intense battle of my life.
Though the etiology of same-sex attraction (SSA) is not always clear, I connect mine to two adverse childhood experiences – a pair of deep wounds. First, I was separated from my birth family as an infant. Though my adoptive parents were kind and loving, this profound rupture left a “primal wound.” I longed for my birth mother from my earliest recollections and was drawn to any woman who showed me nurture or kindness.
Second, at age 10, I was repeatedly sexually abused by an uncle over the course of an extended summer vacation. These are the “twin tracks” laid in my early life that profoundly affected my overall development, sexual and otherwise.
When same-sex attraction began emerging two years later, I was mortified and ashamed and did my best to bury those feelings. By high school, I was confused, hurting, and thinking of suicide – a common story that has not improved over time, even as school-based and societal “welcoming” efforts surge. The wounds that had been quietly festering were now openly bleeding.
At 15, I wore a tuxedo to our school dance, sporting newly cropped hair and wishing I could take a girl as my date. With this gender-bending debut, my struggles officially erupted for all to see. The entire school concluded that I was gay. Worried that they might well be right, I made a plan to get a boyfriend and sleep with him to prove it wasn’t true. This desperate and misguided strategy ended with predictable results: awful experiences, guilt, and still more shame. I lost all hope. Consistent with data to the present day, my teenage sexual activity made me more suicidal than ever.
But in this most desperate of times, God’s love broke through. Jesus came to seek and save the lost, and by His mercies, that included me. Eleven days shy of my 16th birthday, I had a genuine conversion and wanted to follow Christ wherever He led. I had never been so happy. Jesus loved me, and He was going to change my life. I was a new creation – “old things have passed away; behold, new things have come.”
Because I was now in Christ, I thought that my same-sex attraction and my related problems would be “done away with” – those things were gone. Except, of course, they weren’t. What the Scripture actually says is that a process of becoming a new creation has begun. My attractions and wounds were still there, waiting to be dealt with. And I didn’t know how to do anything but suppress them. I certainly didn’t know how to bring them to the Lord.

In college, after years of struggling alone, I gave in. I walked away from God and straight into the arms of a woman. I came out and began building my life around my lesbian identity. I had a girlfriend, and I felt happy – indeed “there is pleasure in sin for a season.” And as with the prodigal son, my Father let me go. He did not lie to me. He did not say that I could have the joys of living in His house and the pleasures of the far country at the same time. So, I left His house, and I traveled far.
Walking away from God was a painful but conscious move – I knew the Christian teaching I was rejecting was unambiguous. Evading a conscience is difficult, though. Deep down I knew what I was doing was immoral. While I had never heard the Natural Law described, I knew instinctively that I was violating something fundamental. My body was not designed for the sexual activity I was engaging in – strong desire and pleasure notwithstanding. But I did not want to repent and steeled myself against conviction, defending my actions. I hadn’t chosen to experience such attractions; indeed, they felt “natural” to me.
Was I born this way? This was 1989, and the search for the “gay gene” was intensifying. I resorted to arguing that I was, but I did not really believe it; such was thin but easy cover. At the time, I did not know that the increased prevalence of adverse childhood experiences, especially sexual abuse, among those who experience same-sex attraction and engage in homosexual behavior, was and would continue to be well established in the research.
Psychology has always had to admit that complex interactions of genetics, environment, and experience must play a role, and impressive large-scale studies in recent years have produced definitive evidence that sexual orientation is not genetically pre-determined nor even primarily a heritable attribute. Even if such inclinations had been inborn, how would that remove my responsibility for evaluating them morally and exercising my will in light of God’s truth?
But I was enjoying myself, and I did not want to think of such things. I kept constructing my life around my lesbian identity.
During this time, I began to search for my birth mother in earnest, eventually obtaining a court order to unseal my adoption records. The night before I was to present it at the state capital, I was out at some lesbian bars with my friends. As we strolled through downtown Austin, Texas, I exuberantly and defiantly proclaimed: “I love this life, and nothing will ever make me give it up!” The next morning, a state clerk handed me my original birth certificate. My hands trembled as I opened the envelope that would reveal my mother’s name. Finally, I could find her.
For brevity’s sake, I must skip to the end. I did not receive the warm welcome that I had been dreaming of. Far from being glad to hear from me, my beautiful mother admitted that she had dreaded the day. Woefully unprepared for her rejection, the pain of it shocked me. For days, I cried from the moment I woke up until sleep overtook me at night. And after about a week of such days, I started to realize that these tears weren’t blurring my vision; they were clearing it. Like the prodigal son, I was coming to my senses.
For the first time in many months, I had a conversation with God that went something like this: “God, I don’t know how I got here. But I can’t live without you. And if there’s any way you can bring me home, bring me home.” I had to return to the Father’s house. And just as in the parable, my Father was running to meet me.

My feelings, however, remained unchanged. I did not want to leave my lesbian life, yet I knew Jesus was calling me to lay that down. I was deeply conflicted and felt at an impasse. “I am a lesbian. If I am gay, how does one repent from who they are?”
As I wrestled with this question, I providentially happened upon a television program on gay rights. Among the mainly gay-affirming messages, there was a brief portrayal of Christians who were leaving homosexuality behind to follow Christ. I was shocked. I had never heard of anyone like this. Unsurprisingly, they were being portrayed as fools. The interviewer grew impatient with one woman as she admitted her continued struggle: “Come on, all this God stuff, tell us the truth. Right now, if you could choose, who would you choose? Would you choose to be with a man or a woman?” Her reply? “I choose Jesus.”
And with those words, light streamed into my soul. I thought, “I can do that. That’s what I can do. I choose Jesus. Because I cannot say that I would choose a man. One hundred percent of me would choose a woman. But I can choose to follow Christ in obedience. My sexual feelings do not have to define me. I choose Jesus.”
Thus, I surrendered my sexuality to God and focused on following Him. In doing so, I never thought my attractions would even lessen in degree, and I fully expected to be single, celibate, and perhaps struggling with longings, for the rest of my mortal life. But I was willing to do it, because I knew who was asking: “Lord, to whom else shall we go? You have the words of life.”
In those early days, my battle with temptation truly was fierce and felt constant. I had never really struggled with lust before, but now I did. I honestly didn’t think I was going to make it, and my determination to walk a different path was a white-knuckled one. In desperation, I began meditating on Jesus and the temptations in the desert. I contemplated how, after 40 days, Jesus had legitimate hunger; however, He did not wrongly use His power to meet His needs. He refused to turn stones into bread. And it was after He resisted Satan’s offers that the ministry of the angels came. I called this to mind often as I struggled to wait on God.
My repentance was still fresh when the biggest temptation yet arrived in the mail – a card from my ex-girlfriend. Of course she would come back into my life now. “I’m being kicked while I’m down,” I told a friend, “Here I am trying to follow Christ, and this is the one woman I can’t resist.” I finished my rant by declaring, “But I’m not going to do it. I will not turn these stones into bread.”
And as I spoke those words, I closed the card. I had been so quick to open to its message, I hadn’t paid attention to the cover. There on the front was a single image – a close up picture of a pile of stones. The photo title on the back read: “Stones on a beach.” The divine message could not have been clearer: I know you are hungry. This is not bread.
My hunger was legitimate; satisfying it through a same-sex relationship was not. I was going to have to wait on God and trust Him to give me bread in His time. After all, it was Jesus who said, “What father among you, if his child asks for bread, would give him a stone?”

Stones are neither nutritive nor designed for digestion. Same-sex sexual relationships are neither unitive nor complementary and can never be fruitful. I had a sexual appetite for things that could not fulfill God’s design or intentions for my female body. Just as I was not designed to eat stones, I was not designed for same-sex relations.
God did not create me to be “gay.” Despite the tenacity of my same-sex attraction, I am not a third category of human, nor are my body and reproductive system differently ordered. In my sexuality, my Father did not say that stones would serve as bread for me. He wouldn’t bend the Natural Law for me, but He would help me live in harmony with it. God asked me to trust Him because He is good, and only within His will can I flourish and be free.
During my graduate studies, I found a faithful evangelical church and was blessed with spiritually mature mentors who prayed for me. When they found out I had been lesbian-identified and still experienced same-sex attraction, they never labeled me with a sexual identity. They never said, “Amy is gay.” How does the Good Shepherd call us? He calls us by name. They honored me by doing the same.
For more than 10 years, they held me in the bosom of their friendship and prayers. I matured as a disciple as they walked alongside me, affirming my identity in Christ, helping me up after each fall and pointing me to Jesus each step of the way. I still walk in sweet fellowship with these wonderful mentors, and they pray for me to this day.
Over the course of this decade, my attractions to women actually lessened. As I turned 30, I even began to experience an awakening towards men. But I never sought or expected this: my orientation seemed fixed to me, and the culture had led me to believe that this was a characteristic that never changed.
I later learned how much the narrative of immutability was utilized for political expedience. The major gay rights organizations had campaigned effectively to deny the possibility of change, and to create social norms against transformation. Despite their efforts, human sexuality remains fluid. The potential for change in one’s desires is real, and countless studies and testimonies demonstrate that truth.
To my surprise, I married at age 37 and was blessed with two children. However, had I remained single as I always thought I would, I would have been more than content. I chose Jesus, and indeed, He is more than enough. My joy and life’s fulfillment do not come from my sexuality or my marital state, but from my Creator and being in harmony with His will.
As I have written before, I am deeply grateful that there is concern for greater pastoral accompaniment for those struggling with their sexuality. But I am gravely concerned by those whose response to that struggle is to advocate for capitulation to sin.
In the name of welcome and inclusion, too many preach that Christian moral teaching has somehow missed the mark for millennia. The reality is that God’s commands are gifts of love, and He only forbids that which harms us. What motivates this disastrous compromise on something not only attested throughout Church teaching but also declared in the theology of the body? Perhaps the biggest factor is a false compassion and misguided (and misnamed) mercy.

For decades, those who identify as sexual minorities have been known to suffer negative mental and physical health disparities compared with heterosexuals. The scapegoat for these disparities has long been the burden of “minority stress” emanating from both society’s rejection and the Church’s disapproval.
Our compassion for those who suffer misleads us. “If only same-sex relationships were okay, then these people would be okay. If we provide enough affirmation and welcome, these people will suffer no more.” The truth is that record-high societal acceptance, legalized same-sex marriage, and a massive cultural shift of power have not alleviated these disparities, as study after study shows.
Along with decades of data from the Netherlands, the first country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage, recent population-based studies in the U.S. tell the same story: increasing societal affirmation does not eliminate the mental and physical health gaps between heterosexuals and those who identify themselves as lesbian or gay. In Australia, four waves of population-based surveys of young women in the 2010s yielded similar results. The authors expressed their dismay and surprise that despite the study being conducted at a time in which “acceptance of same-sex sexuality was relatively high,” the data showed that “the adoption of a non-heterosexual identity was still associated with a large and meaningful elevation in psychological distress.”
Over three decades, across three generations, on three different continents, there has been no measurable change. Why? Because there is a “law written on the heart,” a Natural Law, and alternative sexualities violate that law. Our bodies were not made for this; hence, we were not made for this. Technological advances can create buffers and political “progress” can offer novel rights. Neither can change the simple reality of the harmfulness and barrenness of non-heterosexual “sex.”
When confronted with this truth, too many progressives – both inside and outside the church – double down on their errors. The Australian researchers propose that alleviating distress will require “reforming heteronormative social structures” and “[d]ismantling the social structures that continue to produce these disparities” in order “to support the mental health and well-being of young women.”
But God’s created order and design is not an oppressive “social structure” made by human hands. Those who want to change Christian teaching in order to alleviate the distress of the LGBT-identified align themselves with this worldly wisdom. To do so, they have no choice but to defy God and attempt to dismantle reality itself. Thus, they are doomed to fail and will exacerbate the very suffering they claim to heal. What we need now is a compassionate response to the LGBT community that is also truthful about the human person and human sexuality.

Faithful pastors, priests, and prelates: affirmation of same-sex behaviors and false sexual identities is not accompaniment; it is abandonment. Genuine pastoral care for LGBT-identified persons is to meet them where they are, love and accept them, and accompany them to Jesus who is full of grace and truth. Remember that you offer bread in the midst of a culture that has normalized eating stones.
What man among you, if his son asks for bread, would give him a stone?
A good father will not give his child a stone. A good father gives bread. As shepherds of His flock, I beg you, do the same.

The United Nations’ unprecedented effort to reduce emissions of CO2, would be not only costly but deadly as well. The denial of efficient, affordable energy to a world in need would necessarily lead to the loss of millions of lives and the impoverishment of many millions more. This is intentional.
Let’s not lose touch…Your Government and Big Tech are actively trying to censor the information reported by The Exposé to serve their own needs. Subscribe now to make sure you receive the latest uncensored news in your inbox…
The above are remarks made in the introduction of a 64-page report published by the Executive Intelligence Review (“EIR”) in September 2019. The report is aptly named ‘CO₂ Reduction’ is a Mass Murder Policy Designed by Wall Street and the City of London’.
As the name suggests, the report details carbon dioxide (“CO2”) reduction as a mass murder policy. It discusses climate psychologists promoting CO2 reduction as a solution viewing economic development as undermining the future, and advocating for policies that may have negative consequences.
It discusses the “green finance bubble”; the push for “green finance” by the Bank of England and BlackRock that will lead to devastating societal damage if not stopped in time.
And gives the history of energy development which shows the importance of increasing energy flux-density for societal progress, contrasting with the limitations of green energy sources like wind and solar power.
Importantly, the first chapter ‘The Age of Reason is in the Stars’ emphasises the need for a positive image of mankind and passionate love for humanity to unleash the unlimited potential of humans.
As you can see from the index shown above, many aspects in this report could be highlighted and each is as important as another. We have chosen to highlight points made about the green finance bubble because the main driving forces of all these interconnected plans being rolled out across the world in recent years seem to be either ideological or financial.
Please note that the report was written in 2019 and we have not edited the tense of the text extracted from it to accommodate for this. Neither have we adjusted the text to show, for example, former governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney’s current role. And we have used the same section titles as EIR’s report for ease of reference.
How Climate Hysteria and Radical Environmentalism Are Supposed to Save the System
Greening World Finance
The global push for a transition to a “climate sustainable economy” cannot be understood unless it is put in the context of the bankrupt global financial system. The “greening of the economy” is nothing but the last effort to bail out the system with a new giant financial bubble.
Not accidentally, in a paper published on 12 September 2019, the Institute of International Finance, the cartel of the financial industry, has characterised the green economy as “the new gold.”
As EIR is drafting its report, CO2 is Mass Murder, central banks and government efforts to keep the global financial system artificially alive after the 2008 financial crisis are approaching their exhaustion. The big 2008 bailout blew out central bank balance sheets and pushed government budgets to the limit of over-indebtedness, rolling over and actually increasing the global debt bubble.
Overall, global debt had grown to $244 trillion as of the third quarter of 2018, a 100% increase from a decade ago. At the same time, austerity measures implemented by governments to make the bailouts “fiscally sustainable” have brought the real economy to a halt. A decade of liquidity injections by central banks with zero and now negative interest rates has kept inflating the bubble while failing in the purported aim of reviving the real economy.
As a result, the system is facing a liquidity crisis in the short term, which will require an even larger bailout effort than in 2008, when the Fed alone committed up to $16.8 trillion overnight to prevent a total collapse.
Nobody has the crystal ball to forecast when the collapse will occur, but warnings such as the one that occurred on September 17, when a liquidity crisis sent the interbank lending rate up to 10%, forcing the Federal Reserve into emergency liquidity actions and back toward quantitative easing programs, should be taken seriously.
The answer of the financial industry to the threatened collapse of the system is the creation of a new giant bubble financed with taxpayers’ and “helicopter” money. The new bubble is called “green finance.” It won’t work, but it will do devastating damage to society if we don’t stop it in time.

A ‘Regime Change’ For the Financial System
In leading the efforts for “greening” the financial system, both Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and Wall Street giant BlackRock LLP are promoting many other new and exotic ideas to save the current bankrupt system.
Among the proposals brought up, before and after the meeting of central bankers at the Kansas City Fed’s August 2019 Economic Policy Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, is that offered by four prominent BlackRock executives, who issued a paper proposing a new monetary policy to be applied when the next crisis hits; they called it “going direct,” meaning that central banks could print money and directly lend to governments, institutions, firms, etc. Such a policy, sometimes called “helicopter money,” is supposed to allow a return of some desired inflation without increasing public debts.
One of those executives, former Swiss National Bank Chairman Philipp Hildebrand, called the scheme a “regime change” in monetary affairs in an interview with Bloomberg on 15 August 2019:
We are going to see a regime change in monetary policy that’s as big a deal as the one we saw between pre-crisis [of 2008] and post-crisis, a blurring of fiscal and monetary activities and responsibilities.
In this “regime change,” the central banks will still be independent of the governments, but the governments won’t be independent from central banks.
BlackRock called its immediate scheme the Standby Emergency Fiscal Facility, or SEFF.
From his side, Carney, speaking at the Jackson Hole meeting, proposed that to have a world economy less hostage to the United States-China trade disputes, one should create a synthetic world currency to replace the dollar, an international new reserve digital currency he calls a “Synthetic Hegemonic Currency.” He described it as being modelled on Facebook’s proposed Libra, but issued and controlled by central banks working with but ruling over governments.
The central banks’ “regime change” could happen much more quickly than Mark Carney was letting on in his remarks about a “Libra-like” digital currency replacing the dollar.
Further resources: Bank of England Governor: Libra-Like Currency Could Replace US Dollar, Coin Telegraph, 23 August 2019
Digital Money and Green Boondoggles
As “shocking” as BlackRock’s scheme and Mark Carney’s “Libra-like” proposal are in themselves, equally striking is that both are leaders in the current “climate change finance.” The Green Finance Initiative of the central banks is spearheaded by Carney’s Bank of England (“BoE”).
BlackRock, together with the Rhodium Group, is pushing a sophisticated “Google Maps”-type programme classifying the “climate change risk” to investments in US municipal bonds, electric utilities, and commercial real estate, literally property by property. Risk, that is, from “extreme heat waves,” wildfires, floods, extreme storms, etc. Fossil fuel production facilities are all classified as “high risk” in this programme, reflecting only the virtual reality of investment advice.
BlackRock’s programme is a pilot project for the “sustainable finance classification system” the European Commission is working at, also called “Taxonomy” (see below, ‘The High-Level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance’). Once the Taxonomy system is in place, customers can be induced to invest their money into “green projects,” and a “committee of experts” can be designated by central banks to decide how to spend the money printed for government “use in creating inflation.”
On the record of their current activity, if the BoE’s Carney and BlackRock’s “experts” get their way, “green finance” is going to be the central banks’ favourite cause for printing “fiscal money for purposes of inflation” (“helicopter money”).
And no such helicopter money is more finger-tip controllable by central banks than a world digital currency issued by them.
As Lyndon LaRouche said, if London, Wall Street and the central banks stubbornly refuse to accept the necessary bankruptcy reorganisation of their system, they have no other option than to supply the rope to hang themselves.
Profiles of the Green Finance Conspirators
The December 2015 Paris COP21 conference was a watershed for Green Finance policies. Although the recommendation to build a Green Finance system was already the essence of the famous 700-page report on the “economics of climate change” commissioned in 2006 by the British government and written by London School of Economics economist Nicolas Stern, it was the Paris COP21 that for the first time, Green Finance made its way into a final document.
In that framework, the following institutions, among others, were founded:
- The Network for Greening the Financial System (“NGFS”), to convince and engage central banks and supervisors in policies to “green” world finances;
- The High-Level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance (“HLEG”) to draft EU policies;
- The Green Finance Institute (“GFI”), to make sure that the City of London maintains its hegemony over the “greened” finance system.
The common purpose of those initiatives is to promote legislation that diverts financial flows from the “CO2 economy” into a “CO2-free economy.”
Network for Greening the Financial System
The Network for Greening the Financial System (“NGFS”) was created at COP21 by eight central banks and supervisors and now has 42 members and eight observers. Its stated purpose:
To help strengthen the global response required to meet the goals of the Paris agreement and to enhance the role of the financial system to manage risks and to mobilise capital for green and low-carbon investments in the broader context of environmentally sustainable development.
What distinguishes the NGFS from the other Green Finance institutions is the “manage risks” function proper of supervisors and central banks. Being aware of the fact that a massive shift from CO2-connected assets to CO2-neutral assets can provoke a deadly shock to the financial system (the “Minsky climate moment”), the task is to price that risk and build reserves – or their equivalent.
Its mastermind appears to be Bank of England Governor Mark Carney. Its steering committee is heavily populated by Northern European institutions: Bank of England, Banque de France, Bundesbank, Nederlandsche Bank, and the Swedish FSA. The Bank al-Maghrib, Banco de México, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and the People’s Bank of China are also members of the steering committee.
Its website and administrative headquarters are hosted by the Banque de France in Paris following Carney’s full backing of Villeroy de Galhau, a former executive of BNP Paribas and currently governor of the Banque de France.
The High-Level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance
The High Level Expert Group (“HLEG”) on Sustainable Finance was created in 2016 and drafted what has become the Commission Action Plan, approved by the European Council in February 2019.
Founder of the HLEG is Christian Thimann, Chairman of the Management Board at Athora Insurance Holding Germany, and former senior AXA manager, and long-time advisor to the European Commission and the ECB.
Thimann, who teaches at the Paris School of Economics, boasts of having drafted the infamous European Union (“EU”) Fiscal Compact together with Olivier Guersant, Director General of the EU’s General Directorate on Financial Stability and Capital Markets (“FISMA”), who later founded the HLEG with Thimann and EU Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis.
In a speech at the House of Finance at Goethe University in Frankfurt on 27 July 2019, Thimann said:
If you read the [COP21] Agreement suddenly in Article 2, the financial sector is mentioned. It was an issue for ecologists, industrialists, and scientists. And suddenly in the 21st session [i.e., COP21] you have a remarkable sentence about finance. It says the following: “The climate targets will only be achieved, if we start to reorient capital flows towards a low emission world. . . .”
This is now a process that is going on, where the European Commission is asking experts from the private sector: Can you please tell us, how we would do that…? And this is the program that the commission has been working on for two years, which is now being cast into law.
Thimann went on to praise Greta Thunberg’s FridaysForFuture and Extinction Rebellion (“XR”) movement.
In a 13 March 2019 article, Thimann recounted the “inside story” of how the HLEG came to life and how it drafted the EU Action Plan. In only three years of work, the HLEG has lobbied all EU institutions, committees and subcommittees, held a consultation with financial institutions and issued a final report in January 2018.

Green Finance Initiative
The Green Finance Initiative (“GFI”) was created in London in 2018 to make sure that the City of London remains in control of the “greened” financial system. On its web page, GFI states:
The City of London Corporation – the body responsible for running London’s Square Mile – regards green finance as prudent, profitable and one of the best tools available in the race to cut carbon. That’s why, in January 2016, we launched our Green Finance Initiative in partnership with government.
Further reading: Time for the City to act on climate change is now, Green Finance Initiative, 2 July 2019
The GFI’s chairman is Sir Roger Gifford, a British banker whose connections to Sweden raise questions about the network that controls Fridays4Future’s Greta Thunberg.
Gifford is the UK head of branch of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the Swedish SEB bank, which does some financing for IKEA, whose Daniela Rogosic, their global PR director, is on the Advisory Board of Greta promoter Ingmar Rentzhog’s “We Don’t Have Time” platform. Gifford is also head of the British-Swedish Chamber of Commerce.
The GFI was publicly launched during the Climate Action Week in July 2018 in London. Presenting the new institute – initially funded by the UK Treasury and the City – former Barclays banker and GFI CEO Rhian-Mari Thomas explained that the GFI mission was for the financial “industry” to “produce” new securities and derivative “instruments” to draw liquidity issued by central banks.
Further reading: Dr. Rhian-Mari Thomas Introduces the Green Finance Institute, Green Finance Institute, 3 July 2019
The launch of the GFI during the Climate Action Week shows how the financial institutions, the media, the corrupt political elite and the XR battering ram act in a coordinated way to achieve their aims.
One month earlier, the XR movement had scored its first success in the United Kingdom, where the House of Commons adopted its demand of declaring a Climate Emergency on 1 May. The motion for a Climate Emergency was introduced by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.
The Sustainable Finance Working Group
The Sustainable Finance Working Group (“SFWG”) is the “private counterpart” to the work of the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System. Established in 2018 by the International Finance (IIF), the global association of financial institutions, the IIF has co-authored all decisions to bail out and “reform” the financial system since 2008, including the introduction of the infamous “bail-in” procedures. One could actually say that the financial industry represented by the IIF and the system of central banks is one and the same thing, as proven by their officials going through revolving doors in both directions.
The IIF Sustainable Finance Working Group is chaired by Daniel Klier, Group Head of Strategy and Global Head of Sustainable Finance for HSBC (formerly the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp.) The SFWG has four subgroups, which cover a range of themes including: Engagement with Regulators and Policymakers; Disclosure and Data; Taxonomy and Impact Investment; and, Climate Economics.
The SFWG boasts:
IIF member firms around the world have been launching a wealth of new products, investment vehicles and programs to help bring sustainability considerations into the mainstream of global finance. Our job is to help connect these initiatives and align forces with public sector efforts to reach the same vitally important goals.
In a letter to the European Commission dated 25 March 2019, the IIF recommends that the Taxonomy scheme being worked out at the Commission leaves no option to companies but to engage in the green economy. The perspective it gives for manufacturing companies and farms is: either you go green or you die.
The letter is signed by Sonja Gibbs, IIF Managing Director and Head of Sustainable Finance and Global Special Report Policy Initiatives. Gibbs is co-author of a report dated 12 September 2019, with a self-betraying title: ‘Sustainable Finance in Focus: Green Is the New Gold’. The authors gloat about the growth of the green bubble, which “came close to $235 billion in the first eight months of 2019,” and is expected to reach $350 billion in 2019.
Green New Deal
Since 2006, massive programs to build solar and wind farms and new electric grids to link them, have always been accompanied with proposed heavy new taxes, sometimes on “the wealthy,” but always on “carbon”—that is, coal and oil production, blast furnace steel production, gasoline and internal combustion engines, etc.
This began with the “Global Green Party,” including the US Green Party, in 2006, inspired by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (“IPCC”); then the British “Green New Deal Group” in 2008; and most influentially, the United Nations Environmental Pro[1]gramme’s Green New Deal proposal that same year.
In the United States, this idea of a heavy carbon tax for “green” spending is being pushed by the senior figures of the Wall Street establishment: George Shultz, James Baker III, and Michael Bloomberg.
The “Baker-Shultz carbon tax” of $40/ton rising to $65/ton is being promoted personally by these figures into Congress and the financial and business community, avoiding demonstrations and publicity. Acting in parallel is the biggest and most powerful investment fund on Wall Street, BlackRock.
The basis of the Green New Deal has always been the same since 2006:
- shut down electricity production by coal, oil, nuclear power, and to a great extent by hydroelectric power;
- replace it all, somehow, by solar and wind farms and geothermal energy schemes;
- build new electricity grids to transfer this power from the desert, mountain, and rural plains areas where it will be generated.
Advocates of such a scheme must deal with the uncomfortable fact that the intermittent power sources they propose must be backed up by “spinning reserve power” produced with natural gas – a “fossil fuel” – all the while promising that breakthroughs in “energy storage”- huge batteries – will, someday, replace the natural gas turbines. They do not hide the fact that they plan to spend immense funds carrying out their scheme.

5603,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-06-15,"Environment ministers are to hold a public debate on the stalled Nature Restoration Law, in what EU environment commissioner Virginijus Sinkevičius warns in an exclusive interview could be the last chance to unblock the central EU Green Deal file before a key UN biodiversity summit in the autumn.
Belgium has scheduled what is set to be a heated public debate on a blocked Nature Restoration Law at a summit of environment ministers on Monday (17 June) after failing to break a deadlock during back-room diplomatic talks this week.
The European Parliament has already adopted the legislation, which would require environmental restoration work to begin on a fifth of land and sea by 2030 and sets long-term targets for returning specific ecosystems to health, following an informal agreement last November with the EU Council of Ministers.
However, what was supposed to be a final rubber stamp from the legislative body that represents national governments in Brussels has been blocked by a handful of countries who have reneged on the so-called ‘trilogue’ agreement.
As current holder of the rotating EU Council presidency, Belgium – in the awkward position of itself having to abstain due to opposition from the Dutch-speaking Flemish region – had hoped to win a change of heart from at least one of the countries that make up a narrow blocking minority.
Austria, Belgium, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden and, after a controversial last-minute U-turn, Hungary, have all signalled they intend to either abstain or oppose the law if it is put to the vote – in practical terms, there is no difference. If any one of them were to join the yes camp, the law would pass.
A government source revealed on Friday (14 June) that Belgium’s efforts had come to nothing, and so the presidency had put another live debate on the agenda of Monday's Environment Council summit in Luxembourg - to be followed, if there is any sign of a breakthrough, immediately by a vote that could be the last for many months, with Hungary taking over the six-month presidency in July.
The last such debate saw heated exchanges in March, with Irish environment minister Eamon Ryan warning that a rejection of the law would mean “the European system is not working” and amount to a declaration that the 27-member bloc does not take the environmental and climate crises seriously.
Environment commissioner Virginijus Sinkevičius said at the time that rejecting a law already agreed in a process used for hammering out the bulk of EU regulations and directives would raise “serious questions about the consistency and stability” of the legislative process in Brussels.
In an interview with Euronews on Friday as he prepares to leave his post and join the ranks of the Greens after being elected as an MEP for his native Lithuania, Sinkevičius warned that if the nature law is not adopted on Monday it could lead to a stalemate in Brussels ahead of the sixteenth conference of parties (COP16) to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity in October.
The last such summit, in December 2022 saw a groundbreaking agreement to reverse global biodiversity loss. “At the COP15, Europe was a leading force behind the agreement that was achieved,” Sinkevicius said. “And, of course, it wouldn't be great if we were unable to deliver on our international commitment.”
Several countries issued statements this week, setting out their positions on the NRL ahead of the first major discussion of EU environment policy since EU elections that saw the Greens lose ground across much of the bloc.
Germany, although it has signalled it would back the law, said it was “crucial” that no “additional burdens” be placed on farmers when implementing the regulation - echoing a central concern of the countries blocking the law. Another supporter, Latvia, likewise expressed “serious concerns” over measures aimed at agricultural land, notably the re-wetting of drained peatland.
The Netherlands, home to the bulk of Europe’s drained peatland, reiterated its position that its opposition to the law was in line with a resolution backed by the “vast majority” of its parliament. Poland, which plans to abstain, was opposed to the law chiefly because of a “failure to guarantee adequate financial resources for nature restoration”.
Diplomatic sources from countries in favour of the law told Euronews they still saw a chance it would be adopted on Monday. ""We don't know what will happen over the weekend, and we could suddently have a qualified majority,"" said one. Another said it was ""absolutely possible that some countries against it may come to an agreement"".
Euronews' exclusive interview with environment commissioner Sinkevičius will be published in full on Monday, 17 June."
5940,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-11-01,"New analysis emphasises the need for ambitious emissions cuts from countries.
Half of the largest cities on the planet will be at risk of one or more climate hazards by 2050, according to the latest report from the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG).
Floods, heatwaves, cyclones and water stress will increasingly pummel these populous hubs unless greenhouse gas emissions are brought under control.
LSEG’s ‘Net Zero Atlas’ report sets out what level of emissions cuts countries should be targeting to avoid such climate catastrophes, ahead of the next round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) due early next year.
“The cities in our study - nerve centres of the world economy that contribute almost 20 per cent of global GDP and are home to 440 million people - are particularly exposed to climate risk,” says LSEG’s global head of sustainable investment research, Jaakko Kooroshy.
“Impacts are already beginning to materialise at only 1.3°C of warming.”
Those climate impacts were felt on a shocking scale in the Spanish city of Valencia this week, where a year’s worth of rain fell in eight hours on Tuesday - causing deadly floods that have claimed more than 200 lives.
Major European cities will face increasing climate hazards
LSEG predicts that global heating will reach 2.6°C under current policies. The UN Environment Programme puts it at 2.6°C to 2.8°C by the end of the century if current commitments are met.
Under this high emission scenario, the share of the world’s 49 largest cities with high-risk exposure would increase from less than one in five (18 per cent) to almost one in two (47 per cent).
Major cities in the Middle East and Southeast Asia will suffer the brunt of this crisis, according to LSEG’s report. Six cities in these regions - Singapore, Surabaya, Dubai, Riyadh, Jeddah and Jakarta - are expected to experience more than 50 days of extreme heat a year by 2050.
In the EU, the analysts highlight the increasingly precarious position of Amsterdam and Madrid.
The low-lying Dutch capital faces high-level risk from sea level rise and flooding, which could increase by 60 per cent, despite its defences.
In Madrid, heatwave days could soar by 135 per cent to a ‘medium-risk’ number of 41 days by 2050. Water stress in the Spanish capital is further projected to rise by 65 per cent, becoming high-risk in 2050.
When it comes to emissions cuts, the EU is not doing enough to protect its cities. LSEG estimates that the bloc will surpass its 1.5°C aligned emissions budget by 2035.
Capitalising on Europe’s wind power potential is identified as a strong way to improve its energy outlook.
Meanwhile, London and Manchester are in the spotlight in the UK. The capital is currently deemed low-risk for major physical hazards, but is set to experience a 22 per cent rise in water stress by mid-century. London’s extreme heat will more than double from 11 to 25 days each year.
Remaining low-risk overall, Manchester will nonetheless experience climate change with a 93 per cent increase in heatwaves and a 45 per cent rise in water stress, according to the study.
How can major cities increase their climate resilience?
“As we approach COP29, G20 countries need to urgently reduce emissions to prevent climate hazards from rapidly escalating,” says Kooroshy.
“The next wave of national climate commitments will be critical for this. Nonetheless, even if the worst impacts of climate change can be prevented, significant investment will be required to adapt cities to new climate extremes.”
LSEG has outlined a range of adaptation strategies that cities can deploy, from life-saving early-warning systems and fortifications to ‘nature-based solutions’.
For example, structures such as sea walls, flood barriers, and drainage systems can cushion storm surges, allowing cities such as Amsterdam to thrive for centuries despite its extreme flood risk.
Similarly, cities are increasingly realising the value of green infrastructure in green parks, green corridors, and wetlands as these help manage floods and reduce the urban heat island effect. The LSEG report points to successful experiments, including creating a ‘sponge city’ in Shanghai, and ‘cool islands’ in Paris."

Snopes previously fact-checked this meme in 2021.
We determined that the map originated as a thought experiment created by an architect after he visited the Mediterranean. Because the map was really not created by scientists, nor for the purpose of warning the public about the effects of unmitigated climate change, we've rated this claim ""False.""
A reverse image search revealed a post on Pinterest that also featured the map, in this case crediting it to Bret Drager and titled, ""The Mediterranean Sea of America.""
Snopes conducted a Google keyword search and found that it was first posted on Feb. 4, 2014, to a blog on the architectural website Drager Architecture. A description that accompanied the map read, in part:
I had the pleasure of taking a cruise around the Mediterranean a few years ago. My wife and I had such a great time exploring the historical places and artifacts and the life of strange cities. I thought, wouldn't it be great if the Mediterranean wasn't so far away?
Well, I was examining maps and globes and realized that the Mediterranean Sea is at the same Latitude as the United States. If only it were possible to rotate the Mediterranean Sea around to our side of the planet? Would it fit? What effect would this have? What about the states… new coastlines in the middle of the country… new relationships… states torn in pieces?
A couple of screen captures, lots of graphic manipulation and now we know. The Mediterranean Sea fits within the confines of the United States of America. In a way, it is pretty amazing how big the Mediterranean Sea is. We always think if the United States as a vast country, more than 3000 miles from east coast to west coast. It used to be quite a task to traverse that distance. Amazingly, ancient mariners of the Mediterranean traversed similar vast areas of water for their commerce, and conquests.
So, what have we done? This is a new vision of the United States of America. A few states have been unaffected by this mash-up. Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Louisiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Main and Florida. Yes, I am ignoring Alaska and Hawaii since they are remote, sorry.

6067,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-09-03,"July 22, 2024 was the hottest day in recorded human history, with a global average temperature of 17.16 C.
This followed the hottest June ever recorded, which followed the hottest May ever recorded. This all follows 2023, which was the hottest year on record at 1.48 C warmer than the 1850-1900 average according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service.
As a climate scientist, I am morbidly riveted by these events, checking climate data hubs with the same fervour and frequency that my friends and family check the hockey and football scores. However, when talking to those friends and family about these climate records, I often find that three big questions often arise: what do these numbers mean, how warm will it get and what is the point of no return?
Let’s grapple with those questions and put these recent climate records into perspective.
What does 17.16 C mean for me?
It can be difficult to connect 17.16 C for the global daily average temperature to the weather in individual towns and cities. In fact, 17.16 C seems like a pleasant temperature.
Similarly, 1.48 C of total warming doesn’t sound like much. So although these numbers are useful global benchmarks for scientists and policymakers, most Canadians will likely only feel the effects of climate change through specific (usually extreme) weather events.
Read more: Attributing Canada's June heat wave to climate change is an important step in adapting to a warmer world
For example, global warming means more sweltering heat waves that make Canadians sweaty, tired and — in some cases — in need of medical care.
Consider the city of Montréal. Between 1900-1923, Montréal averaged six days per year with temperatures over 30 C. Since the year 2000 (2000-2023), the average number of days per year reaching 30 C has been more than double at 13.
Any individual hot day may still just be a hot day — it’s weather. But twice as many hot days over 24 years compared to a century ago? That’s climate change.
Will we exceed 1.5 C or 2 C?
The second question I am often asked is how close are we to passing the 1.5 C warming threshold established by the 2015 Paris Agreement? Is a breaching of this threshold imminent, how will we know if it has occurred and what does it mean to do so?
In short, a breach of the 1.5 C threshold is not imminent, though time is running out quickly.
The Copernicus Climate Change Service has a relatively high calculation for global warming. They reported 2023 as 1.48 C warmer than 1850-1900, but NASA reported a lower figure of 1.4 C.
Additionally, because our climate system has substantial variation from year to year (for example, El Niño years tend to be warmer than La Niña years), one year being above 1.5 C is not the same as the average year being above 1.5 C.
A more accurate reflection of 2023’s climate is that the 10-year average 2014-23 was about 1.19 C warmer than 1850-1900, and the El Niño conditions increased the warming to 1.43 C. With that said, the climate surpassing 1.5 C might happen within a decade, and it is very difficult to prevent. Warming also will not stop at 1.5 C.
A November 2023 evaluation of progress on curbing carbon emissions concluded that current government pledges to reduce emissions have put the world on pace for 2.5-2.9 C warming by the end of the century. There has been much progress toward stemming the rise of carbon emissions, but they need to be cut by 28 per cent more to put us on pace to stay below 2 C.
If we surpass 1.5 C, should we give up?
It can be distressing to think about what will happen if we pass 1.5 C. However, 1.5 C will not make the world uninhabitable. Many global warming impacts, from more extreme heat waves to heavier rain events to the loss of sea ice and snow cover, are reversible.
Although a breach of the 1.5 C threshold will more than likely happen, we absolutely can get back below with more aggressive action reducing emissions. Also, each additional degree of warming leads to greater change than the last, so even if we fail to stay below 1.5 C, it is still worth working toward the Paris Agreement goals to limit warming as much as possible.
That said, some impacts cannot be reversed in a human lifetime, such as the mass die-off of tropical coral reefs that are already underway.
Another major tipping element is the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, the most vulnerable of the world’s land-ice masses. If pushed into an unstable state, this ice sheet will experience a gradual but inevitable retreat over the next several centuries, leading to about three metres of sea-level rise (in addition to other sources).
Sea-level rise has already caused climate migration from several low-lying islands and coastal areas. Coastal flooding from the loss of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (plus some melt from Greenland, East Antarctica, and mountain glaciers) would force adaptation or migration for hundreds of millions of people.
How much warming is required to destabilize West Antarctica? Calculations range from 1 C to 3 C of warming, with most between 1.5 C to 2 C. In other words, there is a chance the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is already past its tipping point, but if not, any actions taken today to limit global warming may preserve it and our planet as a whole — and spare us all unnecessary harm and hardship in the process."

RFE/RL's Ukraine Live Briefing gives you the latest developments on Russia's invasion, Western military aid, the plight of civilians, and territorial control maps. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.
Zelenskiy said on Telegram on October 28 that while in Iceland he will take part in the fourth Ukraine-Northern Europe summit and hold bilateral negotiations with the prime ministers of Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Sweden. He also plans to meet with the president and representatives of Iceland’s parliament.
""Our discussions will focus on support for the Victory Plan and the areas where our cooperation can yield maximum results: financing Ukrainian weapons production and long-range capabilities, preparations for winter, maritime security, restrictions on the Russian shadow fleet, defense support, training and equipping of Ukrainian soldiers,"" Zelenskiy said.
Iceland's parliament in April adopted a resolution on support for Ukraine through 2028, including Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty, and the security of the civilian population, humanitarian aid, and reconstruction. Iceland also allocated almost 2 million euros ($2.1 million) to a Czech initiative to purchase artillery shells for Ukraine.
Separately on October 28, Britain added new sanctions on three Russian public relations agencies and their senior staff, accusing them of ""attempting to undermine and destabilize Ukraine and its democracy.""
The new sanctions target Russia's state-funded Social Design Agency (SDA), its partner company Structura, and a third company, Ano Dialog. The sanctions include three senior managers at each company.
The three firms and their leadership were responsible for a ""vast malign online network, also commonly known as Doppelganger,"" which floods social media with fake posts, counterfeit documents, and other material.
SDA and Structura had attempted ""interference operations"" aimed at Ukraine, while SDA had tried ""to incite protests in half a dozen European countries,"" the U.K. government said.
British Foreign Secretary David Lammy accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of ""resorting to clumsy, ineffective efforts to try and stoke unrest"" to destabilize Ukraine.
""Today's sanctions send a clear message: We will not tolerate your lies and interference, and we are coming after you,"" he said in a statement. ""Putin's desperate attempts to divide us will fail. We will constrain the Kremlin, and stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes."
2842,real,CLIMATE_CHANGE_AND_THE_ENERGY_CRISIS,2024-07-30,"Air NZ becomes first big carrier to drop climate goal
Air New Zealand has abandoned a 2030 goal to cut its carbon emissions, blaming difficulties securing more efficient planes and sustainable jet fuel.
The move makes it the first major carrier to back away from such a climate target.
The airline added it is working on a new short-term target and it remains committed to an industry-wide goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050.
The aviation industry is estimated to produce around 2% of global carbon dioxide emissions, which airlines have been trying to reduce with measures including replacing older aircraft and using fuel from renewable sources.
""In recent months, and more so in the last few weeks, it has also become apparent that potential delays to our fleet renewal plan pose an additional risk to the target's achievability,"" Air New Zealand Chief Executive Officer, Greg Foran, said in the statement.
In 2022, Air New Zealand adopted a 2030 target to cut its emissions by almost 29%.
It was much more ambitious than a 5% reduction goal over the same period set by the global aviation industry.
Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) are a key part of the sector's strategy to cut emissions but airlines have struggled to purchase enough of it.
""The price of [SAF] is more expensive than traditional fuels, and there is not enough capacity to produce that at scale,"" said Ellis Taylor from aviation analytics firm Cirium.
International airlines body IATA said the industry’s emissions reduction target was ""net zero 2050 and airlines are not cutting back on the pledge"".
It added that while this target was achievable, ""we are also reliant on the right supportive measures from governments"".
""We need scale up of all solutions including SAF production as well as emerging technological solutions including the use of hydrogen and carbon removals.""
Mr Taylor said that airlines were also being affected by delays to new aircraft deliveries, ""with both Boeing and Airbus under-delivering new jets over the last few years, largely due to snags in the wider supply chains of the manufacturers"".
Aerospace giant Boeing has faced a number of major issues in recent years.
This month, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge after the US found the company violated a deal meant to reform it after two fatal crashes by its 737 Max planes that killed 346 passengers and crew.
The firm has also come under increased scrutiny after a door panel in a Boeing plane operated by Alaska Airlines blew out soon after take-off and forced the jet to land."
