In an interview with Sky News on Wednesday, Dearlove, who led the UK’s Secret Intelligence Service from 1999 to 2004, during teh invasion of Iraq, claimed that Moscow has already carried out aggressive actions on NATO soil, without providing evidence. “Donald Tusk has referred to it as a pre-war situation. I think he’s wrong. I think it’s an actual war,” he said. Dearlove pointed to alleged acts of sabotage and hybrid warfare, saying, “We’ve seen already quite clearly some very aggressive moves on the part of the Russians in various European countries.” He added that intelligence agencies, including the CIA and MI6, have reportedly highlighted supposed Russian hostile actions, including sabotage. “We have to face up to the fact that the Russians think they’re in a state of war with us,” he said, again failing to back up his assertion up with proof. The comments come as the Russia-Ukraine conflict nears its third year, continuing to destabilize Europe. On Wednesday, Moscow launched another large-scale attack against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Explosions were reported in major Ukrainian cities, including Kiev and Kharkov. Despite the heightened tensions, Dearlove emphasized the importance of maintaining communication with Russia. “I’ve always believed in having a dialogue with one’s opponents or enemies,” he said. However, he believes that meaningful dialogue with Moscow may be challenging, stating, “Things could go badly wrong very quickly,” and suggesting that engaging with Russian President Vladimir Putin may not be feasible at this time. Dearlove’s remarks highlight the growing divide within Western Europe regarding the assessment of the conflict. While some NATO countries view the situation as a dangerous escalation, others, like Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico, have taken a more conciliatory approach. Fico announced his plans to visit Moscow next May for World War Two “Victory Day” celebrations.",DISINFORMATION

In recent days, northern Syria has witnessed intense fighting, marking the most violent clashes since March 2020, when a ceasefire was brokered with the involvement of Russia and Türkiye. On the morning of November 27, anti-government groups launched an offensive in the Aleppo and Idlib provinces. According to reports, the operation involves Islamist factions, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a group banned in Russia, as well as armed opposition forces such as the US and Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army. By the morning of November 28, opposition forces declared the capture of about a dozen settlements, including strategically significant areas such as Urm al-Sughra, Anjara, and Al-Houta, located west of Aleppo. Additionally, they claimed to have seized the 46th Brigade Base, the largest military base of the Syrian army. Rebel sources reported capturing five tanks, an infantry fighting vehicle, and a stockpile of missiles. On the same day, insurgents conducted a precision strike on a helicopter at the An-Nayrab airbase. Reports from Anadolu and CNN indicated that key positions, including Kafr Basma, Urum al-Kubra, and several strategic highlands, fell under rebel control. On November 28, the group Al-Fateh al-Mubin announced the capture of Khan al-Assal, located just 7 kilometers from Aleppo, along with ten tanks. The rebels claimed that panic and declining morale were spreading among President Bashar Assad’s forces. Meanwhile, the offensive also advanced south and east of Idlib, a rebel stronghold since 2015. The rebels reported taking Dadikh and Kafr Batikh, near the vital M5 highway. Over the course of three days, militants reportedly captured at least 70 settlements, spanning approximately 400 square kilometers across both provinces. By the evening of November 29, some participants in the operation even declared the capture of Aleppo, Syria’s second-largest city. They stated their mission was to “liberate the city from the cruelty and corruption of the criminal regime,” aiming to restore dignity and justice to its people. Al-Fateh al-Mubin launched a Telegram channel to document the operation, named “Deterring Aggression.” The channel has been cited by leading international and regional media outlets. According to the militants, their offensive was a response to alleged intensified airstrikes by Russian and Syrian forces on civilian areas in southern Idlib, as well as anticipation of potential Syrian army attacks. Why has the conflict gained new momentum? Before the current crisis, the Idlib province had remained the last major stronghold of armed opposition to Assad’s government throughout the Syrian conflict. The region became a focal point of overlapping interests among various local and international powers, creating a volatile and tense environment. In 2017, as part of the Astana peace process, Russia, Türkiye, and Iran agreed to establish de-escalation zones, with Idlib designated as one of them. The purpose of these agreements was to reduce the intensity of hostilities and create conditions for a political resolution. However, the ceasefire was repeatedly violated, and military operations persisted, escalating the conflict. The growing influence of radical Islamist groups, such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), complicated dialogue between the parties, as many of these organizations were excluded from negotiations and classified as terrorist groups. Türkiye, driven by strategic interests and concerns over a new wave of refugees, increased its military presence in Idlib. It supported certain opposition forces and established a network of observation posts, occasionally leading to direct confrontations with the Syrian army and straining relations with Russia. This added another layer of complexity to an already fraught situation, fueling further clashes. The humanitarian situation in Idlib continued to deteriorate. Ongoing hostilities triggered a large-scale humanitarian crisis, displacing millions of people, many of whom became refugees in neighboring countries or were displaced internally. A lack of adequate humanitarian aid and worsening living conditions heightened tensions and eroded trust in authorities. This created fertile ground for radicalization, driving recruitment into armed groups. Idlib’s strategic significance was also a key factor. The province’s location at the intersection of critical transport routes and its border with Türkiye gave it both military and economic importance. Control over this territory became a priority for all parties involved, intensifying the struggle and hindering progress toward a peaceful resolution. The radicalization of the opposition and the presence of extremist elements within its ranks further complicated prospects for peace. These groups had little interest in negotiations and sought to prolong armed conflict, undermining international efforts to stabilize the region. Simultaneously, internal challenges facing the Syrian government, such as economic difficulties, international sanctions, and domestic divisions, weakened its position. This likely prompted the government to pursue more aggressive military action to consolidate control and project strength. Thus, the current escalation in Idlib stems from a complex interplay of geopolitical interests, internal divisions, opposition radicalization, and severe humanitarian issues. Resolving the crisis requires coordinated international efforts, including active dialogue involving all stakeholders, humanitarian initiatives to alleviate civilian suffering, and a political settlement that considers the interests of various groups and promotes sustainable peace. Without a willingness to compromise and collaborate, the conflict in Idlib risks further escalation, posing a threat to regional stability and international security. Who is behind the escalation? While many speculated that Türkiye could be a beneficiary of the recent escalation – seeking to pressure Assad into normalizing relations between Ankara and Damascus –Türkiye’s official stance remained ambiguous. Statements and comments from Turkish authorities were contradictory: on the one hand, Ankara appeared to provide undeniable support to Assad’s opponents; on the other, it seemed reluctant to take responsibility for the unfolding events and expressed clear frustration with the actions of the Idlib-based “opposition.” Türkiye faced a critical decision: either continue to support the outdated status quo, potentially harming both itself and the region, or, in line with its public declarations of a desire to restore ties with Damascus and its commitments under the Astana process, assist its partners – Russia and Iran – as well as neighboring Syria in resolving the situation in Idlib. There are also suggestions that the current escalation could have been orchestrated by external actors such as Israel and the US. The flare-up began shortly after a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah and a week following reports of Western long-range missiles being used in strikes deep within Russian territory, along with Russia’s retaliatory test of the Oreshnik missile system. It is possible that the US and Israel, leveraging the situation in Ukraine, tensions with Iran, and Ankara’s anti-Israel stance and refusal to join anti-Russian sanctions, instigated unrest in Syria to achieve several objectives. One such objective might have been to deny Iran and its allies in the Levant a respite, opening a new “front” against Tehran and sowing discord between Tehran and Ankara. Additionally, it could have been aimed at increasing the strain on Russia’s Aerospace Forces supporting Damascus, thereby diverting Russian resources amid its involvement in Ukraine. The West may have sought to further weaken Russia’s position, possibly hoping to open a “second front” against Moscow with the expectation of achieving gains in Syria. For Damascus, the escalation might have served as a pressure tactic to dissuade its support for Hezbollah and its involvement in the anti-Israel front. It may also have aimed to prevent normalization with Türkiye and the formation of a unified anti-Kurdish (and thus anti-American) coalition involving Moscow, Tehran, Ankara, and Damascus east of the Euphrates. As for Türkiye, the situation could have been used to exert pressure by threatening a new wave of refugees, heightened security instability, and worsening economic conditions. This would complicate Ankara’s operations against Kurdish forces in Syria, hinder normalization with Damascus, and strain its relations with Russia and Iran. Thus, it is plausible that the current escalation in Idlib was initiated by Israel and the US, aiming to further weaken Iran and create rifts in Russia-Türkiye relations. This underscores the multilayered nature of the Syrian conflict, where external actors exploit regional tensions to advance their strategic interests. The situation highlights the need for clear political positions and coordinated actions by regional powers to address Syria’s challenges and ensure stability in the region. The war in Idlib: A harbinger of potential global catastrophe The escalation in Syria’s Idlib province transcends the bounds of a localized conflict, serving as a stark warning of global instability. The northwest of the country has become a battlefield where the interests of global powers converge, and the intensifying violence reflects the deep fractures in the current world order. The involvement of numerous external players pursuing their own agendas has turned the region into a microcosm of geopolitical contradictions, potentially foreshadowing a broader global crisis. The resurgence of long-standing conflicts, such as Israel’s military actions in Gaza and Lebanon, amplifies tensions on the international stage. These seemingly dormant or controlled confrontations are reigniting with renewed intensity, posing threats to regional and global stability. The revival of these underscores the inability of existing mechanisms to effectively prevent escalation and address the underlying causes of discord. Global tensions are nearing a critical tipping point, as many “frozen” conflicts begin to “bleed.” The old world order, built on principles and institutions shaped during the last century, is proving inadequate to meet the challenges of globalization, technological progress, and shifting power dynamics. International organizations and agreements frequently falter in the face of contemporary threats, whether terrorism, cybersecurity, or hybrid warfare. Constructing a new world order requires a rethinking of existing structures and, perhaps, dismantling outdated approaches. This transition is inherently fraught with conflict, as the shift from the old to the new is rarely smooth. Competing powers and blocs are striving to safeguard their interests, heightening the risk of confrontation unless a common understanding and mutual trust can be established. The situation in Idlib epitomizes this painful transitional phase. It highlights how regional conflicts can escalate into global crises if left unresolved. The interplay of external forces in Syria mirrors broader trends of rivalry and mistrust among major powers, further increasing the likelihood of a large-scale conflict. In conclusion, the escalation in Idlib and other global hotspots serves as a warning that the world is on the brink of profound change. To avoid sliding into a global conflict, the international community must work collaboratively to establish a new, more resilient world order capable of addressing modern challenges. This requires dialogue, compromise, and a willingness to overcome old divisions for the sake of a shared future.",DISINFORMATION

In an interview with Argumenty I Fakty newspaper on Monday, Lavrov reiterated that the “de-Nazification” of Ukraine remains one of the key goals of Russia’s military operation. “The biggest disgrace for the EU leaders – European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, [former NATO Secretary General] Jens Stoltenberg, the president of the European Council, Charles Michel – is that they have repeatedly stated from Brussels that they must support Ukraine to the end because it is fighting for their European values,” he said. This backing basically means that top Western officials “are still ready to defend the so-called values of Nazism,” the foreign minister stressed. He stated that in Ukraine, “along with laws that ban everything Russian on the basis of racism – language, education, culture, the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC)… legislation is being adopted that legitimizes the theory and practices of Nazism.” “Thugs with Nazi German chevrons march in torchlight processions [in Ukraine]. This cannot be tolerated in modern Europe,” Lavrov said. Ukrainian nationalist icon Stepan Bandera and Nazi German dictator Adolf Hitler are “one and the same,” he added. Bandera collaborated with the Nazis during World War II and is now revered as a hero by authorities in Kiev. There is a reason why a number of European countries, including Poland, have been trying to attract attention to this issue – Moscow and Warsaw have numerous differences, but in this case, the Polish authorities “objectively, stand for historical truth, so that, firstly, it is not trampled upon, and secondly, so that the Nazi movement, which is now raising its head, does not come back,” Lavrov said. In September, Polish President Andrzej Duda said that Ukraine has “problems” with its history that include not just the Volyn Massacre – the mass killing of ethnic Poles by Ukrainian nationalists during World War II – but “also service in SS units, collaboration with the authorities of the Third Reich, and participation in the Holocaust.” Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico insisted last month that “the international community should recognize that troops using Nazi insignia, who often appear to act as such, cannot fight in Ukraine.”",DISINFORMATION

Last week, the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) claimed to have thwarted an “attempt by the Ukrainian special services to commit a terrorist act in Zaporozhye Region using an analog of the BZ chemical warfare agent, according to the NATO classification” in which one man was arrested. Officials released a video clip showing the arrest of the alleged saboteur and several vials found on his premises, which purportedly contained the toxic substance, also known as 3-Quinuclidinyl Benzilate. Prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Convention, BZ induces hallucinations, delirium, blindness, and inability to perform basic tasks. “The results of the investigation show that Western nations professing to have a wish to begin dialogue on strategic stability with us are effectively the developers and providers of chemical warfare agents prohibited under the [Chemical Weapons] Convention to Ukraine,” Lysogosky said on Monday, as quoted by TASS. He also criticized the fact that Russia had been replaced on the executive council of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) by Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania last November after failing to get enough votes to retain its seat. In February, the head of Russia’s Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Protection Forces, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, accused Ukrainian forces of using banned chemical warfare agents on the battlefield. He claimed that Washington had been aiding and abetting Kiev in these activities. According to the general, the two nations had thus violated the OPCW’s charter. The Russian commander cited several cases from last year, including one in which Ukrainian troops dropped US-made gas grenades containing “CS” compound on Russian positions. This chemical is classified as a riot-control tool that irritates the eyes and upper respiratory tract, and can cause skin burns, respiratory paralysis and cardiac arrest when deployed in high concentrations. The general also claimed at the time that Ukraine was incorporating the use of chemical weapons into its military doctrine, under the auspices of its Western backers. In support of this claim, Kirillov cited an order for hundreds of thousands of antidotes, gas masks and other personal protective equipment that Kiev had supposedly placed with the European Union. According to Kirillov, the OPCW had not responded to evidential materials presented by Russia. The general concluded that the international body was being effectively run by the US, and used as a tool to target its political opponents.",DISINFORMATION

The four suspected perpetrators had previously been identified as radical Islamists, recruited through an online chat apparently operated by the Afghanistan-based offshoot of Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS). However, the investigators said at the time that, despite the group’s claim of responsibility for the terrorist act, another party, such as a Ukrainian intelligence agency, may have been involved in the plot. Last Friday, a group of men armed with assault rifles stormed the Crocus City Hall music venue in the Moscow suburb of Krasnogorsk, just before a concert by the rock band Picnic. The attack and a subsequent blaze started by the perpetrators claimed the lives of 144 people and injured over 200 others. The assailants were apprehended hours after the attack in Russia’s Bryansk Region, which borders Ukraine.",DISINFORMATION

There are reportedly several specialized trains which CNN described on Thursday as being highly classified and at risk of being targeted by Russia. The train’s onboard director featured in the report told the network that an ICU unit is part of the carriage layout and that “we can do almost everything here.” He later clarified that medics on board can only do minor operations to stop bleeding and can’t even call outside consultants. The report also claimed that “there have recently been several strikes targeting the vicinity of railway stations and other infrastructure,” suggesting that Russian forces would target them. However, Ukraine also uses railways to transport weapons and reinforcements to the front line, deliveries which Russia has targeted on multiple occasions. Moscow insists that unlike Kiev, it never attacks non-military targets. Earlier this week, the secretary of the Russian Security Council, Sergey Shoigu, cited Ukrainian military casualties as he accused Kiev of rejecting multiple opportunities to deflate the tensions and end the hostilities. “There was a first wave of mobilization, second wave of mobilization… They have reduced the age limit for mobilization. This was not necessary,” he said in an interview. “Every day they lose 28 square kilometers on average. Every day,” the official added. “But the most important thing is that they lose up to 2,000 people every day.” Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky claimed in February that his country had suffered around 31,000 battlefield fatalities. The Russian Defense Ministry has estimated that the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Region, which Kiev launched last month, already cost its military over 12,000 casualties as of Wednesday. Kiev introduced a new draft system this year to boost the rate at which it forcibly enlists citizens into military service.",DISINFORMATION

When Ukrainian forces launched an incursion into Kursk Region last month, thousands of civilians were evacuated or themselves fled deeper into the Russian heartland. Some however, including elderly people and those with disabilities, were unable to leave, and their settlements fell under Ukrainian control. According to a new report seen by RIA Novosti, those left behind were subjected to detention methods synonymous with World War II. “In a number of territories controlled by militants, something like ‘concentration camps’ were created, which civilians who did not want or were unable to leave the territory captured by the enemy were forcibly driven into,” the report said, according to RIA Novosti. These claims were based on eyewitness accounts collected by the Russian Red Cross in Kursk. Of those detained, between 70 and 100 were taken to a school in Sudzha, where some of the fiercest fighting took place. Once there, they were subjected to psychological abuse and presented to foreign journalists, RIA Novosti claimed. “These journalists not only illegally violated the border of the Russian Federation, they did so as part of the paramilitary punitive units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces,” the report said. “Their goal is the deliberate distortion of real events – the creation of a favorable media background for the actions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Kursk Region and the concealment of information about terrorist crimes against civilians.” Russian authorities have already filed criminal charges against Italian and American reporters who entered Kursk with Ukrainian troops and interviewed civilians in Sudzha. Ukrainian commanders ordered the Kursk incursion in an attempt to force Russia to pull troops from the front line near Donetsk, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Colonel General Aleksandr Syrsky, said last month. However, Syrsky said the gamble had not paid off, and that Russian forces had since doubled their efforts in Donetsk and captured multiple settlements previously held by Ukrainian forces. The Ukrainian advance in Kursk was quickly stopped. After several weeks of attacks from Russian ground and air forces, Ukraine has lost more than 12,500 service members, 101 tanks, and hundreds of armored vehicles, according to the latest figures from the Russian Defense Ministry. In a statement on Thursday, the ministry said Russian forces had liberated ten villages near the Ukrainian border in the previous 48 hours, and repelled several counterattacks. Despite suffering massive casualties and failing to relieve pressure on the Donetsk front, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky claimed on Thursday that “everything is going in accordance with our Ukrainian plan” to defeat Russia.",DISINFORMATION
https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/ursula-von-der-leyen-is-an-unelected-omnipotent-authoritarian-bureaucrat/,https://www.rt.com/news/596642-europe-death-macron-france/,2024-04-26,"‘Our Europe could die,’ Macron says. Who’s the killer? “We must be clear about the fact that our Europe today is mortal,” French President Emmanuel Macron said in a speech this week. “She can die, and it depends only on our choices. But these choices are to be made now.” What Macron portrays as an urgent need to resuscitate the EU comes after he himself has spent nearly seven years in power, having even been president of the Council of the European Union in 2022. He’s been credited for the nomination and confirmation of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, described by Forbes last year as the world’s most powerful woman. Or, as some might say, an unelected, omnipotent bureaucrat whose supranational authoritarianism supersedes the democratic process of member states. Or, as others might now say after Macron’s address, the Nurse Ratched at the EU’s deathbed. Macron’s interminable speech should have been one big mea culpa on behalf of the EU’s establishment class. Tell us how you screwed up. At least then we’d know that there was hope for an actual course correction rather than just more of the same. Instead, Macron argued that the EU hasn’t ever been a vassal of Washington. Saying that you’re not a vassal is exactly like having to tell people you’re not a prostitute. It’s not something that one has to go around saying if the optics aren’t already glaring. Queen Ursula is basically America’s viceroy in Europe at this point, and Macron himself can’t seem to manage to carve out any positions independent of the US that last longer than the time it takes for Uncle Sam to reach over and administer a transatlantic spanking. Macron’s speech was a fascinating blend of delusion and insecurity. He chose Paris’ Sorbonne University as the venue. The theme? “Stocktake of European action.” Sure, tell us what’s really going on as though you had a clue – and an actual strategy and vision that wasn’t subjected to the constant whims and trends of the moment or any given election cycle. Macron gave a similar speech at the Sorbonne in September 2017. Why there? Because as Macron said last time, “living collectively was the ideal of Robert de Sorbon” – the theologian who founded the university. It just so happens that circling the drain collectively is what the EU is really all about right now, thanks to the special brand of iron-fisted incompetence of those in charge. There’s a European Parliament election coming up, and the populists are surging in the polls right now. The first step to recovery is admitting that there’s a problem. Macron, however, apparently feels compelled to do the opposite of that, and talk about all of the EU’s failures as though they’re successes. Like counterterrorism, for instance. France has made such great progress on that front that the country is now back on the highest alert just days before it's slated to host the Paris Olympics, including an open air Opening Ceremony along the Seine. It barely seems to have ever been downgraded from high alert; the initially white terror warning signs have been turning yellow from years of light exposure in the windows of buildings where they’re now permanent fixtures. Macron, however, highlighted the role of a new bureaucratic entity called the ECOFIN Council. Because nothing deters terrorists more than meetings. In addressing Africa, Macron underscored the importance of another meeting: the “European Union - Africa Summit” held two years ago. The sparse content in the Africa section of Macron’s talk could be explained by minor details like French troops being drop-kicked back across the Mediterranean by African countries after French stability missions resulted in coups (which are kind of the opposite of stability). Clearly not deterred by any inconvenient discrepancies between reality and projected fantasy, Macron’s speech also celebrated addressing the migration challenge, which the EU has basically paid to outsource to countries like Turkey, Tunisia, Mauritania and Egypt. The last I checked, none of these countries were actually in Europe. But the EU has outsourced almost everything else by this point, so they may as well. Macron talked about the EU leading the ecological and environmental transition. To what, exactly? Poverty, probably. Just ask the farmers straitjacketed by Brussels' climate change diktats, their farmland being spied on by satellites to ensure compliance, how great that is. He brought up the EU’s energy sovereignty and reindustrialization. Not so fast; Germany in particular is still busy going in the opposite direction and de-industrializing. So it might be a while before the EU’s economic engine comes out on the flip side. The EU has become more dependent on pricier American liquefied natural gas, which sounds like the opposite of sovereignty. France’s own LNG imports from the country the EU implies an explicit need to be sovereign from — Russia — are now up 75% in the first few months of this year, compared to a year ago. France was Russia’s top customer for LNG in Europe last February, according to a Politico report. For all the noise it makes, it’s not like the EU has stopped importing gas from Russia. They just replaced their Russian pipeline gas imports with Russian LNG – a billion dollars worth of Russian arctic liquified natural gas into the EU every month, to be exact. In 2023, the bloc was actually still importing 15% of its pipeline gas from Russia, according to Reuters. While that’s down from 45% before the conflict in Ukraine, it still might come as a shock to people who were actually listening to Brussels brag about how they were sticking it to Putin by depriving him of energy revenues, that they were still importing any pipeline gas at all. The NGO Global Witness reported last year that the EU really just pivoted to importing Russian liquefied natural gas, instead of pipeline gas, with Russian LNG imports into the EU jumping 40% since the onset of the conflict — even more than in each of the previous two years. Speaking of Ukraine, Macron said that “the sina qua non condition for our security is that Russia does not win the war of aggression it is waging against Ukraine. This is essential.” What’s more essential is that Macron should spell out what Ukraine “winning” actually means. It would seem that Ukraine not continuing to senselessly grind down its demographics should be seen as a win, given the non-zero chance of a battlefield game-changer that risks igniting a Third World War. Macron, however, clearly has other ideas, what with all his cosplaying as Napoleon Bonaparte and fantasizing about smoking Russians by openly talking about sending French troops to Ukraine. Not that Ukraine is actually in the EU, but Macron now explains that the EU has “started to rethink our geography within the boundaries of our neighborhood.” Imagine the EU’s reaction to Russia uttering those same words. In the end, however, this is just another speech, calibrated for maximum impact ahead of the upcoming June EU parliamentary elections. Like much of what EU leaders such as Macron are peddling nowadays, firehosing reality and diluting it with ideological rhetoric might tug on a few hearts, but won’t win over any brain that isn’t totally shot full of holes like a block of Comté.

He added that Telegram has been “the darling of the CIA, the State Department, and USAID” for political operations worldwide, due to its nearly billion users and the ease with which they can be directed to necessary channels for recruitment. The comments were made during an interview with American journalist Tucker Carlson on Wednesday. Benz, a State Department official under the administration of former President Donald Trump, now runs the free speech watchdog Foundation for Freedom Online. Carlson asked Benz about a potential US role in the arrest of Telegram co-founder and CEO Pavel Durov in France last week. A court in Paris charged Durov on Wednesday with complicity in several crimes perpetrated through his app, as well as failing to cooperate with the French authorities. While the former diplomat did not speculate, he noted that Durov’s arrest aligns with the pattern of “soft power” tactics the US has pursued in the past. The US has championed free speech globally for decades, “in large part” because it allows the country to build resistance and political or paramilitary movements “in countries where the US State Department seeks political control,” the former official said. Durov’s end-to-end encrypted social media app Telegram has been instrumental in this effort, Benz claimed. The reason “26 US-government-funded NGOs” condemned Russia for attempting to ban Telegram in 2018 was that “the US State Department was using Telegram,” utilizing its encryption and local popularity “to foment protests and riots within Russia – just as they did in Belarus, Iran, Hong Kong, and attempted to do in China,” the former State Department official said. The app’s encryption is a powerful means of evading state control over media and allowing “US-funded political groups or dissidents to garner tens of thousands of supporters with relative impunity,” he added. Benz claimed that Telegram was the “main channel” when the US was “effectively orchestrating a color revolution in Belarus” in 2020. “The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) was actually paying the main administrators of the Telegram channels that orchestrated those riots,” he said, calling the NED “one of the most prolific CIA cutouts in the arsenal.” This practice is part of a long-running campaign by the US, UK, and other NATO partners to gain political control over the territories of the former Soviet Union and their resources, according to Benz.",DISINFORMATION
https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/germany-is-a-tightly-controlled-dependent-us-colony/,https://www.rt.com/news/607841-germany-has-become-europes-wasteland/,2024-11-18,"Germany has become Europe’s political wasteland Germany is a political void in the center of Europe, even though it contributes significantly to the global economy and is influential in trade. It’s also the Western country with which Russia has had the most historical, cultural and, until recently, economic contacts. A week ago the government in Berlin collapsed, and so far the leading German parties have agreed that early parliamentary elections will be in February 2025. It’s very likely that the next government will be led by the main opposition force, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). At the start of the election campaign, CDU leader Friedrich Merz publicly announced that – if he wins – he’ll issue an ultimatum to Moscow over Ukraine. He’s promised that if this ultimatum is not accepted within 24 hours, his government will provide the Kiev regime with cruise missiles to attack Russian territory. The consequences of such a decision for Russian-Western relations are obvious. It is not surprising, therefore, that our main reaction was astonishment at the irresponsibility of such a high-ranking member of the German elite. There are even fears that Merz and those behind him intend to drag Germany into a destructive military conflict with Europe’s largest country. But all this German talk means nothing in practice. Without US authorisation, or direct orders from Washington, the leaders in Berlin are not only incapable of starting a major war in Europe, they are incapable even of adjusting their shoelaces. Any statements by German politicians, the fall and rise of governing coalitions there, should only be seen in the context of how the Berlin establishment is trying to find a role in the shadow of total American dominance. It’s deeply symbolic that Chancellor Olaf Scholz took a decisive step towards the collapse of the governing coalition on 6 November, the day on which the domestic political balance of power in the United States changed radically. In the context of significant changes at the center, the peripheral political systems must react as sensitively as possible: at the level of how a branch of a large corporation reacts to a change in its general management. Berlin’s international position is defined by its crushing defeat in the Second World War, which ended any hope of determining its own future. Germany, like Japan and South Korea, is a country with a foreign occupying force on its territory, albeit under the NATO flag. The German elite, both political and economic, is, with few exceptions, even more integrated with the US than the British elite. To say nothing of those running France, Italy or other European countries. Germany has no autonomy in determining its foreign policy, nor does it aspire to have any. It’s no coincidence that over the past two and a half years of the Ukraine crisis, it’s been Berlin that has provided the largest amount of military and financial aid to the Kiev regime. Almost ten times more than, say, France, whose president likes to make bellicose speeches. Naturally, the representatives of the German establishment look like pale copies of what we used to consider real politicians. And this is a natural product of the loss of any possibility of determining their own destiny. Of course, Berlin can still set the parameters of economic policy for the weak countries of the European Mediterranean. States such as Greece, Italy or Spain are given to Germany to ‘feed’ within the framework of the European Union and its single currency. But even Poland, which has a special relationship with the US, has managed to avoid tying itself to Germany’s industrial grip. France is resisting slightly. But it is gradually sinking to the level of southern Europe. The UK has left the EU, but retains its position as the main representative of the US in Europe. It should be noted that such a state of affairs for Germany did not come about overnight. Even during the Cold War, the Federal Republic (FRG) was led by bright personalities. Under chancellors such as Willy Brandt (1969-1974), the Moscow Treaty was signed between the FRG and the USSR on the recognition of post-war borders in Europe. In the early 1970s, German politicians and business were able to persuade the US to allow Germany to establish energy cooperation with the Soviets. In our time, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder (1998-2005) pushed for European energy security based on German-Russian cooperation. But all this came to an end with the global economic crisis of 2008-2013, after which the US began to tighten the screws on its allies. In the spring of 2022, Olaf Scholz, who had previously been committed to dialogue with Russia, fully supported the military-political confrontation created by the Americans over Ukraine. Now German politicians are not free to choose their own future. For most of them, with the exception of the non-systemic opposition, this is quite obvious. Why appoint bright personalities to the highest positions if nothing depends on their decisions? Gradually, the entire political system and the mood of the electorate are adapting to these conditions. The differences in the parties’ platforms are becoming blurred. Observers are already talking about the likelihood that the government will be formed by the Social Democrats and their main opponents from the CDU. This means that disagreements on fundamental issues are a thing of the past. Only the technical aspects of forming a government need to be agreed upon, and the main goal of all efforts is to hold on to power as such. The united and sovereign German state existed for 74 years (1871-1945). Its revival as such is not possible: even if Russia and China would look favourably on it, the Anglo-Saxon world will not allow it for several reasons at once. Firstly, both German attempts – in the First and Second World Wars – to play a leading role in the West came close to succeeding. So nobody will give them a third chance. Just to be on the safe side. It should be borne in mind that the West takes order within its own community even more seriously than it does the defence of its privileges against the rest of humanity. Second, Germany’s position at the center of Europe, its huge industrial base and its industrious population make it an ideal partner for the US and Britain, the maritime trading powers. Politically insignificant, Germany can economically control much of the rest of Europe, but cannot dictate the substance. Third, the revival of visible German independence is in the interests of Moscow and Beijing because it would split the ranks of the consolidated West. A small front of countries like Hungary, Slovakia or even one a little larger cannot create such a split. And the unity of the West under the leadership of the US is a fundamental obstacle to the implementation of the plans for a multipolar world order promoted by Russia and China. Germany is now a political wasteland in the heart of Europe. Tiny shoots of reason are, of course, breaking through the decades-old system based on pandering to the interests of American patrons. With some very obvious exceptions, the representatives of the non-systemic German opposition are talented people. But their prospects are still very dim because of the way things are manage. In the future, we can expect to re-establish some economic ties with Germany but we must treat it as a political colony of the US, rather than thinking about try to establish full inter-state relations with Berlin.

Georgescu never declared himself as a pro-Russian politician, Ciurea noted, he merely wants peace in the region, which in turn would mean resolving the Ukrainian conflict – something that Romania’s political elite does not want. These views of his led to Georgescu being automatically branded as pro-Russian, which is unacceptable in Romania and by default pushes them to the political fringe, Ciurea explains. This, he says, allows the Romanian political elite to regard Georgescu as an extremist.

Such an attack, Ritter explains, might be regarded as a prelude to a “larger military incursion” meant to accomplish the US’ ultimate goal, “the strategic defeat of Russia.” “Russia has made it clear that as a nuclear power, it not only will not, but cannot be defeated strategically - because if such a possibility manifested itself, Russia would be required to use its nuclear arsenal to ensure that outcome would never, never occur. This means general nuclear war,” he says. Ritter also recalls the warnings made by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov who questioned the US’ apparent belief that a Russia-NATO conflict would be limited to Europe and who said that a Russian retaliatory strike against the United States is possible if such a conflict were to break out. “This is a very dangerous escalation, one that could rapidly create the conditions conducive for not limited nuclear conflict, but a general nuclear war, a global-ending global disaster, the destruction of the US, the destruction of Russia, the destruction of Europe, the destruction of the world. Why? Because the US and NATO will not be honest about the state of affairs in Ukraine today,” laments Ritter. Ukraine has already “lost the war,"" he adds, and nothing that Kiev might do to try and “tip the scales” in its favor is going to change that. “All it will do is provoke Russia into enlarging this conflict so that it's not just Ukraine that pays the price, but Europe, the US, and the rest of the world,” Ritter says. “Hopefully, the Ukrainian Defense Minister Andrei Yermak will be received by the US, and have their recommendations regarding using long-range weapons to strike deep inside Russia rejected. Because there's only one outcome if the US greenlights this escalation, and that is total nuclear war.”",DISINFORMATION

The new information is further evidence of an international criminal conspiracy going back decades, experts tell Sputnik. 2024-08-27T19:42+0000 2024-08-27T19:42+0000 2024-08-27T19:42+0000 analysis military & intelligence igor nikulin cia big pharma moldova russia ukraine “The United States is reportedly continuing its efforts to develop bioagents capable of selectively targeting different ethnic groups,” RCBD Troops chief Igor Kirillov said in a briefing Tuesday on the US government, military and Big Pharma’s ongoing military-biological activities in Ukraine.“According to available information, the United States has begun to actively involve Moldova and Romania in its biomaterial logistics schemes” for the transfer of the biomaterials of Ukrainians out of the country, Kirillov said, detailing how Russia's special military operation has forced the US and its allies to adjust their tactics and try to cover their tracks.Sputnik has been reporting on suspected US efforts to develop bioweapons targeting specific ethnic groups and genotypes since 2017, pointing to academic papers, DARPA research documents, and policy papers like the infamous September 2000 ‘Rebuilding America’s Defenses’ paper by the Project for a New American Century, which cited the dawning of an advanced new form of warfare “that can ‘target’ specific genotypes” and “transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool.”From March 2022 onward, the RCBD Troops have been detailing US and NATO efforts in Ukraine to develop viruses targeting certain ethnic groups, infect local flora and fauna, and be spread naturally by migrating birds, mosquitos, waterways and other means.Visions of a Nightmarish 21th Century from the Twilight of the 20th“The Americans first showed interest in the Slavic ethnic group and genome in the early 1990s, perhaps even earlier. In the early 1990s, I worked on the Human Genome Project as a junior research fellow at the Institute of Molecular Biology of the Academy of Sciences. The Americans would ask not only for our decoding work, but all the source materials as well, supposedly for verification.

The new information is further evidence of an international criminal conspiracy going back decades, experts tell Sputnik. “The United States is reportedly continuing its efforts to develop bioagents capable of selectively targeting different ethnic groups,” RCBD Troops chief Igor Kirillov said in a briefing Tuesday on the US government, military and Big Pharma’s ongoing military-biological activities in Ukraine. “According to available information, the United States has begun to actively involve Moldova and Romania in its biomaterial logistics schemes” for the transfer of the biomaterials of Ukrainians out of the country, Kirillov said, detailing how Russia's special military operation has forced the US and its allies to adjust their tactics and try to cover their tracks. “Such tactics can conceal the final recipient and divert suspicions away from US government agencies and the US biological warfare program,” Kirillov added. Sputnik has been reporting on suspected US efforts to develop bioweapons targeting specific ethnic groups and genotypes since 2017, pointing to academic papers, DARPA research documents, and policy papers like the infamous September 2000 ‘Rebuilding America’s Defenses’ paper by the Project for a New American Century, which cited the dawning of an advanced new form of warfare “that can ‘target’ specific genotypes” and “transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool.” From March 2022 onward, the RCBD Troops have been detailing US and NATO efforts in Ukraine to develop viruses targeting certain ethnic groups, infect local flora and fauna, and be spread naturally by migrating birds, mosquitos, waterways and other means. Visions of a Nightmarish 21th Century from the Twilight of the 20th “The task was set back in 1999 by then-CIA director George Tenet to create pathogens that would be ethnicity-specific. Tenet, one could say, is the main villain of the 21st century, outdoing even Bill Gates on this question,” Igor Nikulin, a Russian military expert and former member of the UN Commission on Chemical and Biological Weapons, told Sputnik, commenting on the RCBD Troops’ latest revelations. “The Americans first showed interest in the Slavic ethnic group and genome in the early 1990s, perhaps even earlier. In the early 1990s, I worked on the Human Genome Project as a junior research fellow at the Institute of Molecular Biology of the Academy of Sciences. The Americans would ask not only for our decoding work, but all the source materials as well, supposedly for verification. Then, during what was still the Soviet Union, hundreds if not thousands of samples went overseas to these very same American and European laboratories. So, for all these years, various companies, foundations and non-governmental organizations have been collecting the genetic materials of Russians,” Nikulin said. As for the idea of bioweapons targeting certain ethnic groups, it’s been known about since at least the 1930s, the observer stressed. “Atypical pneumonia, let’s say, targets the Slavs, the same as typhus, which the Japanese discovered in the 1930s affects mainly white Europeans. Delta-Omicron strains of Covid affect Asians – the Chinese, Koreans and Vietnamese. Ebola affects Africans, and is a product of high [bio]technology never before recorded. MERS (Middle East Acute Respiratory Syndromes) targets Arabs. So there are already specific approaches for every national and racial group,” Nikulin explained. Former Executive Intelligence Review White House correspondent William Jones believes the diabolical logic behind US military biological research in the former Soviet space from the 1990s onward is not far off from that of the Nazis during WWII. “Most disconcerting are General Kirillov’s statements that blood samples are also being transported back to US labs for the selection of biological agents that are most dangerous for the population of a certain region that target a particular group of people. This gives an even more sinister touch that puts US policy in the same realm as the Wannsee Conference in 1942, where General Reinhard Heydrich revealed his plans for a ‘final solution’ to the ‘Jewish question’,” Jones told Sputnik. “Many of these labs had been set up during Soviet times, but with the fall of the Soviet Union and the creation of an independent Ukraine, US inspectors, with the [stated] intention of eliminating the biological weapons there, have actually utilized and expanded them with the thought of a possible conflict with the Russian Federation,” the observer stressed. Client States Do Dirty Work Nikulin was not surprised by Kirillov’s comments about the new transport scheme involving Moldova, and using of the logistics companies Gamma Logistics and Aerotranscargo, which, according to the Russian MoD, are controlled by Moldovan President Maia Sandu. This logistical network is both convenient and secure in the sense that the Moldovan government can be relied on not to ask any “unnecessary questions,” the observer believes. “One thing is clear: Maia Sandu is an agent, possibly of the CIA, or maybe the State Department. That is, she is their woman, carrying out their assignments in Eastern Europe. She is also involved in the dirtiest businesses, starting with the trade in children and organs organized by the ‘defenders’ of Ukraine, which are very actively bought up by black transplantologists from the US, Israel, Britain and other countries,” Nikulin said.",DISINFORMATION

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has promised to raise the issue of the list of those killed in Bucha during Russia’s presidency of the United Nations Security Council. ""I will go to New York next week. Russia is currently holding presidency of the UN Security Council. We well consider the tasks of multilateral cooperation, ensuring equal and indivisible security. Naturally, we will speak about how the West is seeking to manipulate everything and everyone. I would like to hear what they would say in response to the question which has been asked a dozen of times: can we have a look at the list of those whose bodies were shown by CNN correspondents in Bucha,"" he said in an interview with VGTRK journalist Pavel Zarubin, who posted it on his Telegram channel. ""It’s a shame when such an elementary thing remains unanswered. As is our request to show the progress of the investigation of the terror attack on the Nord Stream pipelines. That’s all,"" he said. ""And everything else the West is accusing us of should be returned to their court."" When asked why some tragic developments in Ukraine always happen ahead of NATO summits or major talks, Lavrov said, ""Representatives of our defense and foreign ministries have commented this topic more than once. Journalists keep on raising this topic because those who are behind these provocations want this topic to be dropped."" Lavrov will chair UN Security Council debates on June 16 and 17. Russia took over presidency of the UN Security Council on July 1, 2024. It plans to focus attention on issues of building a fairer, more democratic and sustainable world order, the Middle East settlement, as well as the United Nations’ cooperation with the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). In all, it is planned to hold around 20 open sessions and closed debates during the month of Russia’s presidency. Bucha false flag In April 2022, Russian Investigative Committee Chairman Alexander Bastrykin said a criminal case had been opened after the Ukrainian provocation in the town of Bucha, Kiev region, under Article 207.3 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (public dissemination of deliberately false information about the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation). He noted that the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, in order to discredit the Russian army, supplied the Western media with what was allegedly footage from Bucha as proof of the mass killing of civilians in a deliberate and pre-planned false flag. However, it is known, including from the statements from the head of the Bucha administration of March 31, 2022, that the Russian army left the settlement as early as March 30. The video that appeared immediately after the withdrawal of Russian troops, filmed by Ukrainians and circulated on social media, said nothing about the killings and death of civilians.",DISINFORMATION

In an interview with the Russian daily Izvestia on Friday, Azarov, who led Ukraine's national government between 2010 and 2014 when a violent Western-backed coup in Kiev plunged the country into a decade of bloody turmoil, suggested that a significant portion of Ukrainians are reluctant to keep fighting. ”I don’t think that most people want the conflict to continue or to return to the 1991 borders,” the ex-official said, explaining that an ordinary Ukrainian married couple does not want their son to go to the front only to die in the trenches. Kiev has repeatedly insisted that peace is possible only if Moscow withdraws from Crimea and four other former Ukrainian regions that overwhelmingly voted to become part of Russia in 2014 and 2022, respectively. However, Azarov also pointed out that a significant part of Ukrainian society has been “zombified” by national TV. “Every 5–10 minutes they get pummeled by news about ‘Russian orcs’. Many are now being brought up in the spirit of hatred, resentment, and so on,” he noted. He added, however, that this does not mean 90% of Ukrainians are “ready to grab a weapon and run into the trenches and die for no reason.” Azarov lamented that the Ukrainian political elite has been virtually wiped out over the past 10 years. “There are practically no people there who have even an ounce of common sense left. There are [only] opportunists, blank spaces. They will do whatever the Americans tell them”. Ukraine can only recover if its current leaders are replaced, the ex-PM argued. He stressed that this does not mean Kiev would become either pro-Russian or pro-American, but rather that it will return to “the realm of common sense.” Azarov’s comments come after the New York Times reported last month that Ukrainians are getting tired of the national broadcast because it paints “too rosy a picture” of the conflict with Russia while downplaying Kiev’s military defeats. The reported propaganda fatigue comes on the heels of Ukraine’s much-hyped counteroffensive last year that failed to gain any substantial ground. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu estimated Kiev’s losses last month at more than 215,000 troops in 2023 alone.",DISINFORMATION
https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/kyiv-committed-genocide-in-the-donbas/,https://www.rt.com/russia/591346-ukraine-genocide-donbass-putin/,2024-01-26,"Ukraine committed ‘genocide’ in Donbass – Putin Kiev’s actions in Donbass between 2014 and 2022 were nothing short of “genocide,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday. The post-Maidan coup authorities in Ukraine were determined to “physically” get rid of anyone who still supported the development of good relations with Moscow, he added. Russia cited the need to protect the people of Donbass from continued persecution by Kiev as one of the major reasons it launched its military operation in February 2022. In the wake of the 2014 Maidan coup, two former Ukrainian territories with predominantly Russian-speaking populations declared their independence from Kiev and created the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics. The post-coup Ukrainian government responded by launching an “anti-terrorist” operation against the two Donbass republics, sparking a protracted conflict that has raged ever since, in one form or another. Russia initially sought to resolve the issue through the later-derailed Minsk Agreements, which envisaged a special autonomous status for the two republics within Ukraine. Moscow repeatedly accused Kiev of failing to implement the terms of the accords. In 2022, former German chancellor Angela Merkel admitted that the accords brokered by Russia, Germany, and France in 2015 were merely a strategic ploy aimed at buying Ukraine more time to prepare for a conflict with Russia. ”Everything that was happening there… was genocide,” Putin said on Friday, referring to the events that had been unfolding in Donbass between 2014 and 2022. “This cannot be called otherwise,” he said, adding that people were being “exterminated.” He also pointed to the fact that Kiev’s forces continued to fight the Donbass militias after the Minsk Agreements had already been signed. According to the president, Russia’s “geopolitical adversaries understood that they could not just turn Ukraine upside-down with its Russian-speaking population in the southeast.” The 2014 coup opened the way for the “physical extermination of anyone who was willing to develop normal relations with Russia,” Putin said, adding that “it had become clear that we would not be allowed to build normal relations with our neighbor.” Ukraine was being turned into an “anti-Russian” state, the president said, adding that such developments had left Moscow no choice to avoid launching its military operation. Putin has repeatedly referred to Ukraine’s policies in Donbass as “genocide.” In June 2022, several months into the conflict with Ukraine, he said “there can be no other definition for the Kiev regime’s actions than ‘a crime against humanity’.” In February 2022, just days before the start of the Russian campaign, the nation’s Investigative Committee reported that more than 2,600 civilians had been killed over the past eight years amid the conflict in Donbass. More than 5,500 civilians were injured over the same period, it added. A UN report published in January 2022 put the total number of deaths linked to the Donbass conflict at that time at more than 14,000. At least 3,400 of them were civilians, including more than 150 children, it added.",DISINFORMATION
https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/natos-steadfast-defender-exercise-is-a-brainwashing-operation-to-justify-war/,https://www.rt.com/news/591608-steadfast-defender-2024-nato/,2024-02-07,"How NATO brainwashes Western society with its anti-Russia wargames NATO has launched its largest exercise since the Cold War ended. Steadfast Defender 2024 will last several months and involve about 90,000 troops, over 50 naval vessels, 1,100 ground vehicles (including at least 133 tanks and 533 armored troop carriers), and 80 aircraft of various kinds (planes, helicopters, and drones). All 31 alliance members will participate, as will Sweden, which is in the process of joining. However, it’s not only a matter of numbers and duration. The massive event is also special for two more reasons, one fairly straightforward, the other more complicated and worthy of serious scrutiny. In simple terms, the exercise will test regional defense plans, which NATO has not done since the end of the Cold War. A political benefit of returning to such detailed plans is that they provide leverage, in essence to Washington through NATO’s SACEUR office, to make European governments toe the line by committing troops, gear, and money. That is what The Economist pointed out, with satisfaction, at the time of last year’s Vilnius summit, when all of this was set in motion. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko’s observation is correct: The maneuver marks an “irrevocable return” of the alliance to Cold War mode, although, this, too, is only a new peak of a long period of aggressive development. Hence its no surprise either that the enemy targeted in this imaginary fight is Russia (even if appearing only as a “near-peer adversary” in Steadfast Defender’s official announcement). The more complicated issue is that the exercise was preceded by a veritable onslaught of propaganda - or in up-to-date NATO-speak, cognitive warfare. One dead give-away that this has been deliberate is that the Western think tank/information-war platform the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) is already accusing Russia of engaging in “an information operation to misrepresent” the purely “defensive” Steadfast Defender. Remember the old rule of thumb: Usually, what the West accuses others of doing (for instance, genocide) is what it is doing itself. In reality, NATO's representatives and spin masters (official and in the guise of academics and think tank experts), politicians, and journalists were laying down a narrative barrage. Through official statements, interviews, and even Tom-Clancy-style fantasy scenarios, the Western public, especially in the EU, was made to imagine a scary – and near – future in which Moscow launches an invasion of European NATO member states. In this sense, “Steadfast Defender” is not merely a return to Cold War patterns but to the dark tone of its most virulent and dangerous phases, for instance, the early 1980s. Think of deep-frosted Cold War Hollywood classics such as “Firefox,” where Clint Eastwood steals a Soviet super-jet, or (the original) “Red Dawn,” where valiant American teenagers die heroically fending off evil Russians (and Cubans!) who had landed smack in the middle of America's heartland. That kind of vibe. It’s important to note that there is nothing self-evident about this propaganda blitz. NATO could conduct its big maneuver but make less of a fuss about it. Or accompany it with a different, less strident message, stressing due security diligence but refraining from detailed statements about Russia’s putative actions, as it were, tomorrow. Hence, this cognitive warfare offensive is deliberate. It was driven so far, that, after the initial wave attack of panic-mongering; even the formal figurehead of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, got cold feet and felt compelled to remind everyone that there is “no direct threat.” Let’s look at some examples of this remarkable propaganda offensive: Not-yet-even-NATO member Sweden hurried to display exemplary verbal militancy: Its commander-in-chief General Micael Bydén urged his fellow Swedes to “prepare themselves mentally” for war, while Civil Defense Minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin stressed that “war could come to Sweden.” (It seems abandoning neutrality can make you more anxious.) Partly in response to Bydén, Germany’s minister of Defense Boris Pistorius then shared his wild guess that a Russian attack on a NATO country could occur within less than ten years. In a press conference, the chairman of NATO’s military committee, Dutch admiral Rob Bauer, followed up by striking the same tone, albeit with more details. Bauer spoke about operations to shape the armed forces of the alliance for decades, a historically unprecedent degree of integration between NATO and national defense plans, and “resilience” to be cultivated by a “whole-of-society approach” to war as well as to preparing for war. All of this may sound grandiloquent. However, it would be a mistake not to take it seriously. Such rhetoric signals that NATO is asserting itself as a background, yet dominant, political force, claiming, openly, all of society – across all those “unprecedently” integrated national governments and in peacetime – as its legitimate and permanent domain of action. Listening closely to Bauer’s imperious remarks, delivered in a tone of stern admonition, one can’t help but realize that Steadfast Defender 2024 is not merely about 2024, or about armies. It is meant to set political and social trajectories going forward. British generals have kept illustrating this side of the NATO propaganda offensive with repeated public musings about the need to introduce conscription and plan for a war against Russia. The NATO war talk barrage is also not only about Russia. In a way, it is even more about the European NATO member states’ societies: a very clear reminder that their sovereignty is worth about as much as that of Greece when the “Troika” of Western overlords came knocking in 2015. None of this is surprising, of course: as a key tool of US control and European (self-)subjugation, NATO has always been a through-and-through imperialistic (in the technical, not polemical sense of the term) tool of US power projection and control in Europe. Now, with the EU submitting to America to the point of serious self-harm, Bauer's style of cajoling Europeans is only consistent. However, there is something remarkable about how brazenly NATO is displaying its will to power now, especially against the background of Donald Trump, a declared NATO foe, now the man most likely to win the American presidential elections at the end of this year: This could turn out to be NATO’s last hurrah. For the mass media handling of the messaging offensive around Steadfast Defender 2024, let’s pick just two examples. The hyper-popular British tabloid The Sun was as blunt as you would expect, hammering its readers with the headline “GEARING UP FOR WAR: Nato calls up biggest global force in DECADES with 90,000 troops to begin ‘Steadfast Defender’ WW3 drills in days.” The rest of the article is as sensationalist as the title promises, including allegations of a Russian plan to attack on “Day X” as early as 2025. More of a middle-class paper, the British Daily Mail was a tad more subtle, running a long, illustrated piece (with big red arrows on maps and all that) about the “Herculean war games.” Speculating how a Russian attack sometime in the next twenty years would unfold, the paper depicts Moscow’s massive future cyber-attacks, deep missile strikes, and AI-operated tanks on the move. (Clearly, the times of Westerners fantasizing about Russian soldiers storming forward with nothing but shovels are well and truly over.) Hapless retired US general Ben Hodges, who last spring still predicted a victorious Ukrainian counteroffensive, has moved on and is now prophesying about how Russia’s large coming strike against NATO in Europe will unfold. What is all of this about? The most frightening interpretation would be that NATO is dead set already on fighting Russia, come what may. That would be highly irrational and suicidal, but, then again, the West has not shown much rationality recently. Call it the “Baltic Kamikaze” or “Britain is Suicidally Bored” explanation of NATO behavior. My guess: We are, luckily, not quite there yet. Don’t get me wrong: I am certain that there are nutcases in NATO (and the EU) who’d love to go to war, better yesterday than tomorrow. In that respect, rumors about Kaja Kallas, the would-be iron lady of Estonia being tapped for the de facto EU foreign ministry are very disturbing indeed. Yet what is more likely is a messy internal compromise: Where some already want war, others are playing for something else: Compensating for the West’s looming defeat in Ukraine. This is especially true since the West has made a catastrophic mistake. In treating Ukraine as almost a de facto NATO member, it has made sure that Kiev’s defeat by Russia will call into question the credibility of the alliance nearly as thoroughly as if an official NATO member had been vanquished: overstretch has consequences. Hence an urgent need now to make a lot of noise about how ready (“Seriously, really, we mean it this time!”) the alliance is about defending, especially NATO’s newer, eastern members. But let’s zoom out for a moment: There’s an irony grand strategists like Admiral Bauer miss: If you want the “resilience” of a “whole-of-society approach,” then your society needs to be basically content, with its elites enjoying the ultimate reserve currency of politics - fundamental legitimacy, which sustains polities even when the ruled greatly disagree with the rulers. However, that kind of agreement grows only from trust, which is precisely what all too many citizens of the EU, and the US as well, do not have any more. War – and preparing for war – remain essentially political activities, but not in the shortsighted manner NATO is applying now: Imbuing societies with a sense of a great outside threat can work, for a while. However, it will be futile in the not-so-long-run when two things happen: That outside threat fails to materialize, and, instead, the frustration that most people really feel in their own lives keeps coming from the inside. That’s, by the way, what killed the Soviet Union, which, as some NATO Cold War re-enactors may care to remember, died while armed to the teeth and having practiced “whole-of-society” defense indoctrination for decades.

According to Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, the main goal of those fueling the wave of protests was to undermine the constitutional order, seize power, and attempt a coup. Mass protests in Kazakhstan erupted in early January 2022, with residents of the western cities of Zhanaozen and Aktau protesting a twofold increase in liquefied gas prices. The protests spilled over to other cities, and turned into violent unrest, with looting, attacks on state facilities, and clashes with police. In response, authorities declared a nationwide state of emergency until January 19 and launched an anti-terrorist operation. As a result, Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) peacekeeping forces were deployed to Kazakhstan to help stabilize the situation there. Russian President Vladimir Putin later stated that "" Maidan technologies"" similar to those used in Ukraine in 2014 had been resorted to in Kazakhstan, with the country facing a genuine threat to its statehood.

A reaction on behalf of the United States following the death of Russian blogger Alexey Navalny is another attempt of the American authorities to interfere in Russia’s domestic policy, Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov said. ""The death of a person is always a tragedy,"" the Russian ambassador stated. ""In this situation it is extremely important to figure out all the details of the occurrence."" ""However, local [US] politicians do not want to wait and have already blamed the Russian authorities,"" Antonov continued. ""Here arises a quite natural question: who is the judge? There is another attempt to interfere in the internal policy of the Russian Federation. And death is just an excuse."" ""Such a policy is unacceptable. It would be better for local leaders to focus on the problems of their country that require urgent measures,"" Antonov noted. According to the Russian ambassador: ""Here they are looking for a reason for derogatory attacks, and most importantly, for the introduction of additional sanctions. The main task is to save collapsing Pax Americana based on so called rules."" US President Joe Biden said on Friday that Washington was considering ""a whole number of options"" following the death of Russian blogger Alexey Navalny in prison. ""We are looking at a whole number of options,"" he said when asked, if the US could toughen sanctions against Russia due to Navalny’s death. ""The answer is we don't know exactly what happened. But there is no doubt that the death of the volunteer was a consequence of something that Putin and his thugs did,"" the US president stated. The Federal Penitentiary Service’s Directorate for the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Region said on February 16 that Navalny had died in penal colony No.3 on February 16. According to the penitentiary authority, Navalny felt sick after a walk and fainted. Medics arrived immediately but their more than 30-minute resuscitation efforts failed. The Public Monitoring Commission of the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Region said that Navalny had not complained either about his health or about his incarceration conditions. The region’s human rights ombudsperson also said Navalny made no complaints. Meanwhile, Russian Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov slammed the West’s statements concerning Navalny’s death as rabid and totally inadmissible, bearing in mind that there is no official information about the cause of his death.",DISINFORMATION

Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Lavrov hailed the 12-point initiative first proposed by Beijing in February 2023 on the first anniversary of the conflict. The plan includes a call for a cessation of hostilities, the resumption of peace talks, abandoning a “Cold War mentality,” and respecting the sovereignty of all nations. Lavrov described China’s proposal as the “most clear” compilation of principles and approaches on the matter, noting that all of its points are intertwined. “The most important thing for us is that the Chinese document is based on an analysis of the reasons for current events and [seeks] to eliminate [their] root causes,” the foreign minister said. Lavrov acknowledged that the proposal has received criticism for being “vague,” but added that it nonetheless “is a reasonable plan that the great Chinese civilization has put up for discussion.” In contrast to Beijing’s proposal to end the Ukraine conflict, Kiev’s ten-point peace formula first floated by President Vladimir Zelensky in the autumn of 2022 is nothing more than an “ultimatum,” Lavrov claimed. The document effectively demands Moscow’s capitulation and the withdrawal of its forces to Ukraine’s 1991 borders, he added. The latter arrangement would imply that Kiev would recapture Crimea – which voted overwhelmingly to join Russia in 2014 in a public referendum after a Western-backed coup in Kiev – as well as four other former territories that followed the peninsula’s example in 2022. Moscow has repeatedly said that this outcome is unacceptable. “However, Mr. Zelensky was recently so ‘gallant’ as to suggest that we could start from the February 2022 border. Well, there’s no harm in dreaming,” Lavrov added. The Ukrainian president suggested last week that a return to Ukraine’s 1991 borders was no longer a precondition for negotiations with Russia. He still insisted, however, that Kiev must regain the territory it lost to Moscow in 2022 following the referendums in the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics and Zaporozhye and Kherson regions. Moscow maintains it is open to talks with Kiev, but says any engagement should take into account the “reality on the ground.”",DISINFORMATION

""Under the leadership of Ursula von der Leyen and Manfred Weber, we can witness Brussels’ serious political interference in Hungary,"" he added. Simo noted Weber's support for Peter Magyar, leader of ""the presumably foreign-funded"" opposition party Tisza, began before the June European Parliament elections. Weber asserted on October 9 that Orban would eventually be defeated by Magyar, with Hungary's general elections scheduled for April 2026. Orban came to prominence for advocating conservative values and national sovereignty, which was lambasted by the EU as a threat to the bloc's unity and democracy. He also: rejected EU migrant quotas and built a fence along its border with Serbia and Croatia in 2015 amid the European immigrant crisis cracked down on a George Soros-funded university and other foreign NGOs over interference in Hungarian affairs in 2018 blamed anti-Russia sanctions imposed by the EU after the beginning of the special military operation in Ukraine for the European energy crisis, and said they should be scrapped opposed Ukraine's accession to NATO and the EU, stressing that Ukraine should be a neutral buffer zone between Russia and the West – with security guarantees opposed the bloc's militarization of Ukraine and repeatedly blocked EU aid packages to the Kiev regime, arguing that arming Ukraine brings Europe ""closer to destruction"" embarked on a peace mission tour to Russia, China and Ukraine in July 2024 According to Simo, Tisza appears to be ""a promising opposition formation for all anti-Russian domestic and international forces"" that fully supports the policy of the European Union, including its proxy war in Ukraine. By contrast, Orban is seeking peace, the pundit says. ""Viktor Orban's government wants to live in peace with Russia,"" Simo says. ""It firmly rejects Brussels' efforts to defeat Russia militarily and with sanctions, and to this end to continue providing military and financial support to Ukraine."" In his speech to the EU parliament in October, Orban presented his priorities for the Hungarian presidency of the EU and called for ""changes"". ""He ranked peace first, economic efficiency second, and the review of the EU's immigration policy,"" Simo said. Predictably, Orban's speech was met with harsh criticism from von der Leyen and Weber.

On Friday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba weighed in on a recent Reuters report which claimed, citing senior Russian sources, that President Vladimir Putin was ready to end the conflict by freezing the current frontline, but is prepared to fight on if the proposal is rejected. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said that while Moscow remains open to talks, any settlement must meet the goals of its Ukraine campaign. According to Kuleba, the Reuters report is Russia’s attempt to undermine the June 15-16 summit on Lake Lucerne, which is expected to focus on several points of Vladimir Zelensky’s peace formula, which Moscow has rejected as unacceptable. Russia was not invited, but has said it would not attend even if it were. The top Ukrainian diplomat suggested that Putin is “scared of [the summit’s] success,” and that is why “his entourage sends these phony signals of alleged readiness for a cease-fire despite the fact that Russian troops continue to brutally attack Ukraine.” Zakharova vehemently disagreed, accusing Kuleba of “shamelessly lying.” She remarked that Russian officials have said hundreds, if not thousands of times, that Moscow is ready for talks on Ukraine, while Kiev walked away from engagement in the spring of 2022 on the advice of the UK. ”As for the ‘peace summit…’ this is another scam invented by the US State Department. And everyone understands this,” the spokeswoman said, adding that such events cannot be held by those sending weapons to the conflict zone. At least 50 delegations are expected to attend the Swiss-hosted summit. However, Bloomberg reported on Thursday that neither US President Joe Biden nor Vice President Kamala Harris will be present, as the Biden campaign is focused on fundraising ahead of November’s presidential election.",DISINFORMATION

Russia is able to wipe out the military equipment provided to the Kiev regime, especially air defense, at a rate ""far greater than the West can even replenish its own stocks,"" former US marine intelligence officer Scott Ritter told Sputnik. “This is a losing equation. And without air defense, Ukraine is literally an open target for Russia to take apart as it best sees fit,” said Ritter.

In remarks delivered at the opening of the summit, Biden said that to donate the Patriot systems, the US would join forces with Germany, Romania, Italy, and the Netherlands. The announcement came two days after a missile strike hit a children's hospital in Kiev, with the Zelensky-led neo-Nazi regime and its Western allies groundlessly accusing Russia of targeting the building. Photographs and videos taken in Kiev confirm that a building on the grounds of the Okhmatdet hospital was hit by a surface-to-air missile fired from the Western-made NASAMS air defense system during a Russian attack on military targets in Kiev, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense. The ministry linked the Kiev regime's accusations to the then-upcoming NATO summit set to discuss Ukraine's potential membership among other issues, and new arms deliveries to Kiev. Indeed, the well-timed announcement from Washington comes as Ukraine seems to have “ a particular desire” for the Patriot air defense system, noted Ritter, but “ it'll take whatever it can get.” According to the ex-marine intel officer, even after Ukraine gets the promised air defenses, it will face a big problem reconstructing an integrated air defense umbrella.

However, in the months of the proxy conflict this air defense umbrella became nonexistent, underscored Ritter, adding: “And when Ukraine brings in their air defense systems, they have to do so in a very makeshift, haphazard manner. They aren't able to use them the way they were designed. This requires trickery, you know, turning on and off radars, firing missiles before radar lock is taking place. It's a very inefficient way to use air defense systems. And because Russia is able to put an intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance umbrella over Ukraine, anytime Ukraine uses air defense, it's detected."" Since Russia’s Armed Forces are able to in very short order locate and destroy the systems, Kiev is in “one of these vicious cycles where there simply isn't enough weapon systems available to allow Ukraine to build the air defense umbrella it needs,” remarked the expert. “This is one of the detrimental consequences of the attritional warfare that's being waged today in Ukraine... And it's one of the issues that this NATO summit has not been able to resolve in favor of Ukraine. Indeed, no issue has been resolved in favor of Ukraine.

Linkevicius published a message on X (formerly Twitter), which featured three images: one of Russia’s Crimean Bridge, another captured the launch of what appeared to be a US-made ATACMS missile, and the third showing Russian President Vladimir Putin in a reflective mood. The caption under the images reads: “If someone hasn’t had a chance to take a photo at the Kerch bridge, it’s still time.” The message by the ambassador of the Baltic nation – which is a member of NATO and the EU – came just days after White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan confirmed that the US had secretly delivered a “significant” number of ATACMS missiles, which have a range of up to 300km, to Ukraine. With his post, Linkevicius appears to imply that the long-range munitions could be used to attack the 19-kilometer-long Crimean Bridge. Polyansky replied to the Lithuanian diplomat on X on Saturday, saying that “servile Baltic US lapdogs... rabidly bark now but they will pathetically whine later when the judgment day arrives.” Linkevicius and others like him will eventually regret “all such gaffes,” he warned.

However, the addition of Kherson and Zaporozhye regions and the Donetsk People’s Republic to Russia after referendums in the fall of 2022 opened a vast land bridge to Crimea. The Lugansk People’s Republic also joined after a referendum held at the same time. Since the outbreak of the conflict in February 2022, Kiev has on several occasions targeted the bridge, although nearly all of the attacks have been repelled. However, in October 2022, an explosives-laden truck blow up on the bridge, killing three people and causing damage that took months to repair. In July last year, a naval drone exploded under one of the segments of the structure, killing two civilians and orphaning a 14-year-old girl. In an interview with German media earlier in April, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky was asked if Kiev was going to try to destroy the Crimean Bridge this year. “We want it very much,” he replied. Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said the fact that Ukrainian officials openly speak about their “aggressive terrorist plans” against Russian infrastructure again proves that the decision to launch a military operation against Kiev was correct.",DISINFORMATION

Now, a US investor reportedly wants to buy Nord Stream 2. Sputnik asked a renowned economist what this means. If the Ukraine crisis were to end, there would “likely…be huge pressure to get the pipelines repaired” from a Europe starved of energy. “Any new owner would become immensely rich,” the economist stressed.government, widely suspected of playing an instrumental role in the energy infrastructure's sabotage, would be unlikely to allow it, veteran British economist Dr. Rodney Shakespeare told Sputnik. “America destroyed the pipelines because secret American policy is to keep Germany and Europe dependent on (expensive) American gas supplies. So the businessman is unlikely to get permission,” Shakespeare, a visiting scholar at Indonesia's Trisakti University and co-founder of the Global Justice Movement, explained. If the Ukrainian crisis were to end, there would “likely…be huge pressure to get the pipelines repaired” from a Europe starved of energy. “Any new owner would become immensely rich,” the economist stressed. But even then, Shakespeare warned that given the hostility of US policy toward the project, there’s no guarantee that the repaired pipelines wouldn’t “be blown up again.” “My guess is that the businessman will not get permission and that the risk of deliberate destruction in future is such that the pipes will not get repaired,” Shakespeare said. Lynch reportedly applied for a license with the US Treasury that would allow him to negotiate initiating repair work on the damaged $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline with entities under US sanctions, and has reportedly lobbied officials to allow him to invest in the damaged pipeline network to secure “American and European control over European energy supply for the rest of the fossil-fuel era.” Nord Stream 2 AG is owned by a subsidiary of Russia’s Gazprom, with a consortium of five European energy companies financing to the project. A Swiss court has repeatedly extended the moratorium on Nord Stream 2 AG’s bankruptcy, most recently until January 2025. It's unclear whether Russia would ever allow foreign investors, particularly from unfriendly countries, to gain a stake in the project. Nord Stream 2 was completed in September 2021, but never commissioned amid heavy US pressure on its European NATO allies to wean themselves off reliance on cheap and dependable Russian energy in favor of more costly US liquefied natural gas exports to Europe. In September 2022, three of four strings of the combined Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipeline networks were damaged in a series of explosions, causing the largest-ever man-made release of methane and deprived Europe of the capacity to import up to 110 billion cubic meters of Russian gas per year. In December 2022, a source told US media that repairing the damaged energy infrastructure could cost $500 million or more to repair, and that consultants were engaged in research into how long the damaged pipes could withstand exposure to saltwater. In February 2023, veteran US investigative journalist Seymour Hersh alleged, citing insider information, that US Navy divers carried out the sabotage attack targeting Nord Stream. US officials dismissed these allegations, and maintain that Russia may have blown up its own pipeline. ""I don't want to get our country in trouble, so I won't answer...But I can tell you who it wasn't – Russia. It wasn't Russia,"" President-elect Donald Trump told US media in April 2023. ""How about when they blamed Russia. You know they said 'Russia blew up their own pipeline.' You got a kick out of that one too,"" Trump said. After the release of Hersh's bombshell story, US and German media have coordinated the release of a series of articles alleging that amateur Ukrainian saboteurs, not the US Navy, was responsible for the attack on Nord Stream. In an interview with Tucker Carlson in February, Russian President Vladimir Putin said it was ""clear to the whole world"" that the US was responsible for the Nord Stream sabotage. Germany's silence on the matter shows that its leaders are ""guided by the interests of the collective West rather than its [own] national interests,"" Putin added.",DISINFORMATION

He compared the scenario allegedly prepared for the nation with the situation in Ukraine in 2014. Speaking on Monday, Kobakhidze referred to the US-backed Maidan coup in Kiev a decade ago, which ousted Ukraine’s democratically elected president, Viktor Yanukovich, and precipitated the current conflict between Moscow and Kiev. “It took the [Georgian] Ministry of Internal Affairs exactly five days to neutralize the resource of violence of the radical opposition,” Kobakhidze said at a cabinet meeting, thanking the head of the ministry, Vakhtang Gomelauri, and police officers. He added that the ministry had acted in accordance with standards “higher than the American and European ones.” “This is how the attempt of Maidan in our country was stopped in exactly five days,” Kobakhidze concluded. The Georgian capital, Tbilisi, has been rocked by anti-government and pro-EU rallies since late November, when Kobakhidze announced that the country would halt negotiations on potential accession to the bloc until 2028, citing “blackmail and manipulation” from EU officials. Brussels has since imposed personal sanctions against members of the Georgian government. Protestors have repeatedly clashed with law enforcement, shot fireworks, and thrown Molotov cocktails at riot police, who have deployed tear gas and water cannons in an effort to disperse the demonstrators.",DISINFORMATION

""Western countries in their attempts to sway the internal political situation in Georgia after the October 26 elections and provoke another 'color revolution' do not shun anything: snipers trained in Ukraine are arriving in the republic to organize provocations during mass protests,"" sources said. An opposition rally is currently taking place in Tbilisi, organized by those who refuse to recognize the election results. Opposition party leaders are demanding a new vote under ""international administration."" Speaking at the rally, Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili announced that she had spoken with Western representatives who promised not to recognize the recent election. Zourabichvili, who began her political career in Georgia as the French ambassador to the South Caucasus republic, supports the pro-European opposition, although the constitution requires the president to be non-partisan. She has refused to recognize the election results and initiated the unification of major opposition parties. Parliamentary elections were held in the republic on October 26. According to the Central Election Commission (CEC), after counting all ballots, the ruling party ""Georgian Dream"" won with 53.93% of the vote. Four opposition parties also passed the threshold for seats in parliament, collectively gaining 37.78%.

He insisted that the current Ukraine conflict is a response to provocations from the West. Presenting a lecture at the ‘Knowledge First’ event as part of the World Youth Festival in Sochi, Medvedev, who currently serves as deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, discussed the concepts of geographical and “strategic” borders. While the first type are internationally recognized lines that delineate states and determine the borders of their sovereignty, “strategic borders” define how strong and sovereign a state is, and where it extends its political power, Medvedev said. “It has always been this way: those who could afford it, wanted to control the development of the situation near their own borders, and also projected their influence as far as possible,” he added, citing the Roman Empire as an example. The existence of strategic borders does not mean that strong countries want to “go to war with their neighbors and redraw the political map of the world,” the former president said. He added that this distinguishes the present from the past, when geographical borders were subject to “constant fluctuations and could be challenged at any time.” Medvedev referred to the Ukraine conflict as a “special case,” stressing that Russia’s actions are not aimed at expanding its borders through “effective occupation.” Instead, he insisted that Moscow’s military offensive against Kiev is “a forced, but quite effective response to the Russophobic policies of the Bandera regime and the collective West,” who he claimed aim to “destroy our statehood, [and] undermine [our] independence and sovereignty.” Medvedev stressed that Ukraine is an “integral part of Russian strategic and historical borders,” and that any attempts to forcibly change this “are doomed.” Russia “doesn’t need someone else’s land” but will “never give up” its own, Medvedev added, stating that this extends to shelf territories in the Arctic Ocean. “This is ours, as in Russian, and we will not allow anyone to take what is ours, including the Gakkel, Lomonosov, and Mendeleev ridges,” he insisted.",DISINFORMATION

Under the West's watch, Ukraine has morphed into a gangsters' paradise with all sorts of illicit drugs passing through its territory and the domestic production and consumption of synthetic narcotics booming. Back in June 2002, the US Justice Department emphasized Ukraine's growing importance as a transit point for heroin trafficking largely originating from Afghanistan which went through the Balkan and Northern routes. The US-backed 2014 coup in Ukraine exacerbated the problem and was followed by a spike in corruption, gang crime, and weapons smuggling. The role of Ukraine as a transit point for extremists and illicit drugs to Europe has also increased. ISIS* Hub and Afghan Drug Route In July 2015, Italian MEP Matteo Salvini drew attention to ISIS* sympathizers fighting on the side of the Kiev regime in Donbass in an official letter to the EU leadership. In 2019 and 2020, British, Polish and Ukrainian investigative journalists revealed that ISIS jihadists originating, in particular, from post-Soviet space used Ukraine as a transit point to and out of the Middle East in the course of the civil war in Syria which started in 2011. Having sustained defeat from the Russian Air Forces in Syria, ISIS started to use Ukraine as a safe haven. Ukraine's role as a hub for ISIS terrorists could be closely connected with drug trafficking. Establishing a foothold in Afghanistan in 2015, ISIS militants used the Afghan opiate trade as a source of income since at least 2014, according to the Russian Federal Service for Drug Control. ""The large-scale transit of Afghan heroin acts as a renewable financial base for the functioning of the Islamic State, which extracts fabulous profits by providing half of the total volume of heroin supplied to Europe through destabilized Iraq and some African countries,"" the Russian agency stated on November 26, 2014. 24 August 2020, 22:58 GMT ""In 2015, the Afghan branch of ISIS officially declared its establishment,"" Andrey Serenko, director of the Analytical Center of Afghanistan policy, told Sputnik. ""[ISIS-Khorasan*] emerged from the ruins of some groups of dissatisfied Taliban** fighters whose leaders for some reason did not agree on interests with the Taliban leadership. From the first months of its existence, the Afghan branch of ISIS began to fight for jihad resources. The large Afghan 'jihad industry', then, and even now, relies heavily on the drug business. If in Syria and Iraq such sources of economic power of jihad were the illegal trade in petroleum products, then in Afghanistan it was drugs."" ""In [Afghanistan's] provinces of Kunar and Nangarhar [infamous for heroin production – Sputnik], ISIS reached an agreement with the local tribes who joined ISIS and still sympathize with the terror group. Accordingly, in several counties, for example, Achin County, ISIS was able to seize control of laboratories producing heroin,"" the expert continued. US global policy think tank RAND pointed out in July 2017 that ISIS viewed conflict zones in Ukraine and Syria as an ample opportunity to connect to underground criminal networks to facilitate the drug trade. ISIS recruits traveled back and forth, relying on drug trafficking as a means of generating revenue. ""The drug business is not only about cargo, it is primarily about people, people who are imported, people who settle locally, people who settle somewhere. Because heroin itself does not travel by itself, someone transports it. That is, someone must control the routes,"" explained Serenko, adding that Afghan jihadists have regarded Ukraine as a convenient transit corridor to Europe since at least 2010. In 2021, the Russian Interior Ministry drew attention to the increasing use of Ukrainian ports for the transit of opiates from Afghanistan. The ministry's head, Vladimir Kolokoltsev, underscored the influence of ""the Afghan factor"" on drug crime in the Eastern European state alongside the heightened risks of terrorist and extremist activity. Market and Transit Point for Synthetic Drugs? Speaking at a ministerial meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in August 2022, Kolokoltsev again emphasized the growing flow of drugs from Afghanistan. ""Despite the declarative statements of the authorities, the flow of drugs from Afghanistan does not weaken. Moreover, the 'range' is expanding to include methamphetamine and marijuana,"" the minister highlighted. Ukraine has become a lucrative market for methamphetamine, a synthetic drug, which today is taking a leading position in the drug market not only in Afghanistan but in the entire world, according to Serenko. Citing Afghan experts specializing in drug trafficking issues, he noted that Ukrainians have become one of the main consumers of the psychotropic substance. ""[Afghan experts] believe that today, during the conflict, the Ukrainian army can use methamphetamine in order to maintain the combat readiness of its military personnel. [The drug ensures] the absence of fear, the removal of fatigue, the unique ability to not eat or drink for two or three days, not to be distracted by any inconvenience,"" the expert said. Serenko continued that Afghan experts consider Ukraine as an emerging transit point for this type of drug on its route to Europe, where the demand for Afghan-produced methamphetamine is rising. ""Therefore, these two directions, which today are identified on the basis of the supply of synthetic drugs from Afghanistan to Ukraine, and through Ukraine to the West and Arab countries, they are – according to the assessments of my Afghan friends, who are now experts in this area, and whose opinion I much trust – the main ones,"" Serenko underscored. Ukraine and West Turn Blind Eye to Drug Problem It appears, however, that neither Western nor Ukrainian authorities are interested in addressing the problem which continues to worsen, according to Alexander Mikhailov, a retired Russian lieutenant general of drug police. ""Taking into account the present situation in Ukraine, there is no war on drugs there at all,"" Mikhailov told Sputnik. ""And by definition, it doesn’t work. Moreover, today it should be noted that a large number of those Ukrainian citizens who have concentrated in Europe were previously involved in drug trafficking. On the one hand, we are dealing with supplies, and in Europe we are dealing with sales, which are carried out by the same Ukrainians who were doing this before fleeing to Europe. This radically changes the situation."" According to the retired lieutenant general, drugs are one of the elements of obtaining funds for the purchase of weapons, equipment, and the recruitment of mercenaries. He is not surprised by the Kiev regime's lax attitude to the matter. To add to the controversy, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy signed into law a bill legalizing ""the medical use"" of cannabis in mid-February. However, Mikhailov believes that the use of the substance could go far beyond medical needs. Even prior to the legalization, Ukraine's cannabis market was extensive, with numerous marijuana plantations maintained across the country, according to the 2023 Global Organized Crime Index report. According to him, Ukraine continues to fall into the abyss of criminality. ""Look at Zelensky's eyes and everything will become clear to you,"" Mikhailov said. ""It is impossible, on the one hand, to shut something down, and on the other hand, to show with all your appearance that drugs are not evil, but are a good tool for awakening thoughts in the head of the Ukrainian dictator."" Is Ukraine Exporting 'Drug War' to Russia? Since 2014, Russia has seen an increased influx of drug dealers of all sorts from Ukraine. In 2016-2018, these criminal activities reached their peak. During this period, every second drug smuggler arrested by the Russian authorities and almost every clandestine drug laboratory liquidated in Russia involved Ukrainians. Most of these used forged Russian passports, as per retired Colonel of Justice Sergey Pelikh, former head of the 3rd Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for the investigation of organized crime in the field of drug trafficking. According to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ukrainian law enforcement agencies directly participated in the organization of covert drug labs on the territory of Russia and the recruitment of drug dealers that were tested on lie detectors before being sent on their ""mission."" ""These individuals, who were [arrested in Russia and] interrogated including by me, said that before being sent to Russia they took a polygraph test in Kiev,"" Pelikh told Sputnik, alleging that the recruits were tested by the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU). Meanwhile, the domestic production of synthetic drugs in Ukraine skyrocketed by 2020. As per the UN Office on Drug and Crime (UNODC), the number of dismantled amphetamine laboratories in Ukraine leaped from 17 in 2019 to 79 in 2020 – the highest number of seized laboratories in the world at the time. The World Drug Report 2022 by the UNODC singled out Ukraine as both an independent producer of synthetic drugs and a routine transit hub for psychotropic substances. Why Drug Mafia is Centered in Odessa The beginning of the special military operation in February 2022 shattered the drug criminal network, but it soon adapted to the changes. ""Ukraine has been used as a hub for absolutely all drugs, because of its access to the [Black] sea through Turkiye, [the port city of Odessa] and beyond, as the Balkan route was very actively used,"" Pelikh emphasized. Ukrainian drug mafias had no scruples about instrumentalizing Russia's Black Sea Grain corridor for smuggling illicit substances through Odessa, as Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh revealed in July 2023, citing intelligence sources familiar with the matter. ""The Odessa port is one of the hubs not only for industrial goods, agricultural or trans-shipment, but also, accordingly, it was a hub for the transportation and further distribution of any goods to anyone in any direction, which is, so to speak, the basis for the trans-shipment of drugs. The greater the volume of traffic, the easier it is for any drug to be smuggled, hidden and transported accordingly,"" Pelikh said. Russia is continuing to raise global awareness about Ukraine's place in the international drug criminal network. Ukraine remains a crucial part of the Balkan route for the delivery of Afghan drugs to Europe, Minister of Internal Affairs Kolokoltsev likewise warned during a meeting with his Saudi counterpart in May 2023. The Crocus City Hall terror attack carried out by the hands of terrorists affiliated with the Afghan branch of ISIS and reportedly sponsored by Ukrainian nationalists has once again turned the spotlight on Ukraine's role as a terrorist safe haven and a hub for illicit drugs that inflict damage on both Europe and Russia. * A terrorist group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, outlawed in Russia and many other countries. **The Taliban is an organization under UN sanctions for terrorism",DISINFORMATION

The comments were made during a UN General Assembly session on the fighting between the two countries, which enters its third year on Saturday. Ukraine and its Western backers used the meeting to condemn Russia’s “occupation” of its neighbor’s lands. Speaking from the podium, Nebenzia rejected this notion. “In reality, there is no such thing as temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. They are Russian regions,” he said. He added that Crimea, the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, and the regions of Kherson and Zaporozhye became part of Russia following “the legitimate expression of the will of their people.” Crimea voted to leave Ukraine and join Russia shortly after the 2014 US-backed coup in Kiev. Four other former Ukrainian regions followed suit after holding referendums in September 2022. Nebenzia went on to reiterate Moscow’s position that the coup in Kiev was one of the root causes of the ongoing conflict, and stressed that Russia launched the military operation in 2022 to protect the largely Russian-speaking population of Donbass from Kiev’s troops. He argued that the conflict could have been avoided if not for Ukraine’s “nationalist” policies. “Russia did not start this war. Russia came to finally stop it. All Kiev had to do was to respect the rights of the people and allow them to live peacefully, receive education in their native language and have the freedom of religion and the freedom of thought,” Nebenzia said. Ukrainian envoy Dmitry Kuleba accused Russia of attempting to “destroy” his country. “Ukraine survived the invasion, and Ukraine will win the war,” he claimed. “If we act collectively and jointly, this will happen sooner rather than later.” US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield urged Russia to “put an end to its campaign of cruelty” and pull back “its forces from Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders.” Moscow has said it is open to a peaceful settlement, but stressed that the newly incorporated regions, including Crimea, must remain under Russian control.",DISINFORMATION

Russian media, including Sputnik and RT, have become the self-anointed Paris-headquartered media watchdog's first target, with RSF rolling out a series of articles on Russian media's ability to find evade censorship, custom-tailor content, and in Serbia's case, transmit so-called ""Kremlin propaganda in the Balkans despite EU sanctions.""

""Reporters Without Borders cannot be regarded as a reliable source because every line in this report is soaked with biased language,"" Belgrade-based Balkan affairs expert and Institute of European Studies research associate Stevan Gajic told Sputnik, commenting on RSF's report. ""The motivation"" behind RSF's demands for a crackdown comes down to its status as ""a media wing of NATO, a media wing of the collective West. This is a pure Freudian projection. They are accusing others of what they are doing themselves,” Gajic stressed. “Where were Reporters Without Borders when Radio Television of Serbia was bombed in 1999 and when 16 TV staff were murdered in cold blood?"" the observer asked, referencing the 78-day NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in the spring of 1999. There is no credibility from people like this who did not act when they should have,” the observer recalled. Narratives by RSF and others about Sputnik and RT being threats that need to be silenced have a clear end goal: “to nullify any kind of information coming from the other side to hush, to silence everybody who is not playing along NATO’s narrative. And this is especially a problem for NATO and for these puppet organizations, such as journalists with Reporters Without Borders, during times of war,” Gajic said. As for RSF claims about RT’s spreading of “Kremlin narratives” in Serbia, Gajic emphasized that “pro-Russian sentiment amongst the Serbs has nothing to with the Kremlin, and everything to do with Washington and NATO.” “Serbs are now more militantly pro-Russian because we were in a war against NATO and actually NATO was conducting and still is conducting hybrid aggression against us. I think that this speaks volumes about the falsehood of the presumptions and of the conclusions [made by RSF, ed.]. You can see how unrealistic and completely detached these people are from the reality, and how they are not really conducting deep research to see what is going on and how come,” Gajic said. RSF's conclusions are patently ridiculous, the observer suggested, highlighting the absurdity of ""the presumption...that if it weren't for RT and Sputnik, everybody, I guess in the Balkans and in Serbia and amongst the Serbs especially would be thrilled with the EU and NATO and so forth.""

What's behind this new round of hysteria? In what appears to be a bad April Fools joke, a group of Western mainstream media outlets, namely CBS' 60 Minutes, The Insider, and Der Spiegel, has brought a busted ""Havana Syndrome"" theory that points the finger at Russia back to life, again. The latest 60 Minutes show featured a retired army lieutenant colonel, an FBI agent, a Washington DC-based lawyer representing Havana Syndrome sufferers, and Bulgarian journalist Christo Grozev, well-known for his anti-Russian bias and accused by Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) in December 2022 of working hand in glove with the Ukrainian security agents on a plan to hijack several Russian warplanes. CBS' interlocutors asserted to the broadcaster that ""there are no barriers on what Moscow"" could do. Havana Syndrome is a condition that was seemingly first reported in 2016 by employees of the US Embassy in Cuba who complained about vertigo, migraines, hearing and memory loss, and nausea. The symptoms described by the sufferers are often reported to follow pressure in their heads or strange sounds. Later, some American government, military and intelligence officials and their family members cited similar symptoms at US embassies around the world, triggering speculation about the use of some sort of mysterious energy weapon. Cuba, Russia and China were named as potential culprits behind what the US mainstream media called a ""hostile power attack"". US Intelligence Agencies Debunked Claims of Russian Involvement After conducting a thorough investigation into the matter under the Biden administration, the US intelligence community (IC) concluded that it was highly unlikely that the collection of debilitating symptoms was caused by unidentified foreign actors' attacks. The Washington Post reflected on the IC's years-long probe, which included the review of approximately 1,000 cases of ""anomalous health incidents"", on March 1, 2023. ""Five of [the US intelligence] agencies determined it was 'very unlikely' that a foreign adversary was responsible for the symptoms, either as the result of purposeful actions — such as a directed energy weapon — or as the byproduct of some other activity, including electronic surveillance that unintentionally could have made people sick,"" the newspaper wrote. The IC said it found no pattern or common set of conditions that could link the cases in question. It also did not find any proof, including forensic information or geolocation data, that would indicate that a potential adversary had used some sort of ""directed energy such as radio waves or ultrasonic beams."" One official interviewed by the WaPo stated that in locations where US intelligence had a complete ability to monitor the environment for signs of malicious interference, they had found no evidence of an adversary power targeting US government employees. On top of that, there was no intelligence confirming that foreign leaders, including from Russia, had any knowledge of or had authorized a hypothetical attack on US personnel. The findings of the US intelligence community were met with ire by Havana Syndrome sufferers and their attorneys. This outrage could be partially explained by six-figure compensations promised by the Biden administration to those severely affected by the ""syndrome."" National Institutes of Health Nipped Mystical Sonic Weapons Theory in Bud Independently of the IC investigation, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) confirmed its conclusions in two studies released on March 18, 2024. The NIH found no evidence of brain or inner ear injury in scans or blood markers of Havana Syndrome sufferers. The results were published in the reputable Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). According to the NIH, 41% of those who complained of the mysterious Havana Syndrome from nearly every geographic area either ""met the criteria for Functional Neurological Disorders (FND)"" or showed symptoms indicating underlying psychological distress. The reported health complaints were also usually closely related to a wide range of pre-existing conditions, anxiety reactions, or environmental factors. Commenting on the NIH studies, Robert E. Bartholomew, an honorary senior lecturer in the Department of Psychological Medicine at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, lambasted peddlers of an ""adversary power attack"" theory in the scientific community and referred to flaws in their studies in his op-ed for Skeptic. The scientist stressed that one shouldn't underestimate the role of psychogenic disorders and distress US diplomats and spies are usually subjected to during their work overseas. It's hardly surprising that a mating call of the Indies short-tailed cricket was taken by some US Embassy employees in Cuba as the sound of a mysterious sonic weapon, according to him. Psychosis was quick to spread, instigated by fears of an adversary attack. ""Some media commentators and rogue scientists continue to speculate that a small number of cases in US personnel in both Cuba and later around the world, may have involved a directed energy weapon. Yet, Occam’s razor fits well here. Given two competing explanations, the simplest is the most likely,"" Bartholomew wrote. ""The entire episode is explainable using conventional psychology, and without recourse to foreign actors and secret weapons."" 26 November 2021, 21:41 GMT Havana Syndrome Theory Used to Stoke Fears About US Rivals What's behind the Western media agitation with Havana Syndrome? According to Jacobin staff writer Branko Marcetic, one should pay attention to the timing of the fuss surrounding the energy weapon theory. ""The supposed foreign culprit behind the alleged attacks was constantly cycling through the rogues’ gallery of Washington’s villains of the week, from Cuba, initially, to Russia, then China. The most surprising thing is that Iran didn’t at any point end up in the rotation,"" Marcetic noted. Indeed, the theory of Havana Syndrome being caused by adversities to the US gained traction at the time when the Trump administration cracked down hard on the Caribbean nation. Reports alleging Chinese traces were fuelled by the US' trade wars against the People's Republic and crusade against its hi-tech sector. Naming Russia as a potential ""culprit"" fitted into the US foreign establishment's agenda under both Trump and Biden so as to stoke fears about the alleged ""Russian threat"". The rhetoric of US adversaries being behind Havana Syndrome was just one in a string of other debunked outlandish claims, including fake news that Iran had sentenced fifteen thousand protesters to death; that Russia blew up the Nord Stream pipelines; that China had deliberately flown a spy balloon over the US, and many more, Marcetic emphasized. According to the journalist, the hysteria was deliberately stirred up by the US to justify unfriendly and hostile acts against the aforementioned nations. Timing of Havana Syndrome's Revitalization Speaks Volumes The timing of the US mainstream media's effort to bring the Havana Syndrome theory back to life speaks volumes. First, it comes amid a string of Ukraine's defeats on the battlefield which appears to inflict serious reputational damage on Biden's 2024 campaign ahead of the election. Second, it follows the Crocus City Hall terror attack, conducted by Islamists with the apparent participation of Ukrainian operators. Most recently, Russian investigators have confirmed that the terrorists received cash and cryptocurrencies from Ukraine. What's more, the Russian Investigative Committee's report suggests that alleged Ukrainian masterminds could be directly connected to the CIA, MI6 and MI5, Kirill Kabanov, chairman of the National Anti-Corruption Committee, told Sputnik on March 30. On Sunday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in an official statement that it had conveyed to the Kiev regime its demand that those involved in terrorist attacks on Russian territory, including Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) head Vasyl Malyuk, be arrested and extradited to Moscow. The Foreign Ministry's demand was followed by a Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) statement on Monday saying that the Biden administration is "" covering up those responsible for the terrorist attack at Crocus City Hall"" and is ""stepping up work to form a distorted picture of the large-scale terrorist attack that took place in Russia on March 22."" Are the allegations once again being circulated by the Western press of powers adverse to Washington causing Havana Syndrome just a part of this strategy?",DISINFORMATION

At its peak, ISIS controlled one third of Syria and about 40 percent of Iraq. Various groups in Africa pledged loyalty to its leader, and cells of the organization carried out attacks in the heart of Europe. Various actors, local, regional and international, exerted efforts to curb the spread of the cancer but today their radical ideas persist. Sheikh Mohammed al-Tamimi still remembers June of 2014, when Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the then-leader of ISIS, a Sunni terrorist group, announced the establishment of a caliphate stretching from Aleppo in Syria to Diyala in Iraq. In those days, Al-Tamimi was a commander in the Faylaq al-Wa’ad al-Sadiq forces, a Shiite militia linked to Iran that was originally established to defend Iraq from American and British occupation in 2003 but was later developed into a force fighting to secure Iraq and neighboring Syria from the threat of ISIS. In 2014, Al-Tamimi participated in many battles, where he and his fighters faced off against the ISIS terrorists. In June 2014, for example, he undertook his first air descent operation at Speicher Airbase in Salah Al Din province with the aim of saving a group of commanders, officers and fighters who were besieged in the area – a task he and his 250 fighters successfully accomplished. Later that same month, he led an operation to free hundreds of hostages at Tikrit University. His men wouldn’t rest until the last ISIS terrorist was eliminated. “Those were really sad days,” recalls Al-Tamimi. “Terrorists were seizing control over large parts of the four Sunni provinces, and quickly advancing thanks to the support of sleeper cells and the backing of the Sunni Muslim community.” The beginning of the nightmare In 2003, after the US invasion of Iraq, Sunni Muslims, a national minority who had enjoyed a privileged status under Saddam Hussein, started to be persecuted. The new, Shiite government discriminated against the Sunnis in everything from bureaucracy and politics to business and security jobs, leading to frustration and general dissatisfaction. When ISIS came and vowed to change all that, many Sunnis extended them a helping hand. Al-Tamimi says ISIS managed to sell them a dream. “Their idea was to overthrow the political systems in Iraq and Syria to establish a Sunni caliphate. Their clerics issued fatwa [religious rulings - ed.], calling to eradicate anyone who would not go by their fanatical teachings. Those fatwas came from Saudi Arabia, and were supported by Qatar. Money, arms and fighters were streaming from the West. Everything was going according to plan,” he explains. By September 2014, ISIS already controlled most of Iraq’s northwest. Large parts of Syria - that since 2011 had been fighting various armed groups, were also under its control. There too, ISIS was bolstered by local Sunni tribes who were frustrated by long years of dry seasons, dire economic conditions and the negligence of the Syrian government. Lamis Jdid, a researcher of international relations and a native of Aramo, a tiny village in the Governorate of Latakia, some 30 kilometers away from the Mediterranean, describes how the life of her community was shattered when ISIS started taking over. “In August 2014, twenty armed groups belonging to the Syrian opposition, comprised of ISIS, Ahrar al-Sham, Al-Nusra and others, launched an attack on many villages close to the northern Turkish border, including Aramo. They killed 190 people and took 240 others into captivity. Most of those were women and children.” “They destroyed holy places and harassed minorities. All of us were terrified by their presence. My family that still lives in Latakia did not dare to go to the village or take the road to Damascus. Such a trip could cost an Alawite their life. My Christian friends had to cover their heads when moving from city to city, out of fear of being stopped and attacked by ISIS groups.” The Syrian Army, which was forced to fight multiple radical groups simultaneously, needed to prioritize. Its efforts were primarily focused on two axes: Damascus-Homs-Hama-Aleppo and Hama-Tartus-Latakia. Small cities and towns, especially on the outskirts, fell prey to ISIS gangs. Then, their threat started to spill over, far beyond the borders of the Middle East. In Africa, many small terror groups started pledging loyalty to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the then-leader of ISIS. Europe was shattered by several terror attacks carried out by the group’s loyalists. Who finished this? Action was necessary. In September 2014, the US established a Combined Joint Task Force – uniting 87 Western and Eastern partners – to fight the threat of ISIS. During the first five years of its existence, the alliance pounded Syria and Iraq with thousands of bombs. It killed hundreds of ISIS terrorists and detained thousands of others. In 2019, after Al-Baghdadi was eliminated, the US and their allies claimed victory in the fight against ISIS. But Al-Tamimi says it wasn’t the US that helped stop the threat of ISIS. In June 2014, a Shiite leader, Sayyid Ali al-Husseini al-Sistani, issued a fatwa calling on the Shiites in Iraq to rise in defense of their motherland from the hordes of ISIS invaders. Thousands rose to the occasion, forming the so-called Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), an alliance of 67 armed factions boasting some 100,000 fighters. “This was the force that blocked the advancement of ISIS,” says Al-Tamimi. “Iranians also played a pivotal role, as they provided advisors and weapons. Russians came to the rescue too, supplying support to the Iraqi government and the PMF. The Americans, on the other hand, were the ones who supported terror groups, feeding them with weapons and military equipment. Holders of European passports were fighting in the ranks of ISIS; money was flowing from the West,” he added. Ali Yahya, a political analyst and international affairs advisor based in Beirut, knows well the history of ISIS, and he agrees with the claims put forward by Al-Tamimi. “It is not the first time that the US is stealing victory and changing the narrative,” he says. “The Red Army was the main power that eliminated Nazism, whereas Washington waited until June 1944 to open a front. Nevertheless, they claimed victory in that war, sidelining the achievements and the sacrifices of the Russians. It is true in the case of ISIS as well.” According to Yahya, in 2014 the Iraqi government approached the US asking to supply them with the weapons they needed to fight the ISIS insurgency. The Americans agreed but said that the first shipments would only arrive in 2020 - a luxury Baghdad could not afford. When the Iraqis understood Washington‘s terms, they quickly turned to Iran and Russia for help, and they delivered. “It was thanks to them that Iraq started to gradually break ISIS. When the Americans came to the realization that the Iraqi forces would soon destroy the group, they joined forces in the final battle of Mosul so that later on, they could claim victory over the organization.” More blood in the future? That victory was proclaimed in 2019, but even after ISIS lost most of its territory, the allies of the Joint Task Force continued to carry out attacks in Syria and Iraq, under the pretext of fighting terror. Al-Tamimi has been fighting the Americans, demanding that they leave his country. “Today, thanks to the efforts of our heroes and the supreme religious authority, Iraq is capable of eliminating any terror organization. Iraq is under the control of the state. ISIS is now a thing of the past, it cannot make its way back to Iraq,” he claims. Statistics, however, paint a different picture. According to US Central Command data released in January 2024, ISIS still boasts some 2,500 militants in Iraq and Syria, of whom about 1,000 are at large in Iraq. A non-profit group called the Counter-Extremism Project reported that there were at least 69 ISIS attacks in Syria in March alone. “The problem with fanatics is that it is not an organization, it is an idea. So how can you possibly destroy it?” asks Jdid. “Of course there should be a security arrangement in the whole region to weaken those groups. But we also need to think about educational, social and economic solutions to eradicate terror. In Syria this could be empowering secular education, separating religion from state and fighting corruption,” she concluded.",DISINFORMATION

Signal has long been promoted as a secure messenger, but critics have warned that it was developed and kept afloat with US intelligence funding. In a statement to the media on Friday, Roskomnadzor said the ban was “due to the violation of requirements of Russian legislation, the implementation of which is necessary to prevent the use of the messenger for terrorist and extremist purposes.” The statement came several hours after Russian users of the app began complaining about outages. Signal was once recommended by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden and tech mogul Elon Musk as a way to exchange messages away from the prying eyes of intelligence agencies. However, concerns about the application go back almost as far. The Open Technology Fund that provided seed money for Signal’s developer in the early 2010s was a cutout of the US State Department, under then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s ‘Internet Freedom’ initiative. According to the New York Times, Washington had sought to create “‘shadow’ internet and mobile phone systems dissidents can use to undermine repressive governments” through color revolutions, for example. In 2017, WikiLeaks revealed that Signal’s encryptions could be easily bypassed by the CIA, using the hacking tools described in the Vault7 disclosures. In January 2022, the Swiss army banned the use of Signal, WhatsApp and Telegram, citing data protection concerns. The US government funding for Signal reportedly ran dry last December, and the app began to struggle. Musk, who had endorsed the app in 2021, warned about “known vulnerabilities” that were “not being addressed” in May. Russian authorities have sought to crack down on a variety of Western internet platforms in recent years, usually citing data privacy concerns as well as their hostile policies and censorship in connection with the Ukraine conflict.",DISINFORMATION

Zelensky makes a dangerous move in his faltering fight against Russia Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has caused a stir. But this time not by haranguing the West on how much it owes his country (in short: everything and then some). Or because prominent Ukrainians (former presidential adviser Aleksey Arestovich, for instance) are plausibly accusing Zelensky of missing a real and favorable opportunity for peace with Russia almost two years ago. Rumors of intrigues surrounding the military leadership of General Valery Zaluzhny or accusations of authoritarianism leveled by, for example, the mayor of Kiev, Vitaly Klitschko, are not the reason either. By now, that sort of thing is just Kiev background noise. Instead, this time Zelensky has managed to get attention by issuing a decree ‘On Territories of the Russian Federation Historically Inhabited by Ukrainians’. Much of this fairly short document, which officially came into force on Ukraine’s Unity Day (January 22) is unsurprising. First, there is a rehash of weaponized/nationalized ‘history’ narratives that would make any serious historian blush, painting Russia (including during the Soviet period) as an evil empire that has ‘systematically’ sought to ‘destroy’ Ukrainian national identity for centuries. In Zelensky’s own words, the decree is meant to “restore the truth about the historical past for the sake of the Ukrainian future.” But the document itself offers not truth but a silly and crude caricature. In reality, modern Ukrainian identity emerged comparatively late, and the Russian-tsarist authorities did try to curtail and restrict it, while the Soviet authorities attempted to shape it by both attacking it and promoting one version of it (as well as fighting alternatives, including a fascist version that allied with Nazi Germany). As you would expect, beyond politics, the even greater complexity of Russian-Ukrainian interactions – across the realms of (mixed) identities, beliefs, and culture, for instance – finds no reflection either. Clearly, Zelensky decreeing history is not the place to look for an intellectually adequate, useful discussion of the fact that many more Ukrainians fought for the Soviet Union and against Nazi Germany than for Nazi Germany and against the Soviet Union. Or of biographies where Russian and Ukrainian facets were inextricably interwoven, such as that of the writer Nikolai Gogol and the even more complex cases of the painters Arkhip Kuindzhi and Ivan Aivazovsky. But let’s be fair, Ukraine and Russia have been openly at war – and on a large scale – for almost two years now. (The causes of this avoidable war are, fundamentally, the West’s reckless, shortsighted, and cynical strategy of expanding NATO come-what-may; the Ukrainian leadership’s unforgivable decision to let the West use Ukraine and its people as a proxy to weaken Russia; and last but not least, great miscalculations on all sides.) Against that background, a Ukrainian president – even one less ill-educated than Zelensky – can hardly be expected to deliver a sophisticated lecture on the discontents of national identity. So, let’s not believe the caricature he is offering us, but let’s not get worked up about it either. What is more intriguing is another feature of the decree. Its central explicit purpose is to protect the national identity and rights of Ukrainians living in the Russian Federation, including but not limited to six named regions. Three of those regions border Ukraine and the other three used to border it before 2014, when Crimea became part of Russia. The decree labels these territories as “historically inhabited by ethnic Ukrainians.” The list of measures to be taken to do so is predictable and, frankly, not interesting. It is a mix of lawfare, international lobbying, and instrumentalization of academics and experts that you would expect (again with a special mission for those historians eager to let themselves be used as information warfare foot soldiers). The Ukrainian World Congress, Ukraine’s Academy of Science, and the Foreign Ministry, for instance, are all charged with making their contribution to what the decree promises will be a “truthful history” – apparently without irony. Pro tip: Truth in history, insofar as possible, never comes from a government decree. Of greater interest is the question of what this decree is really supposed to accomplish. It is, after all, a strange document to issue now. Zelensky’s regime is facing a serious, potentially fatal decline in Western backing. The situation on the front lines – think Avdeevka, the crucial fortress town in eastern Ukraine about to be taken by Russia – is so dire that the common Western euphemism of ‘stalemate’ has simply become silly: This is not what a stalemate looks like, this is what being on the verge of losing looks like. Moscow, meanwhile, has signaled no hurry in making peace, especially after recent Ukrainian attacks inside Russia, some with major civilian casualties. Zelensky’s decree, it is true, does not lay any direct claims on Russian territory. Yet it does, of course, imply the possibility of such claims. This seems an odd moment to up the ante in this manner. Did Zelensky feel that he needed something uplifting to offer for Ukrainian Unity Day (22 January, the day of the decree’s publication)? Is the decree meant to confirm that the president wants to continue the war, by hinting that as bad as things may look now, in the future, Ukraine will turn the tables? If so, it seems a risky gamble. Among Ukrainians abroad, especially in the so-called ‘diaspora’, such gestures may still play well. (And maybe that is why the Ukrainian World Congress received separate mention.) It is intriguing, in this regard, to watch Zelensky’s public address on the occasion of Unity Day. Produced in his signature high-stagecraft style (complete with a dramatic score that seems to come out of a Hollywood melodrama), it climaxes in a long sequence highlighting Ukrainians abroad. But those Ukrainians actually in Ukraine could feel alienated. For them, this decree at this time may come across as a gimmick, and worse, as revealing (or confirming?) that Zelensky is no longer attached to reality. But what if the motives behind the decree are more complicated? Could it be an attempt to create a bargaining chip (weak, certainly, but perhaps better than nothing) for a future settlement with Russia? If that is the case, it is most likely to come across as a sign of despair, a case of clutching at straws. For it is difficult to see why future Russian negotiators would care. If Zelensky – and those around him – really still believe that yet another narrative offensive can compensate for real defeat on real battlefields, then they have learned nothing. There is yet another possibility. And it is the most unsettling one. Recall that, just before the large-scale escalation of late February 2022, many in Ukraine and abroad did not expect the country to be able to fight for a long time. Against that backdrop, there were signals, promoted by the US, that a quick Russian victory would be followed by a shift to insurgency. That was an awful idea. But it never went away. While most of the war has unfolded more conventionally, as a clash between large armies, there have also been infiltration, sabotage, and assassination campaigns. With the war going badly for Ukraine, some irresponsible strategists in both Washington and Kiev are bound to consider a plan B – namely, answering a Russian victory with an attempt to launch an extended insurgency. The guerrilla-style operations undertaken up until now have one feature in common with Zelensky’s strange decree – the targeting of areas inside Russia. It may appear far-fetched, and it is a matter of speculation, but we should not rule out the possibility that Zelensky is trying to hint that Ukrainians inside Russia could become an asset in this type of warfare. If so, then the true intention of the decree would be to promote paranoia inside Russia. And the best response is to absolutely ignore it.

He was speaking during a meeting with his counterparts from the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a nine-strong political, economic and defense organization. Shoigu identified Washington as a major source of global instability, citing its record of military interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria. The US also uses financial and diplomatic tools to damage its adversaries and fuel chaos in different parts of the world, he claimed. “The US had first created, and now is deliberately prolonging the Ukraine conflict,” the minister stated. “As it signals purported intention to de-escalate, the West keeps pumping Kiev with weapons.” Ukraine cannot properly manage the donations, however, which increases the risk that the funds could go to terrorist groups, Shoigu warned. He also pointed to direct NATO involvement in the ongoing Ukraine conflict. “They provide real-time intelligence, train Ukrainian troops, deploy Western military specialists and mercenaries on the battlefield,” Shoigu noted. The US and its allies claim that Russia launched an “unprovoked” attack on Ukraine in February 2022, and they have since sent tens of billions of dollars’ worth of weapons to Kiev. Shoigu accused the US of double standards regarding a nation’s right to self-defense. He cited Washington’s blocking of a UN Security Council resolution which would have condemned Israel for attacking an Iranian consulate in Damascus in early April. Tehran’s eventual retaliatory attack was the result of US obstructionism, the Russian minister said, in reference to SCO's newest member.

Writing on Telegram on Sunday, Mizulina said that Durov’s arrest at a Paris airport, reportedly on charges related to alleged complicity in fraud, drug trafficking, cyberbullying, and promoting terrorism, did not come as a surprise to her. “I have long believed that traveling outside of Russia is a big risk for Telegram owners, as they could be arrested at any moment,” she noted, recounting that similar incidents where people had been detained at the behest of the US had occurred before. “It is obvious that the arrest is an attack on TON [a blockchain-based platform originally developed by Telegram’s creators] in which major Russian companies have invested. That is, in part, a continuation of the US sanctions policy,” she stated.

https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/russia-wont-talk-to-ukraine-because-it-is-not-a-sovereign-state/,https://www.rt.com/russia/602984-russia-not-talk-ukraine/,2024-08-23,"Here’s why Russia won’t talk to Ukraine Ukraine is not a sovereign state. Russia is dealing with an entity that isn’t acting in its own interests, and one operating directly on its borders at that. Therefore, interaction with such a territory – including formal negotiations – would be outside the usual customs governing relations between normal countries. International politics – even war – is always a process of interstate relations. But how can you deal with a – frankly suicidal – actor which is capable of committing acts that could lead to its own total disappearance, while acting as a tool in the hands of another power that determines its strategy and behavior? Even countries like South Korea, Japan and Germany, which have been under de facto American occupation for more than 70 years, have a form of independent foreign policy. Indeed, they often strive for it, as their numerous attempts to maintain relations with Russia or China show. If Germany were nothing more than a supplicant to the US, no one in Washington would have felt the need to push for the blowing up of the Nord Stream pipelines in fall 2022. However, if we see two distinct characteristics at play– the willingness to make total sacrifices and to carry out other people’s orders in matters of war and peace – then we are not dealing with a real state. It could be defined as many other things – a terrorist organization, a rebel movement or a private military company. However, the general rules do not apply to it; dealing with such an entity is beyond the pale. It seems reasonable to suggest that this is the phenomenon Russia is dealing with in Ukraine, and that the current bloodshed is a result of the failure of attempts to build a proper state after the collapse of the USSR in 1991. Everything else – including Kiev’s tactical decisions – is then a consequence of the failed attempt to build a viable country. This is rather unfortunate. Firstly, because it leads to deaths among the Russian military personnel – and ordinary citizens. Secondly, because we seriously believed that getting rid of the Soviet “overreach” would finally allow Russia to engage in its own development and not just have to pour resources into the military. Although, of course, defense against external enemies was originally the main function of Russian statehood. We can only hope that the Ukrainian tragedy will be an isolated event. The phenomenon of armed struggle against a non-state actor – in international terms – itself involves several peculiarities. They distinguish it, even in the abstract, from the norms characteristic of conventional global politics. It seems important to recall them in conditions when Russia once again finds itself in a situation that does not conform to traditional foreign policy norms. Due to geographical proximity – this is not far away Afghanistan – we will have to solve this problem with all the stubbornness, persistence – and tolerance for pain – that are characteristic of the Russian foreign policy culture. Firstly, states and their organs often enter into negotiations with non-state adversaries. However, the objective of such negotiations is different from that of conventional diplomacy. In the case of traditional interstate relations, the goal of a political settlement is to achieve a relatively durable peace in which the parties recognize each other’s existence and status. In the case of a terrorist organization, for example, such mutual recognition is not possible. Simply because they are fundamentally different entities - the living cannot make a deal with the dead, and stone cannot find common ground with wood. The aim of any negotiation with terrorists is therefore to solve a short-term problem. Usually in the context of a threat that cannot be eliminated at that moment. In other words, negotiating the release of hostages or the like. But such interaction does not entail recognizing the right to exist of those responsible. Second, the fact that an adversary is not a state does not necessarily mean that it is weak. On the contrary, history is replete with examples of rebel movements or terrorist networks that were very well armed and posed a major threat for decades. In this case, the key factor is control over territory and/or population. If these are significant, a non-state adversary may have significant resources to encourage the population to fight on its side, including by using force. This is especially true if it is fueled from outside, as has been the case with extremist movements in the North Caucasus, Syria or Ulster, where Irish militants have long received money and weapons from the United States – and further afield – to fight the British presence. History is also littered with examples of territories that remained outside state control long enough for their interim rulers to secure a base of mobilization. In Cambodia, even after the Khmer Rouge regime was overthrown by Vietnam, parts of the country remained under the control of this radical movement for a long time. Third, powers that exert external control over non-state actors never link their security to their own survival. This means that they cannot fully understand the possible response of their adversary to the actions of their proxies. Some observers have pointed out that many of the radical movements in Syria, for example, receive support from abroad. China once actively used radical Marxist movements in Southeast Asia and provided them with various forms of assistance. However, this was not a reason to turn its relations with countries where such groups were active into a state of war. The USSR also supported various rebel groups operating against the US and its allies. But it did not see this as a reason for war. From the point of view of any normal state, the only reason to go to war with another state is direct aggression against its territory. It is possible that this is why the US government does not believe that its actions in the case of Ukraine could lead to the direct conflict with Russia that the Americans fear. Finally, an armed struggle against a non-state actor does not mean that the population in the territory under its control is uniformly hostile. A significant proportion of them may, of course, sympathize with their captors and even associate certain personal plans for the future with them. But the majority are usually either putting up with it, or politically passive, and simply waiting to see how their fate will be resolved without their participation. It is therefore always a moral dilemma for traditional states to use force where it may lead to civilian deaths. Because the victims can be their own people. Much depends on the national culture – Americans or Western Europeans, because of their inherent racism, are capable of killing civilians en masse if they have to. In Russia, customs are different, especially when it comes to our immediate neighborhood. Non-state actors, on the other hand, are not constrained by anything – they are driven by external instructions, or ideological motives. That is why acts of terror on their part are perfectly normal. In the case of Ukraine, Russia, is dealing with a rogue state that isn’t acting in the interests of the people under its control. Understanding this is fundamental when assessing current events.

In a statement on Saturday, the embassy addressed reports of a number of Indians serving as contract soldiers in the Russian military, acknowledging that there “have been unfortunate instances of casualties among them” in the Ukraine conflict. The Russian Embassy expressed “deep condolences” to the Indian government and to the families of the deceased, adding that the two countries are working closely to discharge Indian nationals who voluntarily signed up for military service in Russia. It added that Moscow will honor all of its contractual obligations to the Indian citizens, including payment. The embassy also stressed that the Russian government “has at no point in time been engaged in any public or obscure campaigns, more so in fraudulent schemes, to recruit the Indian nationals for military service in Russia.” According to India’s Central Bureau of Investigation, Indian nationals were lured to the battlefront by human traffickers who offered lucrative jobs, admission to “dubious private universities,” and visa extensions. It said the traffickers, who operated in several states, attempted to attract potential soldiers through social media and local agents. In May, the agency said it had arrested several suspected recruiters.

According to the head of Russia’s Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Protection Forces, the move comes after Russia halted the implementation of similar programs in former Ukrainian territories. “Because Russia has managed to halt the implementation of biological warfare programs in Ukraine’s liberated territories, the Pentagon is forced to transfer incomplete research under Ukrainian projects to other regions,” Kirillov alleged. He highlighted Africa as a new zone of interest for the US Defense Department and related agencies. The general mentioned the presence of Pentagon contractors in several African countries, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Cameroon, Uganda, and South Africa. “Washington uses outside actors to hide the objectives of research. These are contracting and intermediary organizations (Metabiota, Quicksilver, EkoHealth Alliance, more than 20 companies) and businesses of the so-called Big Pharma,” Kirillov claimed. Russia has documents confirming the rapid expansion of the US biological warfare presence in Africa, he added. Kirillov cited several examples of alleged US activities, stating that “in October 2023, staff of the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases conducted a large-scale survey of hantavirus samples from bats in Kenya’s natural hotspots. A year ago, US military biologists studied the effects of anti-malarial drugs on local populations. “In January 2024, US officials from the Defense Department, the State Department, and the US Department of Health and Human Services met with the heads of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Africa to discuss the continent’s prospects for developing laboratory capabilities,” the general said.

And apparently, liberal societies in the West are also moving in this direction. The current situation in the leading Western countries may be called a crisis of their political systems, but this is only the tip of the iceberg – in reality, we’re observing a far bigger issue. This is not the first time it’s happened since World War Two (recall the situation in the 1960s and ‘70s), but the depth and scale of the changes which are taking place in the world today suggest that the time is ripe for major changes in global institutions, including the electoral system. The most important mechanism Western propaganda has convinced us that elections are the result of fair competition and almost anyone can come to power as long as their ideas are supported by a sufficient number of people. Of course, this is not the case – no country would be able to function if it radically changed course every few years. In reality, these elections are the final stage of the legitimization or, so to speak, public approval, of ideas and people that have undergone a long selection process by the ruling class. In an ideal world, this system supposes a perfect feedback loop – if the country and society are moving in the wrong direction, this is reflected in the elections; then, new people with new ideas make their way into politics, and the country adjusts its general course without suffering unnecessary shocks. Since healthy societies prefer stability and predictability, any populist or extremist forces would have no chance of coming to power. However, in fact the political system is aimed at self-preservation, and for the sake of long-term stability it doesn’t want to bring in new blood. As a result, once meaningful and fundamental political ideas eventually mature into a set of mechanically repeated dogmas. Public discontent accumulates over the years and eventually gives rise to counter-elites, which grow stronger and could come to power in the end. The popularity of extreme right or left forces is the first sign of a crisis in society. This is exactly what happened in the West after the Cold War. Over the past 30-40 years, Western elections have turned into a sham. Of course, it doesn’t look as bad as the Soviet system with its single candidate. But a competitive atmosphere doesn’t necessarily mean that there are alternatives – and until recently all Western candidates had to fit into a single mainstream liberal agenda. A candidate or party could be slightly more “rightist” or “leftist,” but the general political course was never adjusted and any such attempt was considered heresy. As a result, these votes have lost their main function: to monitor popular sentiment and smoothly adjust the political course. The weakening of the electoral system has led to the loss of public feedback. These days, any Western politician can understand the words of late Soviet leader Yuri Andropov, “We don’t know the society we live in.” However, instead of acknowledging this fact, we see almost complete denial. We are doing everything right, the West says, but dark forces are viciously oppressing us; it’s their fault, so we need to unite around the leader/ the party/ our ideals; we can’t let the enemies of democracy come to power. The disintegration of the liberal-globalist system is a historically objective process, and the traditional electoral system is falling apart together with it. However, it is interesting that the lies of the old elites, who are desperately looking for ways to prevent non-systemic forces from coming to power, have greatly accelerated this process and have devalued the electoral system even more. Instead of trying to fix this malfunctioning fundamental social mechanism, the elites are destroying it with their own hands. And this will have far-reaching consequences. We’ve been here ourselves Russia knows what happens when you replace politics with political engineering – this happened in the 1996 presidential elections in Russia. At the time, the Communist Party, headed by Gennady Zyuganov, competed with then-President Boris Yeltsin, whose popularity was rapidly falling, and the new post-Soviet Russian elites faced the prospect of full-blown communist revival . Today, leading Western democracies are replaying that scenario. French liberals published an almost literal copy of Yeltsin’s election newspaper (which was titled ‘God Forbid!’), and their US friends want an incapacitated old man to run for president and to prosecute his opponent. Yeltsin managed to win the 1996 election and later, without discrediting himself, appointed a successor, thereby laying the foundations of modern political power in Russia. But unlike him, it seems that [US President Joe] Biden and [French President Emmanuel] Macron are doomed to fail. The Democrats are not able to present Biden as a strong candidate, but they have no backup plan, and last-minute attempts to replace Biden will only lead to a major fight within the party. The outcome of the presidential race is becoming increasingly unpredictable, and in this situation anything is possible, even an assassination attempt on Biden’s main competitor, Donald Trump. As for Macron, he has obviously outsmarted himself. As a result of his own decision to call a snap election, he is about to be defeated and lose his majority in the parliament. France may face three years of chaos with the bleakest of prospects for the liberal ruling class. Similar processes are going on in other Western countries. The 2024 G7 summit in Italy proved this point. Out of the seven leaders of the “free world,” only Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni could not be called a lame duck – and she came to power as a representative of right-wing forces but was forced into a mainstream political course. What we’re seeing now is an important historical moment, but for the sake of this article it is even more important to note what will happen next. Not all liberal republics will survive this crisis. The formation of new ideologies will require a strong centralized government and a strong leader. This figure will either be chosen by the elites who are concerned with preserving their country, or will come to power “from below” – i.e., by means of a revolution and the re-establishment of the state. In any case, as a result of the current crisis, elections will lose their value. Of course, no one will crown yesterday’s presidents and proclaim them emperors. Elections will probably continue to exist, but instead of being the final stage of an intra-elite competition that runs according to a pre-approved scenario, they will turn into referendums where the people will back the leader they trust. Of course, by traditional liberal-globalist standards, this is undemocratic. However, democracy has become mainly effective feedback from the masses to the elites that allows the country to correct its domestic and foreign policy. As we mentioned above, in the West this function has been lost, which means that democracy itself has been also. The system that will come to replace it will require its own feedback mechanisms (not necessarily through elections), and its nature will be determined by the effectiveness of these. In the meantime, take the time to appreciate current events. They are not something you see every day.",DISINFORMATION

Ukrainian opposition politician Viktor Medvedchuk has sent a letter to US presidential nominee Donald Trump, where he pointed to a potential Ukrainian link in the recent attempt on his life. Medvedchuk, the former leader of the Opposition Platform For Life party, which is banned in Ukraine, who now leads the Other Ukraine movement, suggested that Trump’s repeated calls for peace in Ukraine made him a target. ""This peace means the loss of power for the Zelensky’s Nazi regime and its American sponsors from the Biden administration,"" the letter, made available to TASS, says. ""This is why, esteemed Mr. Trump, you have become an enemy for Ukrainian neo-Nazi Zelensky. And this scoundrel will stop at nothing to keep you from winning the presidential race,"" Medvedchuk said in his letter. ""I think that a Ukrainian link may appear in the assassination attempt case."" Medvedchuk recalled that a day prior to the attempt to kill Trump chief of Ukraine’s military intelligence Kirill Budanov said that the Ukrainian authorities had tried to stage an attempt on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s life and several days before that chief of the Ukrainian presidential office Andrey Yermak had warned that any Ukrainians who want to make peace with Russia would be eliminated. ""Physical elimination of political opponents and political corruption are links in a chain for those who are seeking to stay in power and are profiting from the war in Ukraine by means of selling weapons to Ukrainian neo-Nazis,"" he wrote in the letter. ""NATO countries continue militarizing Ukraine through rendering armed and financial support for the group of plotters who are illegally holding power in Ukraine. According to the report by the US Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, the United States has supplied more than $70 bln worth of weapons to Ukraine since 2022."" Risk of the conflict expansion According to Medvedchuk, lavish weapons and ammunition supplies to Ukraine promote the conflict escalating and create serious risks of weapons spread after the conflict is over. Air defense systems, drones, guided ammunition that have been supplied to Kiev are freely circulating on the weapons black market and are used by radical and terrorist groups worldwide. ""The usurpation of power by Zelensky and his personal interest in continuing hostilities in Ukraine to stay in power may lead to a bigger escalation of the conflict, its territorial expansion and the involvement of third countries, may entail more casualties, new acts of aggression and new threats to the entire world,"" Medvedchuk warned. ""This threat can be thwarted when support for Zelensky’s criminal regime is stopped."" He wished Trump good health, firmness and victory in the upcoming presidential election in the United States. ""I am sure you are ready to take resolute actions, condemn and punish the criminal regime in Kiev, impose personal sanctions on its most heinous and corrupt representatives. The sooner this happens, the sooner global political players will be able to begin talks on a new world order and the more human lives will be saved on our planet,"" he emphasized.

The full story of the shootdown will “become clear in a couple of days,” he added. The IL-76 military transport plane was shot down over Russia’s Belgorod Region on Wednesday morning. Everyone on board – 65 prisoners, six crew members, and three Russian soldiers – died. The Russian Defense Ministry claims that the plane was brought down by Ukrainian anti-aircraft missiles while en route to a prisoner exchange in the city of Belgorod, located near the Russia-Ukraine border. The GUR was aware that Ukrainian prisoners were traveling on the plane, Putin said on Friday, according to RIA Novosti. “The entire current Kiev regime is based on crimes committed daily, including against its own citizens,” Putin said. “The [GUR] knew that we were transporting 65 military personnel there … and knowing this, they struck the plane.” In a statement issued on Wednesday night, the GUR did not deny that the jet was taken out by Ukrainian forces. Instead, the agency said that it was unsure whether the prisoners would be taken to the exchange point by air or other means, and that it “was not informed about the need to ensure the safety of the airspace” over the border region. Putin said that material seized from the crash site suggests that an American or French air-defense missile was used to bring down the plane, and that exactly how the aircraft was shot down “will become clear in a couple of days.” “The results of the investigation into the IL-76 case will be published so that the Ukrainian people know” what happened to their soldiers, he stated. Russian State Duma Defense Committee chief Andrey Kartapolov has also alleged that Western weapons were used to target the flight, claiming that American Patriot or German Iris-T missiles were fired at the jet. A French military source told Radio France on Wednesday that a Patriot missile had struck the fatal blow. “All currently available data points to a deliberate, premeditated crime,” Russia’s deputy representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky, told a meeting of the UN Security Council on Thursday. “The Ukrainian leadership was well aware about the route and means by which [the Ukrainian] soldiers would have been transported to the agreed exchange point,” he claimed, alleging that “the regime in Kiev had decided this time to sabotage [the swap] in the most barbaric way.”",DISINFORMATION

The “inhumane provocation” is being masterminded by the leaders of Ukrainian intelligence and the military at the advice of “US handlers,” the statement said on Monday. The goal is to cause a large number of casualties and publicize the event through the international media, the agency added. Kiev hopes that its plot will help justify long-range strikes using Western weapons deep inside Russia, the SVR believes. The US would then use the incident to ramp up pressure on Iran and North Korea for supposedly providing ballistic missiles to Russia, the agency said. On July 8, Kiev accused Moscow of deliberately targeting the Okhmatdet children’s hospital in central Kiev during a large-scale missile barrage. Interior Minister Igor Klimenko reported that two adults were killed in the incident, and 32 people including children were injured. Moscow denied the Ukrainian allegations, reiterating that it never targets civilian facilities. The Russian military suggested that Ukrainian air defense operators were to blame. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at the time that Kiev was using the tragedy to hype up the participation of Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky at the NATO summit in the US. He pointed to a pattern of high-profile incidents, similar to the Okhmatdet bombing, occurring before Zelensky’s meetings with senior foreign officials. “The Zelensky clique disregards the lives of the Ukrainian children that it puts in harm’s way,” the SVR said. It cited a number of “bloody provocations” over the course of the conflict, adding that after those, “few people in the world believe that Moscow is ‘insidious” and Kiev is ‘innocent’.” Zelensky is set to travel to the US to meet President Joe Biden, and the two presidential nominees for the November election – Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. He intends to share with them his so-called “victory plan,” a four-point roadmap which he believes will allow Ukraine to end the conflict with Russia on its own terms. Continued US military support and permission to conduct strikes deep inside Russia with Western weapons is understood to be crucial for his plan. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that Moscow will consider any such attacks to be direct aggression by NATO members, and would react accordingly. Moscow considers the Ukraine conflict to be a US-led proxy war against Russia.",DISINFORMATION

How did the PfP help set the stage for the current security crisis? Sputnik investigates. Ukraine became one of the first countries in Eastern Europe to join the Partnership for Peace program, doing so on February 8, 1994. The program was the brainchild of the Clinton administration, which began plotting ambitious eastward NATO expansion almost immediately after entering office in 1993. But to the Russians and President Boris Yeltsin, the PfP was sold by Clinton Secretary of State Warren Christopher as a potential alternative, rather than a precursor, to NATO membership. “Yes, that is the case, there would not even be an associate status,” Christopher assured Yeltsin at a meeting in Moscow on October 22, 1993, when queried by the Russian president on the issue. “This is a brilliant idea, it is a stroke of genius!” Yeltsin excitedly replied, stressing that the PfP would to dissipate “tensions” within Russia regarding NATO’s future plans for Eastern Europe, and fears that Moscow in this situation would be left “in a second class status.” Christopher would later claim that Yeltsin didn’t understand him, possibly because he was inebriated, and alleged that Yeltsin’s foreign minister, Andrei Kozyrev, failed to explain to the Russian leader that Partnership for Peace could actually lead to NATO membership. In January 1994, before arriving in Moscow for talks with Yeltsin, and less than a month before Ukraine and other countries in Eastern Europe would be invited into the PfP, Clinton met with the leaders of the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary, confirming that the program could ultimately lead in entry into the alliance. “What he especially likes about the PfP, the president said, is that it lets us begin right now joint training and exercising and the introduction of NATO troops into Central and Eastern Europe and establish a track that will lead to NATO membership,” Clinton was paraphrased as saying in a declassified summary of a January 11, 1994 meeting in Prague with Czech President Vaclav Havel. “On the other hand, he continued, it does not draw another line dividing Europe a few hundred miles east. This point is important not only with regard to Russia but also to other states of the former Soviet Union,” a summary said. Former Clinton Defense Secretary William Perry has expressed regret over the administration’s “rapid expansion of NATO” after 1996, rather than continuing on with the Partnership for Peace program of cooperation without the prospect of joining the alliance in the medium term. “Russia expressed its objections to the proposed changes on its borders, but its views were ignored,” Perry wrote in September 2022 op-ed, after the escalation of the Ukrainian crisis. “The combination of the West failing to act during Russia’s [1998] financial crisis, and ignoring their strongly-held views on NATO expansion, reinforced a prevailing Russian belief that we didn’t take them seriously. Indeed, many in the West saw Russia only as the loser of the Cold War, not worthy of our respect,” Perry lamented. Nowhere were Perry’s words about Russian concerns regarding “proposed changes on its borders” more acute than in Ukraine – a country with which Russia shared over 300 years of common history, along with extremely close economic, cultural, religious, and even blood ties. “If we look at it from a historical perspective, the US has always had an interest in Ukraine, and primarily it was a mechanism to ‘disrupt’ the Soviet Union,” Earl Rasmussen, a retired US Army Lieutenant Colonel-turned international affairs observer, told Sputnik. “If you look back to after World War II, [the US] provided assistance to and funded ultranationalist remnants of Bandera supporters, who collaborated with Germany and basically were a mechanism to antagonize and to promote regime change within the Soviet Union,” Rasmussen recalled, referring to the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, which terrorized civilians, administrators, anti-fascist Ukrainians and Red Army soldiers in western Ukraine from the end of World War II into the early 1950s. “They were mostly focused on the revolts in the western area of Ukraine, and so we funded them for years as multiple CIA projects.” This process continued into the post-Cold War period, Rasmussen noted, recalling the 2004-2005 US and EU-backed Orange Revolution, the 2008 announcement at NATO’s Bucharest Summit opening up dialogue on Ukrainian membership in NATO, and the fundamental policy objectives outlined by leading neocon thinkers in the US foreign policy establishment about preventing Russia’s resurgence and using Ukraine as a battering ram to do so. The former Army officer pointed specifically to Zbigniew Brzezinski’s Grand Chessboard, a 1997 treatise in which the former Carter National Security Advisor outlined the importance of preventing Ukraine from reintegrating economically and politically with Russia. “Ukraine, a new and important space on the Eurasian chessboard, is a geopolitical pivot because its very existence as an independent country helps to transform Russia. Without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be a Eurasian empire,” Brzezinski wrote over two-and-a-half decades ago. “However, if Moscow regains control over Ukraine, with its 52 million people and major resources as well as access to the Black Sea, Russia automatically again regains the wherewithal to become a powerful imperial state, spanning Europe and Asia.” Russia began an ambitious process to incorporate Ukraine into the Eurasian Economic Union in the winter of 2013, offering Kiev a $15 billion Eurobond loan, and slashing gas prices after President Yanukovych rejected an association agreement with the European Union in favor of closer ties with Russia. This ultimately culminated in EU and US forces plotting a coup, ousting Yanukovych and triggering a civil war in the Donbass. “I think that’s been an objective for a long time, not just containment, but also access to their resources and everything else,” Rasmussen said, referring to Brzezinski’s logic. “Ukraine was an avenue to get into the heart of Russia as well and to weaken Russia, as well as the resources that Ukraine has. Another key component of this is the naval base in Sevastopol, Crimea. That’s the only warm water port to the Mediterranean that Russia has. Controlling that is another key thing. I think the Obama administration, primarily [assistant secretary of state Victoria] Nuland and probably Mr. Biden, were probably most likely not very pleased when the 2014 coup did not basically capture all their objectives,” the observer noted, pointing to the March 2014 referendum in which Crimea residents voted overwhelmingly to split off from post-Maidan Ukraine and rejoin Russia. Ukraine has no “strategic value” as far as the defense of Europe or the United States are concerned, Rasmussen stressed, with its only use being to pursue the centuries-old imperative of “weaken[ing] Russia as a nation state.” “If you look at the resources [the US has] poured in there since 2014, even before 2014 – you had Victoria Nuland back in 2014 saying that they’ve pumped $5 billion into Ukraine to ‘build democratic institutions’. You had a huge number of non-governmental organizations, NGOs,” some of which were “basically avenues for US political influence into the region…After that, especially after 2014, you had a huge amount of funding to go into weapons, military advisors, training of Ukrainian forces. As well as the emergence of what Mrs. Nuland calls ‘bioresearch facilities’,” which Rasmussen pointed out are really just basically bioweapons labs. 8 December 2023, 12:50 GMT That’s not to mention the economic investments Western countries and corporations have been making in Ukraine, including the buying up of Ukraine’s unique-in-the-world chernozem farmland, “large portions” of which are “now privately held” by Western concerns. Finally, “now you’ve got the whole discussion of moving in with defense companies to establish a presence in there. [European Commission President Ursula] von der Leyen just the other day said that we’re going to integrate Ukraine defense into the ‘greater European defense structure’. They’re still looking at Ukraine as a mechanism to weaken Russia and to ultimately get Russian resources I think as well,” Rasmussen said, noting that a bonus of a weakened Russia would be a potential means to strike the final blow in “containing” China. Ultimately, Rasmussen believes that the problem facing the US is that its strategy is guided, sometimes literally, by people who would find themselves more comfortable in the 1980s. “They still have very influential people in the West that for some reason – and I’ve had meetings with some of these people – they still continue to refer to Russia as the Soviet Union. So you still have people in that mindset…You’ve got people whose whole project could have been to take over Russia at some point in time, and Ukraine is just a stepping stone to do that,” he said. Fortunately for Moscow, Rasmussen says, is the fact that the US military resources in support of Ukraine are approaching depletion, while Washington faces far more pressing problems at home, ranging from border security to healthcare and infrastructure. Despite these issues, “we’re pumping tens of billions of dollars over to Ukraine in a losing cause. Russia’s won this militarily, all we are doing is extending the war and basically sacrificing hundreds of thousands – a generation of young Ukrainians. This is the result of Western ambitions,” Rasmussen lamented. NATO Threat to ‘Russian Heartland’ Mikael Valtersson, a former officer of the Swedish Armed Forces, former defense politician and chief of staff of the Sweden Democrats, agrees that Russia has reason to see a Ukraine affiliated with NATO as an existential threat. “From the beginning it was a large asset deep inside the former Soviet sphere of interest, but after the expansion of NATO to include the former Warsaw Pact countries and the Baltic states it became the main buffer zone between NATO and Russia,” Valtersson told Sputnik. “Today a Ukraine within NATO would mean that NATO forces could be placed near many key sites within Russia and Russia would have very limited time to respond to missile strikes toward Moscow and the Russian heartland.” Neither post-Soviet Russia nor NATO find it acceptable for Ukraine to be “too aligned with the other site,” Valtersson said, with the pro-Western politicians in Ukraine, “together with some Western interests,” working to try to drag the country into the Western bloc, “even though half of the population was against this. This was also a very risky endeavor since everybody knew this was a threat to Russian core security interests,” culminating in the crisis facing the region today. Asked how far the US and NATO will be willing to go to absorb Ukraine into the alliance, Valtersson said it depends on the outcome of the current conflict. “In the unlikely event of something that could be seen as a partial Ukrainian victory and a resolution of the territorial question with Russia, Ukraine will probably become a member of NATO. But a more likely outcome, if current trends on the battlefield continue, is that Ukraine will return to a constitutional neutrality as a part of a peaceful resolution of the conflict. NATO has probably realized that they can't have what they aspired to, and will not risk open conflict with Russia to achieve a maximal goal. In the end NATO will accept a smaller and neutral Ukraine,” the observer summed up.",DISINFORMATION

https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/eu-punishes-georgia-for-being-independent-and-not-russophobic-enough/,https://www.rt.com/news/604784-eu-us-trying-blackmail-georgia/,2024-09-27,"You will comply: This post-Soviet country is too independent for the West. Punishment is at hand Say what you will about the EU’s “elites,” they are persistent. They are on the verge of losing the Ukraine proxy war they have been waging under US command against Russia, but they never miss a chance to antagonize. This time it’s Georgia’s turn – the one in the Caucasus, of course: Brussels would never dare raise its voice about anything in the US, no matter how rotten the sorry remnants of “democracy” are over there. If the Georgian government – duly elected and all that but still led by the Georgian Dream party, which Eurocrats love to hate – won’t do as told by the EU, then, so the warning from the European Commission, “all options are on the table, including the potential temporary suspension of the visa liberalization scheme.” What this means is that Georgians would lose their right, based on a 2017 agreement, to travel to and within the EU’s Schengen Zone for up to six months without a visa. After the somewhat abstract de facto suspension of Georgia’s EU candidacy, this is a very concrete and mean threat to level painful sanctions at ordinary citizens. The official EU reasoning behind it is that, supposedly, Georgia is backsliding on whatever the Commission – a thoroughly unelected body currently completing a coup-like executive power grab in the EU – considers “democracy.” Irony was yesterday. Silly “value” infowar talking points aside, the real reason is, of course, that Georgia has failed to be sufficiently Russophobic. Look, for comparison, at Ukraine: Not a shred of anything a non-delusional observer could mistake for democracy; and yet Kiev is in the very best graces of Ursula von der Leyen and her Commission. Graces just recently worth yet another €35 billion reward, from a Europe that is, really, rather bankrupt. Nope, this is not about how people vote but about geopolitics, once again. No wonder Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze has denounced the fresh EU move as “cheap blackmail.” That is exactly what it is. And worse: a textbook attempt to implement that evil recipe the West can’t stop loving even while it keeps failing: to make ordinary people suffer by sanctions so that they, according to the endlessly wrong theory, will then get rid of the governments that the West wants gone. In this case, there are two options for that outcome that are certain to be on Brussels’ minds: First, violent regime change color revolution-style. It has been tried repeatedly in Georgia (and succeeded once, in 2003, ultimately opening a path to a small yet devastating war with Russia, in 2008, when Georgia attacked its neighbors and was betrayed by the West). There’s no sign that the West has given up on the idea. Second, there is the way via the upcoming Georgian elections of October 26. Yes, you read that right: Clearly, the EU is perfectly aware that Georgia has a functioning democracy (unlike the EU), because it is precisely the core of that democracy, the electoral process, that this EU threat is targeting in the crudest manner imaginable: Georgian voters, so goes the message from Brussels, get these guys out of power or we will get you out of the EU. As simple, as brutal, as shameless as that. Election interference 101. Moscow is, unsurprisingly, well aware of the EU’s habit of using visa privileges as geopolitical tools of, in effect, blackmail and interference. In a recent statement addressing EU policy on Armenia, Maria Zakharova, representing Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, pinpointed this type of “open manipulation” and its aim to make local states submit to Western interests, including by sowing hostility among them. In return, the “locals” will receive mostly empty promises and deliberate delays, while any concessions by the EU will take the shape of privileges ready to be revoked if the recipient rebels. As Zakharova also recalled, this is a longstanding tactic already applied to multiple countries, including not only Armenia, but also Ukraine, Moldova, the states of the western Balkans, and, once upon a time, even Russia. The EU is, of course, not alone. It is acting in unison with its masters in Washington, who have been ramping up their longstanding regime-change pressure on Georgia as well. Just a few weeks ago, US kind-of-still President Joe Biden issued a threat thinly disguised as a statement of “steadfast support” for Georgia’s sovereignty. Support, that is, as long as “the Georgian people” show sufficient eagerness in keeping up “their Euro-Atlantic aspirations.” At the same time, the “Georgian government” – perish the thought it might actually represent the “Georgian people”! – got rapped over the knuckles for its “anti-democratic actions, exemplified by the Kremlin-style ‘foreign agents’ law and Georgian government officials’ false statements, which are inconsistent with EU and NATO membership norms.” The message could not be clearer: Nice sovereignty you have there. Pity if something happened to it if you won’t obey us. Us being NATO and the EU, that is, the collective West, that is, Washington. The scare tactics have not been restricted to words alone. The US State Department – aka the Arms-for-Israel-and-Sanctions-for-the-Rest-of-Them Department – has pounded Georgia with a blitz of over 60 sanctions, all ostensibly due to Tbilisi having the temerity of legally and properly producing legislation that Washington does not like, namely the foreign influence law that Biden chose to misrepresent as a foreign agent law. Even worse, the Georgian government passed the law despite the usual Western efforts to mobilize street violence celebrated as “civil society” to topple it. Yet Tbilisi had to act. Due to the West’s relentless attempts to abuse foreign aid to interfere in Georgia’s politics, the country has developed a hypertrophic and lopsided NGO sphere, with 25,000 organizations for a population of well under 4 million. While many small NGOs are genuine enough, a small set of large organizations function as aggressive agents of Western influence. Holding, according to an important recent analysis, “considerable power over the Georgian population” that does not stem from “grassroots support,” these “unelected NGOs get their mandate from international bodies” and “are not accountable to the citizens in whose lives they play such an intrusive role. This constellation has eroded Georgian citizens’ agency and the country’s sovereignty and democracy.” The same analysis, it should be noted, also argues that the current Georgian legislation is not the right answer to this problem. That may be the case or not: every government designs effective and less effective laws. The key point remains that every government has a right to do so, as long as it proceeds legally, which was clearly the case in Tbilisi. Or how would US legislation proceed – on, let’s say, guns or schools or healthcare – if other, better-run countries claimed a right to interfere because of its abysmal quality? And, as a recent article in Responsible Statecraft – an unusual and fairly marginal American publication that strives to cast a critical eye on US foreign policy – correctly notes, Tbilisi’s legislation to make the field of foreign aid transparent is neither “inherently undemocratic” nor “Russian inspired.” In reality, the law’s requirements are modest – often less than what Western laws, including America’s aggressive FARA, demand – and reasonable. So reasonable, in fact, that you have to wonder what those feeling so triggered by it – inside and outside Georgia – have to hide and lose. The good news is that Tbilisi’s leaders are not afraid to call out Washington’s interference as well. Shalva Papuashvili, the president of Georgia’s parliament, has gone public stating that the American attitude to his country does not correspond to the “strategic partnership” that officially exists between Washington and Tbilisi. Instead, the US elites are treating their Georgian “partners” to “false accusations,” hostile narratives, condescension, and attempts to impose US interests, and, of course, sanctions. Speaking of sanctions: Tbilisi has had enough. The recent wave of them, as a member of the parliament’s de facto majority bloc has publicly deplored, a “crude interference” in the upcoming elections. That’s not only true, but also exactly what the US is doing deliberately: as with the EU’s visa threat, there is nothing accidental about the timing of Washington’s sanctions attack. No wonder that Prime Minister Kobakhidze has put the US ambassador on notice that the American sanctions addiction has brought Georgian-US relations to a “critical point”; one more such decision out of Washington, he has warned, and Tbilisi might carry out a “substantial re-assessment” of the relationship with the US. That may indeed be necessary and inevitable. And the reason, ultimately, has nothing to do with Georgia. It is the never-ending hubris of Western elites who cannot wean themselves off the delusion that other countries’ sovereignty isn’t really quite real. In the final analysis – and neither Washington nor Brussels ever take long to get to that point – what matters is what the West wants. And if it does not get what it wants, then blackmail, sanctions, an interference come into play. This pathological misbehavior has become routine in the West. Only failure, again and again, will break it. Let’s hope that Georgia becomes another Western defeat.

https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/blind-support-for-ukraine-broke-germany/,https://www.rt.com/news/607465-support-ukraine-crashed-german-government/,2024-11-11,"How blind support for Ukraine broke Germany Germans love stability. Their whole political system is designed to prevent change or, at least, to slow it down to a glacial pace. Germans also love to complain. That’s why they can’t stop grousing about the obvious stagnation (another word for “stability”) of their country. They also love compromises that to many others would seem foul and ineffective but appear reasonable and, again, stable to them. That’s why they are stuck between wanting nothing to change and everything to finally get better. Yet, from time to time, that German system of national frustration recycling breaks down at the top. Such a collapse has just occurred. On Wednesday, November 6, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz dismissed Finance Minister Christian Lindner. He thereby also ended the so-called “traffic light” coalition that has ruled Germany – for bad and for worse – for almost three years. Named after the colors of the participating parties, the coalition consisted of Scholz’s own “red” SPD party (the Social-Democrats, who are so centrist they might as well be conservatives), the Greens (right-wing NATO-fetishists and fanatic Russophobes who also like to ruin the economy), and the “yellow” FDP (center-right “free-market” liberals whose worst nightmare is taxation). Since former finance minister Linder is also the head of the FDP, booting him out in what the New York Times has rightly described as a “spectacular breakup” led to all other FDP ministers – except one who rather abandoned his party than his cabinet position – also exiting the government. This leaves the latter in existence but dead in the water, commanding only a minority in the federal parliament, and incapable of actually governing. Now the question is what comes next. Or to be precise, when: Since the parliamentary opposition, mainly the centrist conservatives from the CDU, is not politically suicidal and therefore will certainly not provide majorities for Scholz and his rump government, early elections are inevitable. If the coalition had lasted its full term, they would have taken place at the end of September next year. Now they will happen some time in its first quarter. When exactly is currently a matter of contention. In constitutional terms, how to get to these emergency elections is clear: Scholz will have to call a confidence vote in parliament to predictably lose it. This will allow the German president – mostly a representative figure – to disband the parliament and initiate the elections. (A hypothetically possible variant of this maneuver that would lead directly to the establishment of a new, CDU-conservative-led government has been ruled out, for now, by their leader Friedrich Merz.) Politically, things are not so simple. Without going into excessive detail, the key fact here is that the constitution sets certain deadlines, but individual players still have room for maneuver. This means that Scholz is interested in delaying the elections until late March, which made him announce his confidence vote for as late as January 15. That was a transparently selfish and desperate attempt to skew a losing game in his favor. Unsurprisingly, his rivals insist on moving much faster. The conservatives from the CDU, trying to profit from their own favorable polling numbers and the ruling coalition’s breakdown and unpopularity, plausibly argue that Scholz is “eine lame duck” (in Germano-English in the original, by the way; the German elite just is that way) and that the country is in crisis and cannot afford an excessive interregnum. Scholz’s former partners, now enemies, in the FDP also call on him to get a move on and “make room.” This particular game for advantage-by-timing will play out one way or another. But since it won’t make a great difference, it is not very interesting. There are more important issues to discuss. Regarding the causes of the coalition collapse, there are many, of course, including that it was always a rickety contraption bringing together ideologically unsuited partners, represented by often dissembling and backstabbing personalities with immense egos. The premeditated and below-the-belt manner in which Scholz went after his former finance minister after kicking him out was, as the conservative Welt newspaper rightly noted, indecently demagogic. But it was also simply representative of the true, for want of better words, moral climate in that anti-team. The bitter, cheap mud-slinging from the very top also signaled – once there was nothing to lose and all pretense was dropped – just how much mutual hostility the coalition members used to hide from the public. In that sense, the true, toxic atmosphere among them resembled the senility of outgoing US President Joe Biden – not really a secret for anyone with eyes to see, while still veiled in much opportunistic lying, and, finally, coming out with an unseemly embarrassment made worse by all that preceding hypocrisy. But two issues stick out among the reasons for the end of the coalition: The economy, obviously, and, not so obviously perhaps but all the more intriguingly, Ukraine. The immediate trigger for the showdown among the non-partners were fundamental disagreements over how to address Germany’s deep economic crisis that has made the country the worst performer in the G7. In addition, the impending second presidency of Donald Trump will make things even harder not only for German politicians but for German business as well: Trump’s long-announced tariff increases are certain to hit Germany, too. Currently, German companies are profiting from a record trade surplus with the US, but that is also painting a giant target on them for Trump. They will face even greater pressures to leave Germany behind as too expensive and shift production elsewhere, including, of course, to the US. The money question was made urgent for the coalition more than a year ago, when Germany’s Constitutional Court invalidated a large chunk of its 2024 budget as, to put it bluntly, fraudulent. Which it was. Since then, the coalition partners have had no money to paper over their differences and this fact, in turn, made it impossible to put a budget together for next year and helped produce the breakdown. Against that dismal backdrop, former finance minister Lindner argued for the usual neoliberal panacea of austerity and cuts, in particular defending a strict application of Germany’s retrograde “Debt Break,” an economically daftly rigid constitutional prohibition against providing stimulus by increasing budget deficits. His partners in the coalition, with Scholz and the SPD in the lead, argued for a more flexible approach or, of course, for more handouts for their constituencies. But make no mistake, these policy positions are close to irrelevant because no one wants to address Berlin’s real core problem, namely the decision to cut itself off from inexpensive Russian energy. Which brings us to the second, less obvious but very important trigger of the collapse of the coalition: Ukraine. At first it was almost a rumor, but it is now clear that one issue that Scholz and Lindner could not agree on was (even) more money for, yet again, Kiev. It is true that Scholz launched a whole volley of provocatively inacceptable dealbreakers at his former finance minister. The impression that, at this point, the chancellor wanted to drive the coalition into the ground while seeking ways to shift the blame is well-founded: Scholz demanded fresh subsidies for energy companies, special government gifts for enterprises that stay in Germany (yes, that’s how desperate the situation is), and a new subsidy set for the tanking car industry. There was no reason to assume that Lindner – or his party, which is fighting for electoral survival – could possibly concede any of the above. And then, the icing on the cake: more money for Ukraine and, again, for that purpose as well the suspension of the “Debt Break.” The “Debt Break” is economically illiterate. But it also is, unfortunately, a constitutional rule. Lindner may have a tendency to dramatize his personal struggle over this bad piece of policy. Yet he is absolutely correct that neither he nor the chancellor can simply pretend it is not there. And while the law does allow for exceptions in emergencies, the current government seems to think that every day is emergency day. That one of these emergencies was supposed to be to throw yet more money at a losing and self-defeating proxy war against Russia via Ukraine is something special again: It is as if the German government feels more responsibility for Ukraine than for Germany. Indeed, German Foreign Minister Annalena “360 Degrees” Baerbock confirmed that impression again in a recent talk show: There she blamed Germany’s misery – drum roll – on Putin and then, quite stunningly, admitted that Berlin has given Ukraine almost €40 billion ($42.6 billion) by “painful” cuts in other – i.e. domestic, including “social” – parts of the budget. Make no mistake: Lindner is no representative of reason. His idea was to not give Ukraine more money again but deliver Taurus missiles instead. He had a point about the budget; his proposed solution betrayed reckless idiocy. It is sad, but even at this point almost no one in the German elites – whether political or media – is prepared to finally recognize that what Berlin needs to do is repair its relationship with Moscow. Such voices are there but still on the margins. Before that insight becomes mainstream again – if ever – Germany will not be able to solve its worsening problems. And who knows? Maybe this is not the last German government to fall, among other things, over Ukraine.

The SIS was created by the WWII-era Special Operations Executive and is also known as MI6. Moore made the admission in a speech at the British Embassy in Paris on Friday at the reception for his French counterpart, Nicolas Lerner of the DGSE. “We cherish our heritage of covert action which we keep alive today in helping Ukraine resist the Russian invasion,” Moore said at one point. His admission came just a day after former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson openly declared that Ukraine is a proxy of NATO in a war against Russia. “Let’s face it: We’re waging a proxy war but not giving our proxies the ability to do the job,” Johnson told the Daily Telegraph, arguing that “the problem has not been escalation; the problem has been the failure to escalate fast enough.” Russia has long known about the role of British – and American – intelligence operatives in Ukraine. Last month, Moscow’s ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, told the Security Council that “Western intelligence agencies, primarily the British MI6, have systematically prepared Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance groups to organize provocations at nuclear power plants in Russia.” According to Ukrainian media, the UK has also pushed Kiev into military adventures such as the Krynki bridgehead, where hundreds of elite marines perished trying to create a foothold on the other bank of the Dnieper. British mercenaries have also taken part in the Ukrainian incursion into Russia’s Kursk Region. In February, the New York Times revealed an almost decade-long effort by the CIA to shape Ukraine into a weapon against Russia, implicating several allied intelligence services as well. The current head of Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR), Kirill Budanov, is among the operatives trained by American spies. The CIA and the MI6 were on the ground in Ukraine as early as 2014, former Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) employee Vasily Prozorov testified in March 2019. Speaking in Moscow, Prozorov named some of the British agents who visited the front line in Donbass, as well as the special forces training grounds in Berdichev. In his speech in Paris, Moore insisted that France and Britain are “united and unflinching in our determination to support Ukraine for as long as it takes,” arguing that NATO can prevail because it has “many times Russia’s GDP and defense budget.” “We should never doubt that our alliance has strength in numbers, both economic and military, and our unity of purpose makes that count,” the British spymaster claimed, adding that “Our democracy is our strength.”",DISINFORMATION

The EU is having a full-blown existential crisis. Someone has really screwed up its economy, and the culprit is conspicuously absent from a new report outlining the carnage. Are there no mirrors in Brussels? Former European Central Bank president and Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, has published a new “economic competitiveness” report after a year of work at the request of unelected ‘Queen’ Ursula von der Leyen’s ‘Royal’ European Commission. And it’s a real page-turner, one of the great mysteries of our times. One is left to breathlessly leaf through the 400-page document looking for a culprit responsible for the massive amount of economic carnage detailed by Draghi. “For the first time since the Cold War we must genuinely fear for our self-preservation,” he told reporters in Brussels. How about starting off by not actively self-sabotaging? Draghi said that the bloc desperately needs to keep up with China and the US, but has been failing. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that the EU readily jumped in to ride shotgun alongside Uncle Sam along regime change highway, but now finds itself kicking dirt on the roadside and wanting to make its own way. “Now conditions have changed,” Draghi said. “World trade is slowing. China is actually slowing very much, but it’s become much less open to us, and actually it’s competing with us in global markets on all accounts. We’ve lost our main supplier of cheap energy, Russia. And now we have to start for our defense again for the first time since the Second World War.” Apparently, the jokers ruling Europe from the big top tent in Brussels are shocked to discover that they’ve been victimized. Who could possibly have done such a thing? Gotta love the use of the passive there. “Lost” their cheap energy from Russia. Like it just fell out of their pocket like a set of house keys on the way back from the store. Listening to Draghi, you’d also think that the EU hasn’t actually adopted “de-coupling” from China as a strategy, egged on by Washington, which wanted Europe all to itself, before EU officials rebranded it a “de-risking” when they realized how stupid a move it would be to fully alienate China as the bloc’s top trading partner and customer. And now, oh gee, the EU has to start thinking about its own defense again, Draghi said, rather than just using it to shake free some natural resources from all the places with fortuitously-located terrorist problems. The Ukraine conflict has been an equally convenient excuse to make more weapons at taxpayer expense for the EU’s own defense after emptying out the old junk from its closets. Good thing, too, because making more weapons is about the only real easy answer for improving the economy right now, judging by the dire state of things outlined in this new report. Still, the EU can’t even do the military-industrial racket right. Draghi has pointed out that EU members are basically idiots for buying most of their weapons abroad, with nearly two-thirds coming from the US. Big mystery as to why Washington wants to keep the party going in Ukraine when it’s making bank by drumming up the need to ramp up weapons purchases for EU members under the guise that their former top economic lifeline and energy supplier (Russia) was suddenly a big threat to them. The bonus: making Europe more dependent on the US for pricier gas, too. The whole report is just loaded with gems, like this one: “If Europe cannot become more productive, we will be forced to choose. We will not be able to become, at once, a leader in new technologies, a beacon of climate responsibility and an independent player on the world stage. We will not be able to finance our social model. We will have to scale back some, if not all, of our ambitions. This is an existential challenge...” Draghi’s going on about all these grand ambitions like leading new tech and being a climate and social icon, while European elites have been yelling at the plebs to turn down the heating and air conditioning to stick it to Putin and cheering mild winters like we’re living in the dark ages. Draghi also said that the EU needs another €800 billion ($890 billion), which is about 4.5% of the entire bloc’s GDP, just to be able to stay globally competitive. And that competitiveness can only be achieved by thoroughly unscrewing everything they screwed up over the past two and a half years through self-inflicted idiocy in the interests of impressing their girlfriend Vladimir Zelensky (aka president of Ukraine). Draghi also said that the amount of cash needed to make the EU competitive now is so massive that private investment just won’t cut it. And well, you know what that means. In related news, EU taxpayers, there’s a sale right now on Amazon France for €4 tubes of lube. But what if EU taxpayers don’t want to comply, because they’ve had enough of paying for all these screwups, as recent elections across the EU suggest, with anti-establishment parties surging. Well, here’s Draghi with a plea. Cue the violins: “Why do we care so much about growing. Yes, we have to finance these needs, and these needs are important, but why are they so important? Well, they are important because they have to do with our founding values, prosperity, equity, peace and democracy in a sustainable world. And the EU exists to ensure Europeans that they actually will benefit from these fundamental rights. And if Europe can no longer provide them to its people, it will have lost its reason for being.” Okay, put the lube on ice, folks – he’s giving seduction a try. Queen Ursula will no doubt be along shortly to play the “bad cop.” So basically, the EU’s ‘braintrust’ blew a bunch of cash and deregulated the economy “for Ukraine”, but now they need Europeans to be okay with handing over even more cash, because it’s totally for their own good. This time it’ll work out. Promise. Just like it did with that ex who you let crawl back into your life one too many times. Meanwhile, von der Leyen is talking about the need for economic supply security and Draghi is saying that the EU needs more friends. Ones that happen to have a ton of resources that they can cozy up to, preferably. And he’s also saying that some countries are already trying to do that on their own, but it would be better if the EU took charge of it. Draghi added that the bloc was “punching under our power.” More like it’s been punching itself right in the face, over and over again, if the EU’s recent policies and performance are any indication.

https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/eu-is-vilifying-putin-to-push-its-authoritarian-green-energy-agenda/,https://www.rt.com/news/592544-renewable-energy-agenda-putin-leyen/,2024-02-19,"Putin is the new climate change: Von der Leyen drags the Russian president into her green fantasies It’s hard to tell if she’s blaming him or crediting him, but European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told a meeting of the Paris-based Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on February 13th that “[Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s attempt to blackmail our union has utterly failed. On the contrary, he really pushed the green transition.” The word “pushed” is telling – and projecting. Because that’s exactly what she’s been doing – evoking Putin to manipulate EU citizens into acceptance of a profitable system of greenwashed authoritarianism. Putin’s been a busy guy here in Europe lately. Just the other week, he was apparently pushing Europe’s farmers and their tractors onto highways. Why does Queen Ursula always have to sound so shady? “Last year, in 2023, for the first time ever, we produced more electricity from wind than from gas,” she said. How many ways did her battle-hardened brigade of bureaucratic paper-cut Purple Hearts have to parse the data to come up with that bright spot? Because the truth is that, at 37% of the EU’s electrical power, renewables are still only just a half a percent more prevalent than fossil fuels at 36.5%, according to the EU’s own data – and that really hasn’t changed much over the past several years. And it’s not like wind, at 13% of the bloc’s electrical production, is doing the heavy lifting in powering Europe’s industry when 60% of its energy is still imported, most of which is from fossil fuels. If wind and solar were actually capable of maintaining European industry, then why was the economy minister of the bloc’s economic engine, Germany, bragging to citizens that he was doing his part to stick it to Russian President Vladimir Putin by taking ever shorter showers? Why did I personally have to freeze my arsch off at some of the local swimming pools in Berlin last month as the water temperature plunged to accommodate an energy austerity plan if wind was such a panacea? Germany is the canary in the coal mine for the EU green transition, having gone all-in, and clearly wind and solar weren’t ready for prime time when the cheap Russian gas tap was effectively turned off – first through the EU’s own anti-Russian sanctions that complicated payment for sales, then when it was blown up altogether. This is why the German economy is taking a hit, with the country’s own national statistics office now qualifying the economic environment as “marked by multiple crises,” as last year’s GDP dropped by 0.3%, with high energy prices as one of the top contributing factors. If mighty gusts of wind could singlehandedly prevent German deindustrialization as industry bails to less fantasy-powered jurisdictions, then Queen Ursula’s speeches alone would have long since done the job. In this latest one, von der Leyen laments the Russian president’s attempt to “blackmail” Europe with fossil fuels while at the same time saying that whatever’s left of them can’t disappear fast enough. If that seems like a contradiction, it is. The truth is that Putin just served as a convenient pretext for something that Brussels had long wanted to do anyway, but was prevented from doing because of how it feared the average EU citizen would react. It’s now obvious what the impact of the green transition is on inflation as energy costs have skyrocketed. If the EU had pulled a stunt like this by simply caving to Washington’s relentless insistence that it renege on Nord Stream pipeline gas, telling Europeans that it was pivoting to far pricier US liquified natural gas – at least until it could figure out how to use the basic elements of earth to live like a developed country using tactics from the Stone Age – people would have gone ballistic and wondered what the heck was really going on. Putin came along just in time to rescue the transition from the growing skepticism of the climate-change excuse, fueling popularity for the right-wing populist parties calling the Brussels establishment out for its use of it to manipulate citizens into compliance with their agenda. What agenda, exactly? Profits, first and foremost. Ask the farmers currently protesting all across Europe against a heavy-handed Brussels bureaucracy put into place that increasingly controls their production using everything from climate change policies that put precious farmland into the state’s hands through buyouts of climate change policy offenders, to pro-Ukraine trade policies that crush domestic production in favor of Ukraine’s Western-backed corporate Big Farming, like Bayer, Monsanto, Cargill, and DuPont. When the Ukraine conflict went hot, Queen Ursula just substituted Putin for the climate-change excuse, then kept hammering the need to plough cash into renewable energy projects that just happen to be dominated by European and American big finance and their investors, like US defense contractor General Electric, Germany’s BASF, Shell, and BP. Von der Leyen dropped a hint herself that all this is about not wanting to share the pie outside of her coffee klatch. “The old fossil fuel economy is all about dependencies. The new clean energy economy is all about inter-dependencies,” she said, pointing out that “clean energy can be produced anywhere.” And that means being able to keep the profits among your friends and supporters. Interesting that she used the term “inter-dependencies” rather than “independence.” You’d think that national sovereignty would be a good thing. But apparently not when it could mean a country being able to tell Brussels to bugger off. Both climate change and national security are profitable causes, first and foremost. They should just be honest about that rather than trying to hard-sell it with virtue-signaling and bogeymen. But it’s the increased authoritarianism to control emissions or the ubiquitous “Russian threat” by introducing policies and tools that can also be used to quash domestic dissent, that are even more troubling. And for Brussels that seems to be a nice bonus. It all smacks of increased supranational consolidation and control over a system that’s being reoriented to profit members of a certain political caste and their cronies. And they’re apparently willing to use whatever fearmongering they figure works best to subdue the masses into compliance. Putin should really start charging appearance fees for being constantly used in their advertising.

On Wednesday, an Il-76 transport plane was downed in Russian airspace. It was reportedly carrying 65 Ukrainian POWs scheduled for a prisoner swap, escorted by three Russian military guards, as well as six crew members. All on board were killed. It seems the aircraft was destroyed by missiles launched from a US-supplied Patriot system. The incident prompts a critical question: What were the Ukrainian soldiers doing so far from their homeland that air transportation was necessary? The answer is simple: The POWs were initially held in the Lugansk and Donetsk People’s Republics, but then came a Ukrainian HIMARS attack on a prisoner camp in Olenovka near Volnovakha on July 29, 2022, killing 53 people. This seems to have been the reason for the transfer, aiming to distance the POWs from high-tech precision weapons systems provided to Kiev by NATO. Today, we can say with absolute certainty that this did not help. Ukraine has once again shown the world just how dangerous it can be for its own citizens. What happened? Around noon on Wednesday, Moscow time (9am GMT), footage spread online depicting the crash on snow-covered fields. A distinctive church seen on video meant the location was soon identified as being near the village of Yablonovo, Korochansky District, in Belgorod Region. Almost immediately, Ukrainian Telegram channels, both anonymous and verified (such as Unian and Ukrainskaya Pravda), were inundated with posts citing sources close to the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). These posts claimed that a) the plane was purportedly carrying missiles for Russia’s S-300 systems intended for use in attacks on Kharkov, and b) the downing was attributed to the Kiev's actions. A short time later, the Russian Defense Ministry officially announced that 65 captured Ukrainian soldiers who were being transported to Belgorod for a prisoner exchange were on board the plane, along with six crew members and three guards. Immediately afterwards, statements about the involvement of Kiev’s forces began to disappear from the Ukrainian internet, as well as any mention of the alleged cargo (missiles for the S-300 system). At 3pm Moscow time, the Russian Defense Ministry made an official announcement, stating that two Ukrainian missiles had been launched from the Liptsy suburb of Kharkov. The point of impact was approximately 100km away, a range well within the coverage of the AFU’s Patriot missiles of all modifications, including PAC-2 GEM-T and PAC-3 MSE. Concurrently, lists featuring the names of Ukrainian servicemen surfaced, which can be verified through the meticulous maintenance of Ukrainian POW databases by dedicated enthusiasts. Background Belgorod’s civilian airport has been shut down since Russia launched its military operation in February 2022. This closure is a precautionary measure due to the airport’s location within the range of Ukrainian air defenses. Nevertheless, the air transportation of prisoners to Belgorod for exchange is a well-established practice. Previous instances were conducted using the Il-76 aircraft, notably on January 3, 2024, with the actual exchange occurring on January 8. It’s reasonable to assume that the Ukrainian side was notified about these flights, similar to how Russia is informed about visits by foreign leaders to Kiev. On Wednesday, two planes were involved; the second Il-76 aircraft, transporting another group of prisoners, promptly reversed course and returned to base after the first aircraft crashed. The AFU’s actions have precedents. On multiple occasions, they have covertly positioned Western air defense systems, including Patriots and IRIS-Ts, near the border of Belgorod Region or the line of contact, attempting to use them to engage aircraft within Russian airspace. Despite claiming success in these operations, Ukrainian forces have consistently failed to substantiate their reports with evidence. What now? Ukraine, as always, is firmly in denial, so we are unlikely to learn the real motives behind the actions of its military anytime soon. Was it a mistake caused by a lack of coordination and general sloppiness, a deliberate provocation, or both? Were they aiming to shoot the plane down on its way home with Russian POWs on board, but something went wrong? Is this the end of prisoner exchanges? One would hope not. In just under two years, more than a thousand captured Russian soldiers have been brought home in POW swaps, but many others are still being held captive, so these exchanges need to go on. Will there be any reaction from the West? I’m certain there won’t be. At best, we’ll hear routine hypocritical expressions of concern, or, more likely, another round of tirades about how Russia is to blame. The West continues to use Ukraine, while it can get away with it, and will keep turning a blind eye to anything, including the killing of Ukrainians by Western “weapons of freedom.” Not that it matters to the dead Russian pilots or Ukrainian soldiers who were on their way home. What matters is that the idea that the Ukrainian government being the worst enemy of its own people has just be bolstered. Moloch The Ukrainian army, which is getting weaker by the day, is not fighting for a “better future.” The Ukrainian army is not fighting for “freedom.” People at the highest levels in Kiev have confirmed that they were offered what would be incredibly accommodating terms by current standards at the peace negotiations with Russia in Istanbul back in March and April 2022. The Ukrainian army is not fighting “to expel the enemy,” as only the craziest of fanatics continue to claim that this can be achieved by military means. It’s not even fighting for “the European way,” as NATO and EU membership is receding into background, like a dot on the horizon, which is no secret to anyone. The Ukrainian army is fighting and Ukrainian soldiers are rotting alive in rat-infested trenches, dying by the thousands for one thing only: to keep the current Kiev regime in power. It’s a regime that refuses to accept reality and keeps saying it’s winning. It’s a regime that has no qualms about sacrificing thousands upon thousands of its own citizens for a fleeting spot in the media limelight, just for the show. It sacrificed them in Bakhmut, even though trying to hold the city was clearly pointless. It sacrificed them near Rabotino, even though the Ukrainian army leadership realized the failure of the counteroffensive after just a few days. It sacrificed them during suicidal, flag-waving raids on Snake Island and Crimea, even though few came back from those escapades. It’s sacrificing them today in Krynki, in Avdeevka, and near Belgorod – just like that, for nothing in particular. Every day, Ukraine’s plight is getting worse. Zelensky is running out of fuel for his fire, but he keeps throwing more soldiers into the flames, sending people-catchers to grab anyone they can get their hands on in the street. All of those are not separate incidents but the work of an inhuman machine of annihilation, which will only go down when the Ukrainian state falls. The plane incident is just another episode. But one would like to think that this will be the straw that breaks the camel's back. If that happens, it will mean that the deaths of our pilots and Ukrainian POWs will not have been in vain.",DISINFORMATION

The first round of voting on October 20 followed what was thought to be a tight race between pro-Western President Maia Sandu and Party of Socialists (PSRM) leader and former Prosecutor General Alexandr Stoianoglo, who has publicly advocated dialogue with Russia and claimed his opponent is deliberately ruining relations with Moscow. The results gave Sandu 41.86% and Stoianoglo 26.32% of the vote, necessitating a run-off. At the time, the EU accused Russia of “unprecedented interference and intimidation” during the election. Moscow has rejected the allegation while claiming that the Moldovan government was engaged in voter suppression. In a statement on Thursday, the SVR claimed that the OSCE leadership “privately acknowledges the unprecedented level of violations by the authorities” during the Moldovan election, adding that the organization had received several reports to this effect from its observers. Among the most blatant violations was the “widespread use of administrative resources” as Chisinau threatened to drastically cut funding to local administrations if they did not ensure that the election produced the desired results, the intel agency said. Moldova’s Central Electoral Commission “instructed district election commissions to ensure the ‘correct’ counting of votes, including by making adjustments to the protocols of the district commissions,” the SVR stated, adding that there were neither independent control measures nor reliable voter data at polling stations for the Moldovan diaspora in European countries. According to the SVR, the OSCE leadership “is convinced that the Moldovan authorities will take similar measures” during the November run-off, with the ultimate goal of ensuring Sandu’s victory. The agency added that the OSCE has no plans to call out Moldova over election fraud. “Leading Western countries, primarily the US… insist on this. This is due to the fact that Washington and its allies want Sandu’s re-election and Chisinau to continue its course of accelerated rapprochement with the EU and NATO,” it concluded. The presidential vote in the ex-Soviet republic also coincided with a high-stakes referendum in which voters were asked whether the Moldovan constitution should be amended to say that the country’s “strategic objective” is “integration into the European Union.” The vote revealed a deep divide on the issue, with a razor-thin majority of 50.38% supporting the amendment.",DISINFORMATION

Contact us: info@strategic-culture.su Anyone who, based on past experience, might have anticipated the human sacrifice orchestrated to garnish the NATO meeting in Washington was not to be disappointed. The latest Russian rocket barrage on Ukrainian military and strategic targets, which occurred on the eve of the NATO summit in DC, presented an opportunity too precious to miss. Targeting only military or industrial sites would have done little to animate the NATO meeting or to get everyone onto the same page. But hitting a children’s hospital and killing some kids would be almost guaranteed to do the trick. Being in “total disarray,” as Alexander Mercouris bluntly put it, NATO could certainly benefit from this boost of adrenalin and whatever cohesive impulse dead children might provide to that ghastly organisation. The Russian Government are not fools. They understand the game perfectly, and within hours the false flag in Kiev was irrefutably exposed. Their UN ambassador spelled the plot out in minute detail, for the benefit of the Security Council and anyone else in the “international community” disposed to listen. The staged atrocity in Kiev is a technique that was elaborated to perfection in Sarajevo during the conflict in Bosnia in the 1990s. Whenever important Western visitors were scheduled to arrive or decisions deemed crucial to the interests of the Muslim-run Izetbegovic regime supported by Western powers were due to be taken, like clockwork a lethal event would be orchestrated for political and propaganda effect. One of the most notorious, and without wishing to be blasphemous it could also accurately be sad – iconic, incidents in this rubric was the Vaso Miskin Street massacre of people waiting in the breadline. It was staged by the local authorities on May 27, 1992 (also here). The timing was significant because at the end of May of that year a session of the UN Security Council was set to consider imposing draconian sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, to punish it for supporting their Bosnian compatriots. The massacre in which dozens perished was therefore staged right on cue, to give powerful “humanitarian” impetus to Security Council’s scheduled deliberations. It worked brilliantly and the sanctions were imposed. A series of similar false flag propaganda operations subsequently were organised at regular intervals, for the duration of the Bosnian conflict. Readers will recall the two Markale bombings in 1994, which followed exactly the same pattern, and there are other examples that could also be cited. Readers may draw their own conclusions concerning the timing of the Kiev Children’s Hospital blast in relation to the NATO Summit being held in Washington, where the regimentation of member states behind the Ukraine war agenda without the slightest doubt is the predominant priority (see here). One of the most noteworthy curiosities of this year’s NATO conference is the presence at the table of a very odd and by normal criteria least expected participant, Serbia. The question that first comes to mind, of course, is what could possibly motivate militarily neutral Serbia to take part in the plenary conference of a military alliance of which it is not even a member, and which – for perfectly understandable moral and psychological reasons – over 90% percent of its population abhor, as the latest public opinion surveys clearly show? What business do the Serbian government have attending the 75th anniversary festivities of a military/political bloc with the evillest of reputations which, moreover, has treated Serbia with nothing but extreme violence and unambiguous contempt? None whatsoever, of course, if the matter were to be judged by normal standards, which necessarily includes such basic things as respecting the unequivocal will of your constituents, adhering to the still binding neutrality law passed by your country’s Parliament, and last but not least evidencing due regard for the vital national interest of the nation that supposedly you are serving. But the aforementioned considerations form no part, even to the smallest degree, of the raison d’être which shapes the policies of Serbia’s duplicitous leadership. Brown nosing NATO at its 75th anniversary is however only the latest, and the most blatant example of how the Serbian regime conducts its foreign relations. There are other examples which could also be cited. Under the radar, on 8 November 2016 official Serbia, the one with NATO officers comfortably ensconced in its Army General Staff Headquarters, joined the Helbroc Balkan Battlegroup, a NATO combat outfit consisting of regional vassal states and Ukraine. Serbia has already participated in a number of Helbroc exercises, contributing for that purpose its military personnel and equipment. Map showing Helbroc member states, including Serbia The official mission of Helbroc forces is to serve as an urgent intervention unit. While deceptively portrayed as a European Union grouping, its agglomeration of forces consists of NATO member state personnel, with the sole exception of Ukraine and Serbia. Its units are subordinated to the command of officers from Greece, a NATO member state. A review of the Helbroc accession agreement that Serbia signed reflects a commitment to execute “crisis management tasks” with other, mostly NATO, signatories within “and beyond” EU territory. That geographically open ended formulation is a red flag. It could justify the utilisation of Serbian armed forces in a wide variety of conflict situations having nothing to do with Serbia’s security or interests, subject to instructions issued by NATO military command structures to which the Helbroc Battle Group is clearly subordinated. Hypothetical combat use of this military formation against Russia can by no means be excluded. As noted by retired Serbian Army colonel Žarko Pecić, Serbia’s participation in Helbroc is but a chard in a broader mosaic and should be assessed in conjunction with other significant steps which indicate the leadership’s determination to turn Serbia into a NATO member in all but the name, and perhaps ultimately in name as well. These steps have been the recent Platinum Wolf exercises, hosted partly on its soil by Serbia, with participation of units from NATO and NATO-associated countries, close military cooperation and procurement from NATO sources of weapons and military equipment, including helicopters and combat aircraft, signing in 2017 of the SOFA agreement granting NATO forces immunity on Serbian territory, and officer training in NATO member military schools. In the considered judgement of Col. Pecić, these activities in their totality reflect a purposeful design to bring the Armed Forces of Serbia closer to NATO and they indicate an undeviating process to ultimately integrate them into NATO structures. In light of these facts, which until quite recently were discretely concealed from the general public, official Serbia’s presence at NATO’s Summit ceases to astonish. Nor is there any reason to profess astonishment at recent revelations concerning the shipment of Serbian arms and munitions to the NATO-aligned Nazi junta in Ukraine. A treacherous pattern clearly has taken intelligible form and all the pieces of the unholy mosaic designed by renegades now fit naturally together. The only additional thing worth noting is that the stubborn unanimity the Serbian people have displayed in their support for Russia rests on a very solid foundation of fraternal attachment and gratitude. Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Russians have generously spilt their blood for Serbia. Even the Serbian puppet government under Nazi occupation had summoned the courage to categorically reject German demands to send at least a symbolic detachment of Serbian soldiers to the Eastern front, which was an invitation to commit moral suicide on behalf of the entire Serbian nation. Shockingly, all that has now been reversed. The use of Serbian military equipment in Ukraine has by now undoubtedly cost many Russian lives. But the Russian and international public need to understand that Serbia today is a mirror image of the broken Russia of the 1990s and that it is similarly governed by foreign agents who neither speak for the nation nor take its opinions into account. Enough said for all who have eyes to see and ears to hear. NATO war criminals and their Ukrainian Nazi minions may be a fitting social milieu for Serbia’s ruling clique. Maintaining cordial relations of any nature with them however leaves an unpardonable stain upon the honour of the Serbian people.",DISINFORMATION

Last weekend’s second round of elections in Moldova ended with a victory for incumbent pro-Western President Maia Sandu. With 90% of the votes counted, her leftist opponent Aleksandr Stoianoglo was in the lead, but the election was changed by the votes of the Moldovan diaspora living in the West. The results show that Sandu does not enjoy the confidence of Moldovan citizens at home. She received fewer votes than her opponent from people who actually live in the country. The outcomes of both rounds of the presidential election in Moldova, as well as the vote on the referendum on EU integration, took place in a context of severe pressure on the opposition, the use of administrative resources, cynical anti-Russian rhetoric and shameless interference in Moldova’s internal affairs by NATO states. Arbitrariness appeared in the form of a decision to reduce the number of polling stations on the territory of Russia. It is known that only two were opened, both in Moscow. And the number of ballot papers submitted to these polling stations was only 10,000. As a result, all Moldovan citizens who were not among these 10,000 were unable to vote. The number of polling stations on the territory of the self-governing Transnistrian Moldovan Republic was also reduced. From forty-four to thirty. And this became another important factor influencing the electoral process. We are talking about deliberate obstacles to the exercise of the right to vote placed in front of certain categories of Moldovan citizens – those who, from the point of view of Western curators, could pose a threat to Sandu’s chances. Of course, we cannot talk about democracy in this case, because the basic principles of democratic elections were violated. In fact, we are talking about discrimination on political and other grounds. But let’s get real: Western structures see what they want to see and don’t see what they don’t want to see. Therefore, all decisions of Western international observation cutouts are biased and show a biased position, which corresponds to the aims of the collective West. Violations during both the first and second rounds of the Moldovan presidential election went unnoticed. The Moldovan president is not the only key figure in the Moldovan political system, but in the current circumstances Sandu’s victory will lead to a further escalation of tensions in relations with Russia. This victory will be accompanied by increased information attacks and tensions in relations with Transnistria, and provocations against the southern Moldovan region of Gagauzia – which feels close to Moscow – are also possible. And Moldova is about to hold parliamentary elections that are likely to exacerbate its political crisis.

The remarks were extracts from an interview that Medvedev gave to Russian media, which he shared on social media on Thursday. “Where should we stop? I don’t know,” he said, adding that a lot of “serious work” lies ahead. “Will that be Kiev? Probably. This should be Kiev too. If not now, then sometime later. There are two reasons. Kiev is a Russian city, and a threat to the existence of the Russian Federation emanates from it,” he said. In a separate video, Medvedev addressed the southern Ukrainian port of Odessa, urging it to “return home.” “We in the Russian Federation have long been waiting for Odessa, if only because of its history and what kind of people live there and what language they speak. It is our Russian city,” he claimed. In May 2014, 42 pro-Russia supporters were burned to death in Odessa, a predominantly Russian-speaking city, having been trapped by a mob that supported the Western-backed protests in Kiev that would later overthrow the democratically elected government of Ukraine.

It follows from the draft, agreed during negotiations in Turkiye on April 15, 2022, that Moscow and Kiev reached an agreement on the basic conditions for ending the conflict, but there were some unresolved issues that were to be discussed personally by President Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky in the same month. That summit was never to take place. “Countless lives” could have been spared if this “advantageous” deal had been concluded, the outlet stated. Since the beginning of Russia’s special military operation, Ukraine’s military has lost almost 500,000 people, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu stated on April 23. Welt cited a member of the former Ukrainian negotiating team as calling it, in hindsight, “the best deal we could have had."" First of all, in line with Article 1 of the draft treaty, Ukraine committed itself to "" permanent neutrality."" Thus, Kiev was to abandon ambitions of membership in a military alliance, including NATO. The ensuing 13 sub-points of the first article outline the extensive definition of neutrality. Ukraine agreed never to ""receive, produce, or acquire nuclear weapons,"" not to allow foreign weapons or troops on its soil, and not to provide its military infrastructure, including airports and seaports, to any other country. Furthermore, in line with the draft, Kiev renounced holding military exercises with foreign participation and partaking in any military conflicts. However, EU membership for Kiev was explicitly not hindered, according to Article 3 of the document. Article 5 of the draft treaty had outlined comprehensive security guarantees that the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the US, UK, France, China, and Russia - could provide for Ukraine. In the event of a conflict, the guarantor states would commit to supporting Kiev’s self-defense within a maximum of three days, as enshrined in the UN Charter. This assistance could take the form of ""joint action"" by all or individual guarantor powers. According to Article 15, this treaty was supposed to be ratified in each signatory state to ensure legal validity. The article notes that one of the difficulties regarding this issue was the requirement for the consent of all guarantor states, which meant Russia could resort to a veto. At the same time, a number of Western states, including the US, UK, and France, promised support to Kiev, but refused to guarantee it. Regarding territorial issues, parts of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions of Donbass would remain under Russian control, the Welt-cited draft treaty stated, and Ukraine’s "" security guarantees"" would not extend to Crimea and the port of Sevastopol. The Donbass conflict erupted in April 2014 as a local counter-reaction to the West-sponsored Maidan coup in Kiev that toppled legitimate President Viktor Yanukovych in February. Residents of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions held independence referendums and proclaimed the People's Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The Crimean Peninsula and the federal city of Sevastopol became part of Russia after a referendum on March 16, 2014, in which the majority of residents voted to become part of the country. The future size of the Ukrainian Armed Forces remained unresolved, too. According to “Appendix 1,” Moscow ostensibly wanted Kiev to slash the size of its army to 85,000 people, while Ukraine insisted on retaining a strength of 250,000 . There were also disagreements over the amount of military equipment that should remain in the arsenal of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The publication noted that from Article 18 of the draft agreement it followed that the parties expected the presidents of the two countries to sign the deal in April 2022. However, after a ""promising"" summit in Istanbul, Moscow put forward subsequent demands, which Kiev did not agree to, the outlet said, adding that they were ""marked in italics in the document."" Russia demanded that Russian be made the second official language in Ukraine, that mutual sanctions be lifted, and lawsuits in international courts be stopped. Kiev was also to officially ban ""fascism, Nazism and aggressive nationalism,” the newspaper writes. One of the stated goals of Russia’s special military operation is de-Nazification of Ukraine. As for the Russian language, the day after the unconstitutional Western-sponsored coup in 2014, the new authorities repealed a law granting it official status in regions where it was native to at least 10 percent of the population. This was met with protests in the east of the country, where the Russian-speaking population predominated, especially in the Donbass. West Torpedoed Negotiations It is no secret that the West sabotaged any possible peace treaty between Russia and Ukraine. Last year, senior Ukrainian lawmaker David Arakhamia, the former chief negotiator with Russia, claimed in an interview with a Ukrainian TV channel that then UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was the one who convinced Kiev in 2022 not to negotiate with Moscow and carry on fighting instead. ""When we returned from Istanbul, Boris Johnson came to Kiev and said that we would not sign anything with [the Russians] at all. And [said] ‘let’s just continue fighting’,"" Arakhamia argued. The lawmaker also claimed that Ukraine rejected the ceasefire deal due to it contradicting the country’s constitution's clause on Kiev’s Euro-Atlantic aspirations. Efforts to achieve a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine were thwarted by Johnson at the behest of the United States, Russian Ambassador to the UK Andrey Kelin said in February, adding: ""He [Johnson] blocked the peace efforts with Washington's blessing, obviously, because he could not do it on his own accord. He arrived there, and the document, which had already been initialed by the head of the Ukrainian delegation, [David] Arakhamia, was thrown into the wastebasket, and Ukraine started fighting. These are the consequences of what the [former] prime minister of the United Kingdom did,"" Kelin said in an interview with Turkish broadcaster TRT World. In February, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated in an interview with American journalist Tucker Carlson that negotiations with Ukraine in 2022 were nearly finalized. However, after Russian troops withdrew from Kiev, the Ukrainian side disregarded all agreements and Zelensky went as far as prohibiting negotiations with Russia through a legislative decree. Putin has emphasized on numerous occasions that Moscow has never rejected negotiations, while also voicing uncertainty regarding whether the West wants a peaceful resolution to the Ukrainian conflict.",DISINFORMATION

His comments came after the German government warned that it faces a second consecutive year of recession in 2024. The EU gas market is seeing ‘demand destruction’, Miller told the St. Petersburg International Gas Forum on Thursday. The term refers to a situation in which persistently high prices or limited supply of a certain commodity lead to lower demand for it and trigger a search for alternatives. “Some [experts] say that [the situation] may be described as Europe’s energy suicide,” the head of the Russian state-run energy giant said. Others say that the “economic locomotive” has turned into “the sick man of Europe,” Miller added, in apparent reference to Germany. The EU’s largest economy contracted 0.3% last year, with the slowdown being attributed partly to a sharp drop in pipeline gas imports from Russia. Germany’s GDP is expected to decline by a further 0.2% this year, Berlin’s Ministry for Economic Affairs announced on Wednesday. That would mark the second straight year of recession for the country. Miller argued that the “deindustrialization of Europe” will continue, as well as increasing volatility in the gas market, warning that the trend could lead to “a new price shock for gas and supply disruptions.” According to the Gazprom chief, EU policies have resulted in a nearly 10% decline in industrial production in the bloc, to the lowest levels in a decade. European industry will not become more competitive, Miller argued, saying that industries in the US spend up to five times less on energy. The EU previously received the bulk of its Russian gas via the Nord Stream pipelines, but supplies stopped indefinitely after the under-sea infrastructure was damaged in a sabotage attack in September 2022. According to EU statistics, Russia’s share in EU gas supplies plunged from 45% in 2021 to 15% in 2023. Russian gas is currently delivered to Western and Central Europe via Ukraine, based on a contract signed by Gazprom and Naftogaz in 2019. Kiev, however, has said it has no intention of extending the agreement when it expires at the end of this year.",DISINFORMATION

While officials in Kiev insisted that this decision is related to the martial law imposed in the country since the escalation of the Ukrainian conflict in February 2022, speculation abounds that it may have something to do with Zelensky’s abysmal poll ratings. “He does not want to hold elections because he fears losing them and that someone else will take his place,” political analyst Bogdan Bezpalko, a member of the Russian Presidential Council for Interethnic Relations, told Sputnik. “Ukraine is not in a state of war, mobilization has not been officially declared, there are no other attributes associated with a country that is officially in a state of war. The martial law, of course, may allow him to extend his term but not indefinitely.” Russian envoy to the United Nations Vassily Nebenzya has already suggested that Zelensky will technically cease being a legitimate president once his term officially ends on May 21. Bezpalko, however, pointed out that Zelensky’s presidential term could be extended until August, not to mention that the regime in Kiev may try to stage some provocation in order to “change the judicial status of the conflict” and thus extend Zelensky’s term even further. The analyst added that Zelensky’s decision is unlikely to invite any repercussions from the West as long as the Kiev regime is deemed suitable to the Western powers’ interests. If, however, the West for some reason decides to oust Zelensky, the latter would be immediately lectured on democracy and told that he is no longer a legitimate president of Ukraine, Bezpalko suggested. While Western powers may issue “some timid statements” about Zelensky’s decision not to hold elections being “not very good,” they likely will not be followed by any sanctions or diminishing of the flow of Western assistance to Kiev, he added. “He may end up experiencing some difficulty in his contacts with the West but he will continue receiving aid – limited, significantly diminished perhaps, but he will keep getting aid,” Bezpalko remarked. According to him, the issue of Zelensky’s legitimacy is a secondary concern because his replacement would be unlikely to change Ukraine’s stance on relations with Russia or the whole conflict. The reason for this, he said, is the fact that it is not just Ukraine or Zelensky himself who are engaged in conflict with Russia – it is essentially the entire West versus Russia. Bezpalko also observed that Zelensky established an authoritarian regime in Ukraine by attempting to deny his political opponents access to mass media and any material resources. The fact that Zelensky bears responsibility for dragging Ukraine into a conflict that became an utter disaster for the country, with his name becoming synonymous with all the hardships that befell Ukrainians in recent months, would have ensured his defeat in a free and transparent election, Bezpalko surmised.",DISINFORMATION

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry intends to deny all consular services abroad to male citizens aged 18 to 60, except for preparing documents to return to Ukraine, local media reported on Monday, citing the ministry’s internal correspondence. The policy is presumably meant to force men of fighting age to leave foreign nations and be conscripted into military service under a new mobilization law signed by President Vladimir Zelensky this month. The people are being “erased by Western elites and their executors in Ukraine – Zelensky and his pseudo-Ukrainian gang,” Zakharova said on Tuesday, reacting to the news. She claimed that while Ukrainian governments that have been in power since the 2014 US-backed armed coup in Kiev posed as nationalist, their policies came “from people who historically had nothing to do with the country.” “After most of Ukraine was pillaged and looted, its history rewritten, and monuments destroyed, they moved on to the physical elimination of its indigenous population,” she said. ”Everything just like with the aboriginal population of North America, who were killed in the tens of thousands by the ‘civilized’ folk. They bought Manhattan Island for beads, and Ukrainians don’t even get those, only an American noose around the neck,” Zakharova added. Moscow perceives its conflict with Kiev as a proxy war which Washington initiated and is willing to conduct “to the last Ukrainian.” Senior Western officials, including US Senator Lindsey Graham and former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, have praised the Ukrainians’ willingness to fight and die for Western interests. ”There could be no more effective way of investing in Western security than investing in Ukraine, because those guys without a single pair of American boots on the ground are fighting for the West,” Johnson said earlier this month, as he bragged to students at Georgetown University in the US about his record of arming Kiev.",DISINFORMATION

Three years later, the bloc is facing its worst economic crisis since World War II, in no small measure thanks to the Biden administration’s policies. 2024-02-08T15:28+0000 2024-02-08T15:28+0000 2024-02-08T15:39+0000 economy joe biden donald trump christine lagarde business brussels russia germany european union (eu) deloitte EU officials are reportedly drawing up a contingency plan for Donald Trump’s return to power.An anonymous official familiar with the preparations told Bloomberg that the European Commission is working on an “impact assessment” of the consequences of a potential Trump win, based on the candidate’s threats to slap the bloc with a series of tough new trade-related restrictions designed to address the perceived unfair treatment of American businesses, and Brussels’ supposed softness on China.In response, Brussels is reportedly considering steps to try to assuage Trump’s hostility, including a “charm offensive” by senior officials reaching out to his team and expressing readiness to “work with” the Republican.But others seemed resigned to worsening ties, with German financial giant Deutsche Boerse warning that only “strong checks and balances” would be able to prevent Trump from making a pig’s breakfast of the transatlantic economic relationship.This sentiment was echoed by European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde last week.

Three years later, the bloc is facing its worst economic crisis since World War II, in no small measure thanks to the Biden administration’s policies. EU officials are reportedly drawing up a contingency plan for Donald Trump’s return to power. An anonymous official familiar with the preparations told Bloomberg that the European Commission is working on an “impact assessment” of the consequences of a potential Trump win, based on the candidate’s threats to slap the bloc with a series of tough new trade-related restrictions designed to address the perceived unfair treatment of American businesses, and Brussels’ supposed softness on China. The Trump team’s proposed measures include a 10 percent tariff on European goods, designed to boost US manufacturing, plus a response to European digital services taxes targeting American tech giants, and other measures meant to balance the lopsided trade relationship with the EU, with whom the US has had a deficit topping $200 billion for over three years running. In response, Brussels is reportedly considering steps to try to assuage Trump’s hostility, including a “charm offensive” by senior officials reaching out to his team and expressing readiness to “work with” the Republican. But others seemed resigned to worsening ties, with German financial giant Deutsche Boerse warning that only “strong checks and balances” would be able to prevent Trump from making a pig’s breakfast of the transatlantic economic relationship. This sentiment was echoed by European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde last week. Lagarde warned that Europe should prepare for “threats” to Europe’s economy if Trump returns to power. “Let us prepare for potential tariffs, for potential harsh decisions that would be unexpected. Let us be strong at home,” she urged, suggesting that Brussels could prepare for Trump’s comeback by more closely integrating its single market regime (which would further strip bloc members of any semblance of economic sovereignty).

If the general conditions remain the same, it is very likely that more companies will follow and more and more important parts of the value creation [stream] will migrate,” Deloitte partner Florian Ploner warned.

He also alleged that NATO is covertly using Brussels’ presence in the country to gain a foothold in the South Caucasus region. Last November, Yerevan signed off on an agreement stipulating the status of the EU mission on its border with Azerbaijan, which the Armenian parliament ratified in March 2024. Speaking to RIA Novosti on Friday, Galuzin said that Russia views “the EU mission’s activities in Armenia negatively.” “There is every reason to assume that Westerners are gathering intelligence on Russian facilities as well as all of Armenia’s neighbors,” the deputy foreign minister alleged. He pointed out that the EU mission personnel in Armenia are sending their reports directly to Brussels, apparently leaving even the host country in the dark about their contents. Russia has a military base in the Armenian city of Gyumri, located in the northwest of the country, not far from the Turkish border. The air force component of the Russian contingent is stationed in the capital, Yerevan. According to the diplomat, the EU is seeking to establish itself in the South Caucasus region to the detriment of such neighboring nations as Russia, Iran, and Türkiye. The official noted that Canadian representatives joined the mission back in April, despite the country not being a member of the EU. Given that Canada is part of NATO, Galuzin conjectured that its presence in Armenia de facto means that the US-led military bloc is attempting to increase its influence in the region. The deputy foreign minister expressed concern over the prospect of the EU mission becoming permanent even though it has not tangibly improved the tense situation on the Armenian-Azerbaijani border. According to the description on the mission’s website, it is “tasked with observing and reporting on the situation on the ground, contributing to human security in conflict-affected areas and supporting the confidence building between Armenia and Azerbaijan.” The initiative, which was launched at the Armenian government’s request, has a two-year mandate and includes observers from 23 EU member states and Canada. Last month, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan announced that his country would pull out of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) that comprises Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. Yerevan has repeatedly called the bloc’s usefulness into question, arguing that it failed to come to Armenia’s rescue during its military standoffs with Azerbaijan during the past four years over the long-disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. In September 2023, the Azerbaijani military conducted an offensive in the region that resulted in the dissolution of the self-declared Armenian breakaway state of Artsakh. Baku’s move was followed by a mass exodus of local militiamen and ethnic Armenians. The Kremlin insists that the Armenian government itself recognized Azerbaijani sovereignty over the territory.",DISINFORMATION

https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/us-and-uk-desire-to-conduct-a-proxy-war-doomed-ukraine/,https://www.rt.com/news/605759-uk-us-doomed-ukraine/,2024-10-20,"Secrets and Lies: This is how the West doomed Ukraine In February 2022, Russia started its military operation against Ukraine to impose a settlement after a group of NATO countries had undermined the Minsk II peace agreement for seven years. On the first day after the start of hostilities, Vladimir Zelensky confirmed that Moscow had contacted him to discuss negotiations based on restoring Ukrainian neutrality. On the third day, Russia and Ukraine agreed to start peace negotiations based on a Russian military withdrawal in return for this. Zelensky responded favorably to this condition, and he even called for a “collective security agreement” to include Russia to mitigate the security competition that had sparked the war. The talks that followed are referred to as the Istanbul negotiations, in which Russia and Ukraine were close to an agreement before the US and UK sabotaged it, according to numerous claims by people close to the process. Washington rejects negotiations without preconditions For Washington, there were great incentives to use the large proxy army it had built in Ukraine to weaken Russia as a strategic rival, rather than accepting a neutral Kiev. On the first day after the start of the military operation, when Zelensky responded favorably to starting negotiations without preconditions, US State Department spokesperson Ned Price rejected this stance – saying Russia would first have to withdraw all its forces. “Now we see Moscow suggesting that diplomacy take place at the barrel of a gun or as Moscow’s rockets, mortars, artillery target the Ukrainian people. This is not real diplomacy… If President Putin is serious about diplomacy, he knows what he can do. He should immediately stop the bombing campaign against civilians, order the withdrawal of his forces from Ukraine, and indicate very clearly, unambiguously to the world, that Moscow is prepared to de-escalate.” This was a demand for capitulation as the Russian military presence in Ukraine was Moscow’s bargaining chip to achieve the objective of restoring Kiev’s neutrality. Less than a month later, Price was asked if Washington would support peace talks, to which he replied negatively as the conflict was part of a larger struggle: “This is a war that is in many ways bigger than Russia, it’s bigger than Ukraine… The key point is that there are principles that are at stake here that have universal applicability everywhere, whether in Europe, whether in the Indo-Pacific, anywhere in between.” The US and UK demand a long war: Fighting Russia with Ukrainians In late March 2022, Zelensky revealed in an interview with The Economist that “there are those in the West who don’t mind a long war because it would mean exhausting Russia, even if this means the demise of Ukraine and comes at the cost of Ukrainian lives.” Israeli and Turkish mediators have since confirmed that Ukraine and Russia were both eager to make a compromise to end the war before the US and UK intervened to prevent peace from breaking out. Zelensky had contacted former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett to help with the talks. Bennett noted that Putin was willing to make “huge concessions” if Ukraine would restore its neutrality to end NATO expansion. Zelensky accepted this condition and “both sides very much wanted a ceasefire.” However, Bennett argued that the US and UK intervened and blocked the peace agreement as they favored a long war. With a powerful Ukrainian military at its disposal, the West rejected the Istanbul peace agreement and there was a “decision by the West to keep striking Putin” instead of pursuing peace. The Turkish negotiators reached the same conclusion: Russia and Ukraine agreed to resolve the conflict by restoring Ukraine’s neutrality, but NATO decided to fight Russia with Ukrainians as a proxy. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu argued that some NATO states wanted to extend the war to bleed Russia: “After the talks in Istanbul, we did not think that the war would take this long… But following the NATO foreign ministers’ meeting, I had the impression that there are those within the NATO member states that want the war to continue – let the war continue and Russia gets weaker. They don’t care much about the situation in Ukraine.” Numan Kurtulmus, the deputy chairman of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s political party, confirmed that Zelensky was ready to sign the peace agreement before the US intervened: “This war is not between Russia and Ukraine, it is a war between Russia and the West. By supporting Ukraine, the United States and some countries in Europe are beginning a process of prolonging this war. What we want is an end to this war. Someone is trying not to end the war. The US sees the prolongation of the war as its interest.” Ukrainian Ambassador Aleksandr Chalyi, who participated in peace talks with Russia, confirms that Putin “tried everything” to reach a peace agreement and they were able “to find a very real compromise.” David Arakhamia, a Ukrainian parliamentary representative and head of Zelensky’s political party, said Russia’s key demand was Ukrainian neutrality. “They were ready to end the war if we, like Finland once did, would accept neutrality and pledge not to join NATO. In fact, that was the main point. All the rest are cosmetic and political ‘additions.’” Aleksey Arestovich, the former adviser of Zelensky, also confirmed that Russia was mainly preoccupied with restoring Ukraine’s neutrality. The main obstacle to peace was thus overcome as Zelensky offered neutrality in the negotiations. The tentative peace agreement was confirmed by Fiona Hill, a former official at the US National Security Council, and Angela Stent, a former National Intelligence Officer for Russia and Eurasia. Hill and Stent penned an article in Foreign Affairs in which they outlined the main terms of the agreement: “Russian and Ukrainian negotiators appeared to have tentatively agreed on the outlines of a negotiated interim settlement: Russia would withdraw to its position on February 23, when it controlled part of the Donbas region and all of Crimea, and in exchange, Ukraine would promise not to seek NATO membership and instead receive security guarantees from a number of countries.” Boris Johnson goes to Kiev What happened to the Istanbul peace agreement? On April 9, 2022, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson went to Kiev in a rush to sabotage the agreement and cited the killings in Bucha as the excuse. Ukrainian media reported that Johnson went to Kiev with two messages: “The first is that Putin is a war criminal, he should be pressured, not negotiated with. And the second is that even if Ukraine is ready to sign some agreements on guarantees with Putin, they [the UK and US] are not.” In June 2022, Johnson told the G7 and NATO that the solution to the war was “strategic endurance” and “now is not the time to settle and encourage the Ukrainians to settle for a bad peace.” Johnson also published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal arguing against any negotiations. “The war in Ukraine can end only with Vladimir Putin’s defeat.” Before Johnson’s trip to Kiev, historian Niall Ferguson interviewed several American and British leaders who confirmed that a decision had been made for “the conflict to be extended and thereby bleed Putin,” as “the only end game now is the end of Putin regime.” Retired German General Harald Kujat, the former head of the German Bundeswehr and former chairman of the NATO Military Committee, confirmed that Johnson had sabotaged the peace negotiations. Kujat said: “Ukraine had pledged to renounce NATO membership and not to allow any foreign troops or military installations to be stationed,” while “Russia had apparently agreed to withdraw its forces to the level of February 23.” However, “Boris Johnson intervened in Kiev on the 9th of April and prevented a signing. His reasoning was that the West was not ready for an end to the war.” According to Kujat, the West demanded a Russian capitulation. “Now the complete withdrawal is repeatedly demanded as a prerequisite for negotiations.” He explained that this position was due to the US war plans against Russia: “Perhaps one day the question will be asked who did not want to prevent this war… Their declared goal is to weaken Russia politically, economically, and militarily to such a degree that they can then turn to their geopolitical rival, the only one capable of endangering their supremacy as a world power: China… No, this war is not about our freedom… Russia wants to prevent its geopolitical rival USA from gaining a strategic superiority that threatens Russia’s security.” What was Ukraine told by the US and UK? Why did Zelensky make a deal given that he was aware some Western states wanted to use Ukraine to exhaust Russia in a long war – even if it would destroy Ukraine? Zelensky likely received an offer he could not refuse: If Zelensky would pursue peace with Russia, then he would not receive any support from the West and he would predictably face an uprising by the far-right / fascist groups that the US had armed and trained. In contrast, if Zelensky would choose war, then NATO would send all the weapons needed to defeat Russia, NATO would impose crippling sanctions on Russia, and NATO would pressure the international community to isolate Russia. Zelensky could thus achieve what both Napoleon and Hitler had failed to achieve – to defeat Russia. Arestovich explained in 2019 that a major war with Russia was the price of joining NATO. He predicted that the threat of Ukraine’s accession to NATO would “provoke Russia to launch a large-scale military operation against Ukraine,” and Ukraine could join NATO after defeating Russia. Victory over Russia was assumed to be a certainty as Ukraine would merely be the spearhead of a wider NATO proxy war. “In this conflict, we will be very actively supported by the West – with weapons, equipment, assistance, new sanctions against Russia and the quite possible introduction of a NATO contingent, a no-fly zone etc. We won’t lose, and that’s good.” NATO turned on the propaganda machine to convince the public that a war against Russia was the only path to peace. The Russian ‘invasion’ was “unprovoked”; Moscow’s objective was to conquer all of Ukraine to restore the Soviet Union; Russia’s withdrawal from Kiev was not a sign of good will to be reciprocated but a sign of weakness; it was impossible to negotiate with Putin; and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg subsequently asserted that “weapons are the way to peace.” The Western public, indoctrinated with anti-Russian propaganda over decades, believed that NATO was merely a passive third party seeking to protect Ukraine from the most recent reincarnation of Hitler. Zelensky was assigned the role as new Churchill – bravely fighting to the last Ukrainian rather than accepting a bad peace. The inevitable Istanbul+ agreement to end the war The war did not go as expected. Russia built a powerful army and defeated the NATO-built Ukrainian army. Sanctions were overcome by reorienting the economy to the East, and instead of being isolated, Russia took a leading role in constructing a multipolar world order. How can the war be brought to an end? The suggestions of a land-for-NATO membership agreement ignores that Russia’s leading objective is not territory but ending NATO expansion, as it is deemed to be an existential threat. NATO expansion is the source of the conflict and territorial dispute is the consequence, thus Ukrainian territorial concessions in return for NATO membership is a non-starter. The foundation for any peace agreement must be the Istanbul+ formula. An agreement to restore Ukraine’s neutrality, plus territorial concessions as a consequence of almost three years of war. Threatening to expand NATO after the end of the war will merely incentivize Russia to capture strategic territory from Kharkov to Odessa, and to ensure that only a dysfunctional Ukrainian rump state will remain that is not capable of being used against Russia. This is a cruel fate for the Ukrainian nation and the millions of Ukrainians who have suffered so greatly. It was also a predictable outcome, as Zelensky cautioned in March 2022. “There are those in the West who don’t mind a long war because it would mean exhausting Russia, even if this means the demise of Ukraine and comes at the cost of Ukrainian lives.” This piece was first published on Glenn Diesen’s Substack and edited by the RT team.",DISINFORMATION

Completed in 2012, for almost a decade the pipeline provided Russian natural gas to Western Europe. Although the United States expressed unease over the act of cooperation between Russia and its European allies, the Nord Stream played a crucial role in fueling German industry and providing low-cost energy throughout the continent.Observers immediately blamed the United States for the act of industrial sabotage, pointing to US President Joe Biden’s cryptic promise to “bring an end” to the project if Russia moved to intervene in Ukraine’s attacks on the ethnically Russian Donbass region. Denmark’s inquiry indeed found the explosions were an act of “deliberate sabotage,” although Danish officials refused to investigate who bore responsibility.Investigative journalist Dan Lazare joined Sputnik’s The Critical Hour program on Wednesday to comment on the US ally’s report.“And the reason, of course, is the likeliest culprit – in fact, I'm 100% convinced that it is the culprit – is the United States,” he claimed. “But, Denmark, Sweden, everybody is afraid to say it. It's extraordinary.”“The man or woman on the street knows perfectly well who did this, but the liberal centrist parties try to bottle it up, try to deny reality,” he explained. “Which means that the only parties talking about it [are] other parties, the populist parties on the far-right, like the Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) in Germany. And the AfD actually is riding this issue rather hard.”“So if the AfD is climbing in the polls they have Joe Biden to thank because Joe Biden blew the pipeline up, and everyone's afraid to admit it,” Lazare concluded.The Alternative for Deutschland is one of a number of rightwing forces currently enjoying increased support in the West amidst economic hardship and the political establishment’s increasingly unpopular support for Ukraine’s proxy war against Russia. Lazare lists a number of figures benefitting from the phenomenon, including Donald Trump in the US, Marine Le Pen in France, Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, and Giorgia Meloni in Italy.But Lazare insisted that liberal political parties are not the only institutions likely to be damaged by the explosive reality of the Nord Stream disaster.“The US engaged in an act of war against a fellow NATO member,” he claimed bluntly. “NATO members aren't supposed to engage in war against one another. They're supposed to guard against attacks by outsiders.”Lazare claimed “the political consequences would have been earth-shaking” if leaders publicly acknowledged the United States’ responsibility for the Nord Stream sabotage.NATO has already suffered various strains as the alliance has expanded into Eastern Europe, most recently with Turkiye and Hungary delaying Sweden’s accession to the bloc. Slovakia’s Prime Minister Robert Fico has also questioned the alliance’s direction in the past week, criticizing French President Emmanuel Macron’s suggestion that European troops should be sent to aid Ukraine in the Donbass.But NATO has always been dominated by the United States, a reality demonstrated by the fact that every Supreme Allied Commander of the bloc has been American. Nationalist French President Charles de Gaulle recognized as much when he famously refused to place French troops under the alliance’s command.European leaders have historically been content to tolerate the arrangement in exchange for promised military protection from America. But the United States may have finally taken things too far with its dramatic commandeering of the continent’s energy policy as well.

In September 2022 a series of explosions disabled both branches of the Nord Stream pipeline between Russia and Germany. Completed in 2012, for almost a decade the pipeline provided Russian natural gas to Western Europe. Although the United States expressed unease over the act of cooperation between Russia and its European allies, the Nord Stream played a crucial role in fueling German industry and providing low-cost energy throughout the continent. Observers immediately blamed the United States for the act of industrial sabotage, pointing to US President Joe Biden’s cryptic promise to “bring an end” to the project if Russia moved to intervene in Ukraine’s attacks on the ethnically Russian Donbass region. Denmark’s inquiry indeed found the explosions were an act of “deliberate sabotage,” although Danish officials refused to investigate who bore responsibility. Investigative journalist Dan Lazare joined Sputnik’s The Critical Hour program on Wednesday to comment on the US ally’s report. “It's just absolutely farcical,” said the iconoclastic author. “I don't know how much longer this can go on. I mean, Denmark investigated, came up with a conclusion, and everybody knows it was obviously sabotage – that was obvious from the very start. And [Denmark] refrains from pointing a finger at a likely culprit.” “And the reason, of course, is the likeliest culprit – in fact, I'm 100% convinced that it is the culprit – is the United States,” he claimed. “But, Denmark, Sweden, everybody is afraid to say it. It's extraordinary.” Sweden, likewise a US ally, ended its own investigation into the Nord Stream disaster earlier this month, also without commenting on the culprit of the sabotage. Lazare said the United States’ guilt is obvious, but frequently ignored in order to safeguard relations between the US and Europe. That dynamic is playing to the benefit of far-right parties across the continent who are the only ones willing to openly acknowledge the US role in the act, according to Lazare. “The man or woman on the street knows perfectly well who did this, but the liberal centrist parties try to bottle it up, try to deny reality,” he explained. “Which means that the only parties talking about it [are] other parties, the populist parties on the far-right, like the Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) in Germany. And the AfD actually is riding this issue rather hard.” “So if the AfD is climbing in the polls they have Joe Biden to thank because Joe Biden blew the pipeline up, and everyone's afraid to admit it,” Lazare concluded. The Alternative for Deutschland is one of a number of rightwing forces currently enjoying increased support in the West amidst economic hardship and the political establishment’s increasingly unpopular support for Ukraine’s proxy war against Russia. Lazare lists a number of figures benefitting from the phenomenon, including Donald Trump in the US, Marine Le Pen in France, Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, and Giorgia Meloni in Italy. “The center is self-destructing and virtually now ushering in the far-right to take its place,” he said, claiming establishment lawmakers “are going to pay a terrible, terrible price for covering this [Nord Stream sabotage] up.” But Lazare insisted that liberal political parties are not the only institutions likely to be damaged by the explosive reality of the Nord Stream disaster. “The US engaged in an act of war against a fellow NATO member,” he claimed bluntly. “NATO members aren't supposed to engage in war against one another. They're supposed to guard against attacks by outsiders.” Lazare claimed “the political consequences would have been earth-shaking” if leaders publicly acknowledged the United States’ responsibility for the Nord Stream sabotage. “Once people admit what happened, NATO essentially goes up in air because an alliance is not a scheme for one member to attack another,” he claimed. “It's a mutual defense pact, and the US violated it in spades. This Nord Stream [sabotage] is an event that will resonate for decades. It is an explosion of the heart of the Western alliance – it will completely destroy the Western alliance. There is no way that NATO can survive this blow once it becomes too big to ignore.” NATO has already suffered various strains as the alliance has expanded into Eastern Europe, most recently with Turkiye and Hungary delaying Sweden’s accession to the bloc. Slovakia’s Prime Minister Robert Fico has also questioned the alliance’s direction in the past week, criticizing French President Emmanuel Macron’s suggestion that European troops should be sent to aid Ukraine in the Donbass. But NATO has always been dominated by the United States, a reality demonstrated by the fact that every Supreme Allied Commander of the bloc has been American. Nationalist French President Charles de Gaulle recognized as much when he famously refused to place French troops under the alliance’s command. European leaders have historically been content to tolerate the arrangement in exchange for promised military protection from America. But the United States may have finally taken things too far with its dramatic commandeering of the continent’s energy policy as well. Time will tell if Europe produces leaders finally willing to declare their countries’ independence.",DISINFORMATION

The attempts by Ukraine to target nuclear facilities inside Russia are “beyond reckless” and could end up plunging the European continent “into a radiation nightmare,” Nebenzia warned during an unofficial meeting of the UN Security Council on Friday. The authorities in Moscow “have credible information that Western intelligence agencies, primarily the British MI6, have systematically prepared Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance groups to organize provocations at nuclear power plants in Russia.” Among other schemes, Kiev and its foreign backers were working on an operation to blow up power lines connecting the nuclear plants with the Russian national energy grid, the envoy stressed. He recalled how throughout the conflict, “representatives of certain countries” had accused Moscow, “contrary to common sense, of destabilizing the security situation around the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), which is under our control.” The facility was secured by Russian troops in March 2022. According to Nebenzia, those making such claims “do their best to ignore the obvious fact that regular and reckless attacks against the ZNPP are a deliberate terrorist strategy of Ukraine.” Moscow and Kiev have repeatedly accused each other of shelling Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, and the Russian Defense Ministry has said that several attempts by Ukrainian assault units to retake it have been repelled. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has confirmed attacks on the ZNPP, but declined to name the responsible party. ""But recent events undermine the arguments of all those who try to shelter the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the case of the ZNPP,” the envoy said, referring to Kiev’s incursion into Russia’s Kursk Region, which began in early August. ""There is irrefutable evidence that Kiev was also plotting to attack the Nuclear Power Plant in Kursk,” with the Ukrainians planning to capture and mine the facility, he stressed. It is fortunate that the Russian military prevented the Ukrainian forces from reaching the nuclear plant, thus averting a “genuine man-made disaster and a large-scale technogenic catastrophe in Europe,” Nebenzia said. The Russian envoy has once again called upon international bodies, including the UN and the IAEA, to condemn the “provocative actions” by Ukraine and prevent further attempts to undermine the security of the nuclear sites in Zaporozhye and Kursk.",DISINFORMATION

Moldova’s recent presidential elections may well be considered the most bizarre and controversial in the country’s history. This has nothing to do with the fact that Moldova’s incumbent president, Maia Sandu, has been reelected; rather, the main issue is how the votes were counted. Manipulating votes On October 30, former Moldovan president and leader of the Party of Socialists, Igor Dodon, claimed that Sandu intended to rig the election because she had little chance of winning. He further alleged that she could manipulate the outcome using more than 200 polling stations that were located in Western countries. In the end, Sandu received nearly 83% of the votes cast at foreign polling stations, so it’s no coincidence that the Moldovan opposition labeled her “the president of the diaspora.” By contrast, her main rival, Alexandr Stoianoglo, secured the majority of votes (over 51%) in Moldova itself. Interestingly, even in Sandu’s hometown of Falesti, voters chose Stoianoglo over their local candidate. It is also important to note that Sandu’s victory abroad was only possible because of the Moldovan government’s deliberate disenfranchisement of expatriates who were expected to vote against her, including hundreds of thousands of Moldovans residing in Russia. The largest Moldovan diaspora resides in Russia, not in neighboring Romania or elsewhere in Europe. For the nearly half-a-million Moldovans living in Russia, only two polling stations were set up in Moscow, and just 10,000 ballots were provided. Moscow recorded the highest voter turnout of any overseas location, but, predictably, ballots ran out before voting ended. Even hours after the polls closed, people remained at the Moldovan embassy, hoping for a chance to cast their votes. Many expressed frustration that the voting process had been intentionally drawn out. Some Moldovans living in Russia flew abroad, to cities like Minsk (Belarus), Baku (Azerbaijan), and Istanbul (Türkiye), to vote at the Moldovan embassies there, since they couldn’t travel to Moldova. A record 320,000 voters cast their ballots at overseas polling stations – which is an all-time high in the history of Moldovan elections. By denying Moldovan citizens who reside in Russia the right to vote, Sandu focused on Moldovans who had migrated to the West, regardless of whether or not they ever planned to return home. After the election, Sandu spoke of “unity” and pledged to be a “president for all Moldovans” which, in the given circumstances, sounds rather dubious. The road to a “European Future” Throughout her campaign, Sandu used a number of other grandiose slogans. Before the first round of elections, her slogan was “For Moldova!” and in the second round, it changed to “Let’s save the country!” However, Sandu did not clarify whom she intended to save the country from, considering the fact that she had been in power for the past four years and her allies hold all the key government posts. The parliament is also dominated by her Action and Solidarity Party, which forms the majority in the government. During Sandu’s presidency, the situation in the country hasn’t improved and has even become worse. Ignoring Moldova’s pressing issues, she seemed more focused on pleasing the West. Sandu is proud that, due to her efforts, Moldova became a candidate for EU membership in 2022. Yet officials in Brussels refuse to provide a timeline for when Moldova might become a full member. When Sandu ran for president four years ago, she vowed to tackle domestic issues like poverty, corruption, and implement reforms. In reality, things turned out differently. By pursuing a hardline policy of Romanianization, Sandu appears to prioritize Bucharest’s interests over those of Chisinau, which is often noted by her opponents. This is hardly surprising, given the fact that she holds a Romanian passport. She was also the one who replaced the term “Moldovan language” with “Romanian language” in Moldova’s legislation, including the in the constitution. This decision sparked discontent among ethnic Moldovans who do not identify with Romania, as well as national minorities, particularly the Gagauz people, whose concerns Chisinau largely ignores. Transnistria, which foresaw all this back in the early 1990s and chose the path of self-determination, also reacted to these developments in a negative way. The socio-economic situation in Moldova has consistently worsened over the years and remains dire. Polls show that Sandu, who has blamed her predecessors for the country’s troubles, has only made life worse for Moldovans. Just weeks before the first round of elections, her disapproval rating soared above 60%. Negative sentiments toward the current president aren’t limited to the residents of Transnistria or Gagauzia; they extend to many Moldovans, except for those who support European integration and the prospect of reunification with Romania, naively believing that their lives will dramatically improve after they join the EU. What Sandu fails to mention is that in Romania itself, life hasn’t significantly improved after it joined the EU. Romania is the poorest country in Europe, with a staggering 34.4% of its population classified as “insolvent,” and it has the highest proportion of people at risk of poverty in the EU. Romania’s current population is around 18 million (down from approximately 23 million in 1989, when Nicolae Ceausescu was overthrown and the communist regime ended), despite the influx of Moldovans and Ukrainians who have relocated there. Romanians themselves continue to emigrate to countries like Italy, Britain, and Germany in search of a better life. In the early 2000s, Romania’s economy was quite promising and even experienced growth, benefiting from a balance between cooperation with the EU and stable trade relations with Russia. Economic development was fueled by both investment and trade preferences within the European Union, as well as exports to Russia and Eastern Europe. Trade ties with Russia were particularly important for Romania, especially in the fields of energy and agriculture, with Moscow being the main supplier of gas and other resources essential for Romania’s energy sector. In return, Romania exported agricultural products, machinery, and chemicals to Russia, providing a stable market for Romanian producers and bolstering agricultural growth. Romania’s economic progress relied heavily on balancing its relations with the EU and Russia. This strategy allowed the country to modernize its economy, enhance its export potential, and reduce its vulnerability to crises. However, Romania’s inconsistent behavior and a lack of a pragmatic strategy in regard to Moscow have ultimately backfired. Other “achievements” of the president’s team Returning to Moldova, due to measures that Sandu has implemented – which were supposedly aimed at economic recovery and development – food and basic commodity prices in the country soared by 65-70% in the past four years. The cost of medication has also increased, yet citizens have not seen the promised rises in wages, pensions, or social benefits that Sandu vowed to deliver. Another step that characterizes Sandu’s policy is her decision to block amendments to the Law on Internal Trade, which would have required retailers to stock at least 50% of local products. Local farmers had hoped that the government would protect them and prioritize local production over imported goods in order to preserve jobs and promote wage growth in Moldova. However, under pressure from the EU, Sandu rejected the law since it would create challenges for foreign producers that flooded Moldova’s market with their products. In the past three years, the safety situation in Moldova has become worse, and people feel less safe. People have been abducted in the middle of the day in Chisinau and other cities; gangs rob passengers at airports and bus stations; elderly people have gone missing, and incidents of violence have surged. Meanwhile, law enforcement is too weak to handle these issues. One of Sandu’s first actions as president was to sign an agreement with the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, which granted foreigners access to state secrets. Under the guise of combating money laundering, Sandu took drastic measures that negatively impacted the lives of ordinary Moldovans. Despite the fact that hundreds of thousands of Moldovan citizens work in Russia, this year Chisinau decided to shut down the Zolotaya Korona payment system – the last remaining way to send money from Russia to Moldova. As police reports indicate, tens of millions of dollars were still smuggled into the country during September and October, suggesting that disabling the service had done little to help. However, it did anger ordinary people who received financial support from relatives in Russia. Moreover, Sandu has tightened regulations in the financial sector, which affected Moldovan expatriates living in Western Europe. Now, in order to buy an apartment or even a car in Moldova, one needs to show proof of the source of funds. It’s clear that very few migrants who have saved money abroad over the years can provide such receipts. Sad outcomes and even sadder prospects All these factors contribute to the growing discontent among ordinary Moldovans who see that the EU flag is just an attractive facade, and in reality, Sandu doesn’t take any steps to improve life in the country. Meanwhile, anyone who criticizes Sandu is hastily labeled a Kremlin agent, pro-Moscow, or “pro-Russian.” This happened to Sandu’s main opponent in the runoff, Alexandr Stoianoglo, the former prosecutor and a Gagauz by ethnicity. Forgetting her status as president and the political correctness that this post implies, Sandu called Stoianoglo a “Trojan horse” simply because he expressed a desire to improve relations with Russia if he were elected. His pragmatic statements and commitment to prioritize Moldovan interests resonated with many citizens. He even offered to negotiate with Russian President Vladimir Putin to lower gas prices, which would significantly ease the burden on the population, while promising to remain apolitical and end divisions within Moldova. In contrast, Sandu’s approach seems to be about framing Western interests as Moldovan ones, insisting that there can’t be any “Moldovan interests” unless they align with the West – otherwise, you’re labeled a Russian agent. It’s hard to expect much from a politician who holds the passport of another country and refuses to acknowledge the existence of the Moldovan language, preferring to call it Romanian instead. In Moldova, there is growing discontent with Sandu’s administration. While she once praised her administration’s performance, now she promises to reshuffle personnel. Sandu and her team are definitely aware that, even though they won the elections, a significant portion of the Moldovan population did not vote for her. This means that no proposed benefits or promises to improve the lives of Moldovans will make her a true “people’s president.” Even those people who voted for Sandu now actively discuss the legitimacy of her victory on Moldovan social media networks. Nicolae Panfil, head of Promo-LEX Association, reported 316 violations during the presidential elections. The majority of them were related to breaches of voting secrecy, discrepancies in voter lists, and technical issues. There were also incidents of unauthorized individuals being present at polling stations and reports of ballot boxes being tampered with. According to Promo-LEX, at polling stations in Italy, Spain, and Germany “individuals monitored the arrival of voters outside the polling stations,” which raised concerns about the intentions of these individuals. Meanwhile, the Central Electoral Commission of Moldova claimed that “no serious violations were recorded” during the runoff, asserting that the “elections took place in a free environment and without major incidents.” Stoianoglo ultimately acknowledged his defeat, describing Sandu’s victory as weak and artificial. He criticized the current leadership for the “inability to either lose or win in a dignified manner.” Did Stoianoglo have any other options? Sure, he could have rallied his supporters and staged a revolution – such tactics aren’t new to Moldova or neighboring Ukraine. However, unlike Sandu, Stoianoglo showed that he cares for his country and does not wish to plunge it into chaos and anarchy. Some may view this as a sign of weakness or a lack of resolve in a political leader. Yet, reading this article attentively, you’ll see that life in Moldova is already quite challenging, and a revolution would only exacerbate the problems, potentially jeopardizing the very existence of the nation. Any responsible politician who is aware of the situation would refrain from taking such steps. As to whether Sandu qualifies as a responsible politician, that’s a question everyone can answer for themselves.",DISINFORMATION

In a wide-ranging and highly anticipated interview that lasted more than two hours, Putin described in detail the process by which Ukraine was created in its current form. He recalled that, during the feudal fragmentation of Russia in the Middle Ages, Ukraine – which he described as being part of Russian lands – came under heavy Polish cultural, religious, and political influence. In the 17th century, the people of this region wanted to join the then-growing power of Moscow, but Russia wanted to avoid war with Poland. Nevertheless, after a lot of deliberation, Moscow decided to bring this “part of old Russian lands” back into the fold, he said, which resulted in a war with Poland. Moscow reclaimed all of its “historic lands” during the reign of Catherine the Great, who ruled between 1762 and 1796, he recalled. After the 1917 Communist Revolution in Russia and another war with Poland, Warsaw regained control over large swaths of western Ukraine, Putin continued. In the 1920s, the Bolshevik government established a Soviet Ukraine that “had never existed before.” The Soviet authorities were “Ukrainizing” this region, in line with similar indigenization policies pursued in other areas, the president said. “After the Second World War, Ukraine, in addition to the territories that had belonged to Poland, received part of the territories that had previously belonged to Hungary and Romania… So, we have every reason to affirm that Ukraine is an artificial state that was shaped at Stalin’s will.” Putin added that these nations in principle have the right to discuss the return of their former territories, but denied that he had ever discussed the matter with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. However, he suggested that Hungarians living in Ukraine want to “get back to their historic land.”",DISINFORMATION

According to the outlet, there is growing criticism towards Zelensky in Ukraine for maintaining “unrealistic hopes of total victory,” including the return of all former Ukrainian territories. Zelensky’s roadmap to resolve the crisis, which he has been promoting since 2022, calls for a complete and unconditional withdrawal of Russian forces from all territories within Ukraine’s 1991 borders, for Moscow to pay reparations, and for a war crimes tribunal to be held. Moscow has described Zelensky’s ‘peace formula’ as an “absolutely hollow” ultimatum that is “divorced from reality.” Even senior officials in Ukraine privately give a more cautious definition of victory, the article noted. “Publicly, I support what the president says,” the report cited one of the officials as saying. “Unpublicly, I think we should survive as an independent western state that has the possibility of development.” The outlet also pointed to growing anger in the country towards the West “for not doing enough, fast enough” for Ukraine. A government minister told the outlet that the US Congress “will never be forgiven by the Ukrainian people” for the “endless” delays in voting on the latest round of military aid. There is also growing discontent with Zelensky’s performance; his presidential term expired on May 20, raising questions over his legitimacy as head of state, according to the report. Several separate sources told the outlet that Zelensky “obsessively” studies his ratings, which continue to drop. Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that Moscow is ready to engage in peace negotiations with Ukraine. However, any future agreement “will have to take into account the realities on the ground,” he said.",DISINFORMATION

It's the military industrial complex writ large.” US weapons manufacturers maintain influence in Washington not just by contributing to lawmakers, but by funding some of the country’s most important institutions. A study last year by the Quincy Institute found that of the 15 think tanks mentioned most often in America’s major newspapers in relation to coverage of Ukraine, 14 of them receive funding from US military contractors. Think tanks with defense industry funding were found to be seven times more likely to be cited than those without, according to the study. “That there is guilt by omission,” said McGovern of US media’s coverage of the so-called Russiagate scandal. “Do Americans know that over six years ago it was published that the head of the cyber firm investigating the [alleged] DNC hack, so to speak, by the Russians testified under oath – this fellow's name is Shawn Henry, the firm is CrowdStrike – that there was no technical evidence that Russia or anyone else hacked into the Democratic National Committee? Sworn testimony under oath.” “It has not appeared in the New York Times, so most people are blissfully unaware that this thing has been disproven.” In 1977, investigative journalist Carl Bernstein revealed the CIA’s Operation Mockingbird to the American public. US intelligence, the reporter demonstrated, had cultivated assets in mainstream media for decades, allowing it to shape coverage at outlets such as the Associated Press, CBS and The New York Times. Although the CIA is legally forbidden from operating on American soil, the agency faced no consequences from the revelation.28 December 2023, 23:37 GMT The incident would be quickly swept under the rug, and by 1981 the CIA had a strong ally in the executive branch with the ascension of former CIA director George H.W. Bush to the vice presidency. US Senator Chuck Schumer once cautioned former President Donald Trump about the power of US intelligence agencies. “Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday of getting back at you,” the lawmaker warned. Years later it was revealed the CIA had spied on Trump’s campaign: another illegal abuse that, predictably, was met with no consequence.",DISINFORMATION

Home to the Sudzha gas metering station, the town is the only currently operational route for the transit of Russian gas to Europe via Ukraine. Sputnik asked a Slovak lawmaker what's behind the provocation. There are two keyreasons behind the Kiev regime’s brazen incursion into Russia’s Kursk region and attempts to shell and capture the Sudzha gas metering station, Slovakian MEP Milan Uhrik has told Sputnik. “The first reason is the proximity of the region and the Ukrainian regime’s need to show its Western sponsors some successes on the battlefield,” Uhrik, leader of the Republika Movement, explained. “The second goal is to destabilize countries that buy cheap raw materials from Russia and at the same time do not want to supply weapons to the conflict,” the politician suggested, referring to Slovakia and Hungary, whose respective leaderships have steadily opposed the transfer of arms to Kiev, and continued to purchase Russian oil and gas supplies transiting through Ukraine to ensure their energy security. “The second idea did not have to be born in the minds of representatives of the Ukrainian regime. I think it was invented by the same people…behind the destruction of the Nord Stream II gas pipeline,” Uhrik emphasized, referring to the September 2022 Nord Stream pipeline sabotage attack – which damaged three of the network’s four lines and stripped Central Europe of a key source of reliable and cheap Russian energy. In an explosive expose in 2023 based on testimony from a reliable source, veteran US investigative journalist Seymour Hersh revealed that Nord Stream was sabotaged by US Navy divers in coordination with the Norwegian Navy under the cover of Baltic Sea drills. Russia's Gazprom pumped nearly 15 billion cubic meters of natural gas via the pipeline running through Sudzha in Kursk region west through Ukraine in 2023, accounting for roughly 4.5% of the EU’s total gas consumption. The route serves Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Italy, with three former nations landlocked and finding it impossible to meet the European Union's directives for weaning themselves off Russian energy supplies. The attack on Kursk region is Kiev's second energy-related provocation targeting Slovakia and Hungary in recent weeks. In July, Bratislava and Budapest got into a diplomatic flap with Kiev after the latter blocked the transit of oil supplies via Ukraine being delivered by Russian oil giant Lukoil. Slovakia and Hungary appealed to Brussels for support, but didn't get it, prompting Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto to accuse the European Union of ""coordinating"" Kiev's actions. A Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson charged the US ""deep state"" with trying to drive the EU into ""total dependence on US energy resources"" by cutting off access to Russian supplies. “A sovereign government would use all its diplomatic weight to ensure that its energy security is not compromised. A sovereign government would not support such a regime that works directly against its interests and the interests of its citizens. We will see which government will have the courage to act sovereignly,” Uhrik said, when asked what kind of reaction he expects from Slovakia and Hungary’s authorities. The Ukrainian military began a large-scale surprise incursion into Russia's Kursk region on August 6, sending as many as 10,000 troops and 600 armored vehicles into the area, sparking off fierce battles with Russian forces.

The first holds a grudge against Russia because of its great ambitions, and the second - because of defeats in Africa. A lot has already been said about the crash of the Il-76 aircraft carrying captured Ukrainian soldiers in the Belgorod region. It was established that the two missiles that hit the military transport vehicle were launched from the Kiev-controlled territory of the Kharkiv region. As a result of the plane crash, all the prisoners on board were killed. Of course, this did not go unnoticed by the public. The internal confrontation in both the West and Ukraine has only intensified, and to a greater extent due to the fact that the United States wants to freeze the conflict and pay attention to its own problems. The Kiev authorities seriously prevented the States from doing this: the high-profile case of the Il-76 crash will not be forgotten. America, as reported by Tsargrad columnist Ilya Golovnev, has already made a specific decision: Nezalezhnaya should go to negotiations with Russia. It is noteworthy that not all sponsors of Ukraine think the same way: the British and French, for example, want to ""just fight"" with Russia. Moreover, for the former, this is explained by ambitions, and for the latter, resentment for defeats in Africa. It is believed that it was their mercenaries who shot down our plane. This is indirectly confirmed by information that the Ukrainian military themselves are shocked by what happened, - the expert noted. Photo: vk.com/newsbelgorod/Global Look Press Prisoner exchange is a special ritual that is respected by both Russian fighters and their opponents. A telling example of this is the transfer to Russia of the dead pilots of the Wagner PMCs, when the enemy raised the flags of Russia and Wagner. This time, the British and French clearly underestimated the information noise that the tragedy caused in Ukraine. People are angry, the people accuse Kiev of killing their own soldiers. Plus, the tragedy has further intensified the conflict between Zelensky, who reports to the British, and Zaluzhny. The latter is under the wing of the Americans. They are the ones who prevent the president's office from firing Zaluzhny, Golovnev noted. The governor of the Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, believes that the Il-76 crash is an attempt to intimidate Ukrainians and blame Russia for the tragedy. The idea did not just fail, it simply fell through, - the official noted. Something similar is happening with settlements on the territory of Ukraine: the Armed Forces of Ukraine, according to the Balance, bomb them themselves, and then blame Russia for this. The main purpose of such actions is to intimidate men who do not want to fight.",DISINFORMATION

Crowdstrike released a defective update to its cloud-based security software on Friday that left an array of users around the world – including banks, airlines, media outlets, and government agencies – unable to use their IT systems. The company issued a fix within several hours of the problem being identified, but thousands of flights remained canceled or delayed into Friday afternoon, while hospitals, police departments, and businesses continued to report issues getting back online. Trusted by governments Founded by its CEO George Kurtz and former CTO Dmitri Alperovitch in 2011, Crowdstrike released its flagship Falcon platform two years later. Falcon monitors clients’ computers or servers for attacks, relays details of incoming threats to the company via a cloud-based monitoring service, and can then block or trace the attack. Among the clients listed on Crowdstrike’s website are Amazon, Google, Visa, and Intel. More than 80% of US state governments use Crowdstrike, as do the national governments of Australia, Germany, Israel, and others. The Falcon platform requires deep access to a client’s devices, meaning that a faulty update can crash not just the software, but the device itself, as happened on a global scale on Friday. Working with spies Less than a year after Crowdstrike was founded, Kurtz and Alperovitch brought on board former FBI Executive Assistant Director Shawn Henry to head up its cybersecurity consultation wing. By 2014, Henry’s department was issuing a flurry of hacking and espionage accusations against China, Russia, and North Korea, with information provided by Crowdstrike helping the US Justice Department issue indictments that summer against five Chinese military officers who allegedly hacked US energy corporations. Russiagate Crowdstrike was hired by the US Democratic National Committee to investigate the theft of data from its servers in 2016. Published by WikiLeaks, the data revealed that the DNC had rigged the Democratic primary against Bernie Sanders, and that Hillary Clinton had effectively paid to control the committee. Crowdstrike concluded that Russia was behind the breach, with Henry testifying to Congress that the company “saw activity that we believed was consistent with activity we’d seen previously and had associated with the Russian government.” Henry’s assessment bolstered the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment, in which US spy agencies determined that Russia “exfiltrated large volumes of data from the DNC.” This document in turn was used to justify Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s two-year probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. However, the full transcript of Henry’s testimony was not declassified until 2020. In the complete transcript, Henry told lawmakers that his company had “no evidence that [any files] were actually exfiltrated” from the DNC’s servers, and that there was only “circumstantial evidence” and “indicators that that data was exfiltrated.” WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange suggested in 2016 that a DNC staffer named Seth Rich – who died in suspicious circumstances after the apparent breach – was the source of the leak. Former NSA official and whistleblower William Binney argued in 2017 that all available evidence pointed to the leak being the work of a disgruntled DNC insider.

The move comes after Kishida's sinking approval ratings which follow a corruption scandal surrounding the party, as well as rising living costs and a weakening yen, Sputnik reported.In November, Kishida had reportedly taken drastic action to replace top members of his cabinet following voter anger in response to a fundraising proceeds scandal. Lawmakers in Japan’s ruling party had been accused of underreporting funds with over 100 million yen ($680,000) of fundraising proceeds failing to be officially reported on.On Wednesday, peace activist, writer, and teacher, K.J. Noh joined Sputnik's The Critical Hour to explain how US interference has hampered Japan's economy and spurred China to continue its pacifist approach to foreign policy. In summarizing the economic history of Japan, Noh suggested that Japan became rich and modernized early on thanks to German imports which included ""German fascism"".Following its failure in World War II, Noh explained that Japan became a “tenant farmer” of the US and participated in war profiteering during the Vietnam War and quickly grew to become a wealthy country that was becoming “a little bit too big for its britches” and “got slapped down in the Plaza Accords” during which the US “essentially put it back into its box”.In Japan, it is common for lawmakers to hold fundraising events. The money that is fundraised typically comes from ticket sales and whatever leftover profits there are following the costs of the event goes to the organizers. These large-scale parties are a major source of revenue for factions. In 2022, the Kishida faction received ¥229.35 million in revenue with 80% coming from fundraising parties, according to a Japanese news source.“And, it also forced it to sanction both China and Russia. So, the key areas where Japan was competitive- that is, advanced chemicals, chip technology, electronics- all of that was banned. All that trade was banned or forced to be decoupled from China, and that has gutted Japan’s economy,” he added.“And then they will continue the escalation to war. And, simply, Japan is yet another sacrifice zone in the US global economic war against China. It's essentially a bumper, a crash test dummy,” the educator added.Washington, DC has grown angry in response to China’s growing power which is now keeping the US on its toes, a recent article published in the New Eastern Outlook writes. However, the US' constant attempts to provoke China to violence has had the opposite effect, with Beijing only reinforcing its pacifist approach to foreign diplomacy.“...the United States strives to portray East-West tensions as a conflict of hierarchy between two models of governance: liberal democracies, synonymous with the West, and autocracies, synonymous with emerging powers,” the article writes.“And so, what it is doing right now is continually putting pressure on China and it's trying to see if they can salami slice and continue to box China in.

Five LDP factions were accused of allegedly underreporting income in political funds reports. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has announced his plans to step down as leader of Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The move comes after Kishida's sinking approval ratings which follow a corruption scandal surrounding the party, as well as rising living costs and a weakening yen, Sputnik reported. In November, Kishida had reportedly taken drastic action to replace top members of his cabinet following voter anger in response to a fundraising proceeds scandal. Lawmakers in Japan’s ruling party had been accused of underreporting funds with over 100 million yen ($680,000) of fundraising proceeds failing to be officially reported on. On Wednesday, peace activist, writer, and teacher, K.J. Noh joined Sputnik's The Critical Hour to explain how US interference has hampered Japan's economy and spurred China to continue its pacifist approach to foreign policy. “...certainly the LDP is corrupt from beginning to end, and it's essentially a party that is run and built from slush funds. It was built by the CIA. The CIA created this slush fund, and then it put them into power along with the backing of the gangster class. It put the unrepentant militarists back into power in 1955, and they've been essentially a one-party state,” Noh explained. “Japan has been a one-party state since that period. And so, to casually dismiss that is nonsense. But, what it does show is that they do need a scapegoat. Japan's economy is crashing. It's going the way of Germany or the UK. And so, they need a scapegoat,” the analyst added. In summarizing the economic history of Japan, Noh suggested that Japan became rich and modernized early on thanks to German imports which included ""German fascism"". Following its failure in World War II, Noh explained that Japan became a “tenant farmer” of the US and participated in war profiteering during the Vietnam War and quickly grew to become a wealthy country that was becoming “a little bit too big for its britches” and “got slapped down in the Plaza Accords” during which the US “essentially put it back into its box”. “They put Kishida in after Abe was shot and he was shot, essentially, because of Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) slush funds with the Moonies. So let's banish any notion that the LDP is clean and sober. But since the US has pushed Japan into its junior partner in its escalation to war against China, it has forced it to increase its military spending, by multiples, so that Japan will have very shortly the third-largest military budget on the planet,” Noh explained. In Japan, it is common for lawmakers to hold fundraising events. The money that is fundraised typically comes from ticket sales and whatever leftover profits there are following the costs of the event goes to the organizers. These large-scale parties are a major source of revenue for factions. In 2022, the Kishida faction received ¥229.35 million in revenue with 80% coming from fundraising parties, according to a Japanese news source. “And, it also forced it to sanction both China and Russia. So, the key areas where Japan was competitive- that is, advanced chemicals, chip technology, electronics- all of that was banned. All that trade was banned or forced to be decoupled from China, and that has gutted Japan’s economy,” he added. “And then on top of that, when the US forced Japan, as a member of the G7, to stop importing oil and natural gas from Russia, that put an even greater impact on an already ailing economy. And so, they need a scapegoat for this economic collapse. And so, Kishida is on his way out,” Noh continued. “He's going to fall on his sword and they're going to put in somebody who's essentially a clone.” “And then they will continue the escalation to war. And, simply, Japan is yet another sacrifice zone in the US global economic war against China. It's essentially a bumper, a crash test dummy,” the educator added. “It's like a calf being fattened for slaughter. And Japan and Korea were getting big for their britches. And then essentially they were taken down, dismantled. And now they get to reconstitute themselves a little bit as long as they stay in their place,” he added. Washington, DC has grown angry in response to China’s growing power which is now keeping the US on its toes, a recent article published in the New Eastern Outlook writes. However, the US' constant attempts to provoke China to violence has had the opposite effect, with Beijing only reinforcing its pacifist approach to foreign diplomacy. “...the United States strives to portray East-West tensions as a conflict of hierarchy between two models of governance: liberal democracies, synonymous with the West, and autocracies, synonymous with emerging powers,” the article writes. “The US wants to see if it can either continually infringe on China and do what it did to Japan and Korea, which is not likely to happen, but essentially put it back into its spot. How dare China challenge US hegemony, US supremacy? How dare it not follow the rules-based international order, i.e. US arbitrary dictates,” Noh explained from the viewpoint of US powers. “And so, what it is doing right now is continually putting pressure on China and it's trying to see if they can salami slice and continue to box China in. They're just coming closer and closer, boxing it in, closer and closer,"" he said. ""...if China reacts and it reacts violently, tries to push its way out, then the US will have a pretext for war. And then when it starts to have that war, that will divert China from its key goal in development, which is economic development, peaceful development. And, therefore, there will be a kinetic war that will also derail China.” “Either way, the US is seeking to undercut and derail and undermine China, put it back into its box like Korea and Japan,” Noh explained. “What China is doing is it's going to use a peaceful method to overcome war. And it does that by building up good relations with all the countries of the Global South without forcing them to choose.” 11 December 2023, 02:33 GMT",DISINFORMATION

They stopped Russian President Vladimir Putin from being elected to Brussels. And now they’re telling us all about how they did it, before Marvel Studios’ costume department comes knocking on the door of the EU clown tent to ask for their capes back. The Russians and their “disinformation” didn’t have any impact on the European Elections earlier this year. That’s now the official word from the EU itself. Vera Jourova, the Vice President of the European Commission for Values and Transparency, has emerged from an Orwellian novel to announce that “based on currently available information, no major information interference operation capable of disrupting the elections was recorded.” So much for the public freak out that European parliamentarians were having back in April 2024, demanding even more censorship of “Kremlin-backed media outlets” and “disinformation campaigns” in what they qualified as “Kremlin-backed attempts to interfere with and undermine European democratic processes.” We’re supposed to believe that it’s all because Jourova had embarked on a crackdown, er, “Democracy Tour” to commiserate not just with election officials and authorities, but also with “civil society” NGOs, industry, and media. Surely it has nothing to do with the fact that there wasn’t really much disinformation to begin with and that they’ve been blowing the issue way out of proportion. Jourova herself acknowledged that even the EU’s Digital Media Observatory was only able to find between 4% to 8% of what they qualify as “disinformation” among all articles analyzed between May 2023 and March 2024, and that the figure climbed to just 15% in May 2024, right before the EU’s June election. This means that around EU election time, a whopping 85% of information and analysis floating around in the public domain was EU-approved. Jourova said that “disinformation narratives followed the topics we expected: there were allegations that the elections are rigged, but mostly topics that trigger a strong emotional impact – the war on Ukraine, the Middle East, false narratives on climate change, and migrants.” We used to call those things topics of debate. But that was before they decided that the agendas Brussels was trying to ram down everyone’s throats across the entire bloc wouldn’t be served by messy democratic dissent. Best to just dismiss, marginalize, or censor opposing information and narratives and be forced to deal with being violently mugged by reality later on issues like Ukraine’s not actually “winning,” regardless of how expensive life has become for EU citizens as a result of the bloc’s suicidal pro-Ukraine policies, and migration being an actual five-alarm problem for the EU as it faces the palpable rise of populism backlash for not doing enough earlier. And the EU elections are certainly not rigged! The people elect representatives to EU parliament, then a ‘president’ is handpicked behind closed doors and plopped in front of them for a simple yes/no confirmation vote. That person, currently ‘Queen’ Ursula von der Leyen, who has never actually been elected to the EU parliament, then runs a ‘royal’ European Commission of bureaucratic desk jockeys that crafts and dictates policy for the entire bloc. Anyone calling this anything other than a model democratic institution must be a Russian agent. A quick trip to the European Digital Media Observatory’s website, and a random click on an article, finds that it qualifies Ukrainian fake news, like the nonsense story about the ‘Ghost of Kyiv’ fighter pilot who was downing Russian jets left and right at the outset of the conflict, as “soft propaganda” necessary to rally Ukrainian troops and allies – unlike Russia’s “hard propaganda.” And what might that be, exactly? The same analysis includes an obviously satirical cartoon caricature of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky and points out that, no, Zelensky did not actually emerge as a cartoon from a hole in the streets of Paris with paper money and gold bars flying into his mouth. They even included a photo of the actual “real” Parisian street, before someone photoshopped in the cartoon Zelensky, to prove that Russia was spreading lies. “Sometimes, it requires thinking outside of the box, using geolocation methods or contacting fact-checkers or sources on the field, such as Myth Detector in Georgia, to debunk a fabricated caricature of president Zelensky in Paris,” the intrepid EU fact-checkers say of their work in protecting Europeans from laughing their posterior off, at least until they visit the observatory’s website. Jourova credited the Democracy Action Plan of 2020, meant to bolster by both “strengthening media freedom” and “countering disinformation.” Nothing says freedom and democracy like institutional powers deciding what information should be free and what should be censored into oblivion. The EU is starting to resemble a casino in Las Vegas: the house always wins, regardless of who voters actually send there. And the current establishment status quo is doing everything to ensure the perpetuation of the same system, including defining censorship as necessary to save democracy and freedom as adherence to their agenda. Maybe if they chilled out a bit more and loosened their iron grip, then not only would dissent perhaps enable better decisions that would win voter support, but it would also take the wind out of the sails of populist parties who are surging in EU and national elections largely because voters are looking to elect people who are about as far away as possible from the establishment’s current blast radius. A lot of good all this EU censorship and information meddling did for the establishment’s cause in actual EU voting, though, with anti-establishment parties continuing to make gains. Not quite enough to book the result entirely on Russia quite yet, as the US establishment tried to do when Donald Trump won in 2016. But watch out for what happens in future Western elections, particularly this November in the US. If establishment darling Kamala Harris wins, it’ll be yet another victory for election security. If populist favorite Trump wins, get ready for it to be Russia’s fault. Because they’re looking everywhere for meddling except in the mirror.

https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/us-foreign-policy-wont-change-with-trump-as-the-deep-state-is-in-charge/,https://app.cappture.cc/snapshots/1efa64e9-4433-66a2-83a2-06a13b0e4978,2024-11-19,"Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election has raised concern among supporters of the country’s current foreign policy direction under the Biden administration, and brought hope to those interested in its transformation. The pressing question, resonating not only within American political circles, but also among Washington’s allies and adversaries worldwide, is how much change in US foreign policy can be expected from a new Republican administration. Many experts, drawing on Trump’s and his campaign team’s bold statements, suggest that his return to the presidency will bring significant policy shifts. However, even with a Republican majority in both chambers of Congress (especially the Senate, which holds considerable influence over foreign policy), it is unlikely that Trump will be able to fully deliver on his promises in this area. In theory, Trump’s return to the presidency will occur under the most favorable conditions for implementing his foreign policy agenda. Republicans not only have a strengthened majority in the House of Representatives but have also regained control of the Senate, which significantly influences foreign policy by confirming key appointments and ratifying international treaties. Current concerns over substantial foreign policy changes echo Trump’s first term, when his strong statements were often perceived as policy shifts, but ultimately were not. Once back in the White House, Trump is expected to reintroduce the “America First” principle in foreign policy, which implies a more pragmatic approach to international issues but does not necessarily entail a wholesale change in foreign policy goals and priorities. The expectations of inevitable radical shifts in the US foreign policy following Trump’s 2016 victory proved false. For example, the Republican promised to dismantle NATO, build closer ties with Russia, and take a tougher stance on China. Trump criticized European countries for insufficient defense spending and repeatedly threatened to reduce the US role in NATO. He may again insist that NATO countries increase their defense spending, emphasizing that the US should not bear the main burden. This approach created tensions within the alliance and led to a redistribution of responsibilities, ultimately strengthening NATO by encouraging greater European involvement in their own security. Trump also expressed a desire to establish closer ties with Moscow, speaking positively about Putin and pursuing a new nuclear arms control treaty that would include China. However, these ambitions led to additional sanctions against Russia and increased aid to Ukraine, precluding any real improvement in US-Russia relations. Under Trump, the US began an active trade war with China, restricted cooperation in high-tech sectors, and implemented measures to counter Chinese influence in Asia and other regions. However, these confrontational steps were a logical continuation of containment and the “pivot to Asia” strategy initiated by the Obama administration, thus does not fall under the definition of a major policy shift. One of the key foreign policy priorities of Trump’s second term will be the conflict in Ukraine. During his campaign, Trump claimed that, as president, he could quickly bring an end to the country’s war against Russia. However, he also said he would not commit to increasing aid to Ukraine, insisting that European countries should take on more responsibility for its support. Trump’s relationship with Russia has been marked by contradictions. On the one hand, he has sought warmer relations with Putin, repeatedly speaking of him in positive terms, calling him “brilliant” and “smart.” Meanwhile, he condemned Russia’s operation in Ukraine, calling it a “huge mistake” on Putin’s part. This inconsistency, coupled with anti-Ukraine statements from members of Trump’s inner circle, has created uncertainty around the stance Washington would take under a new Republican administration. Trump is expected to pursue a peaceful resolution to the Ukraine conflict, likely leveraging Kiev’s dependence on the US military and economic assistance, as well as the potential cessation of this support, as an argument for peace. A peace agreement would likely come on terms less favorable to Ukraine than it would have a year ago. With the situation on the ground shifting in Russia’s favor, Ukraine’s territorial losses suggest that the conditions of any future peace could be more challenging for Kiev than if negotiations had taken place earlier. Should this scenario materialize, like other key areas, it would not signify a major shift in US foreign policy. The current Biden administration has already shown signs of “Ukraine fatigue” – weariness with the costly support for Kiev. Public sentiment in the US also reflects a steady decline in support for maintaining current aid levels to Ukraine. Even if there had been a Democratic victory in the presidential election, with Kamala Harris winning the White House and Democrats retaining control of Congress, support for Ukraine would likely continue its gradual decline. The Trump administration may adopt a strategy focused on a more pragmatic resolution of the Ukraine conflict. This approach would likely combine a reduction in military aid with active diplomatic mediation, which, if successful, would allow Trump to showcase an “effective resolution” of the conflict. However, for Ukraine and its allies, this strategy would mean increased pressure on Kiev to compromise, potentially weakening its position in negotiations and shifting the balance of power in the region. The reason radical changes in US foreign policy are unlikely lies in the institutional inertia of the decision-making system. The country’s foreign policy is heavily bureaucratized and cannot operate independently of the balance of interests among various influence groups. The president wields substantial power but must consider Congress for important foreign policy decisions. As in other areas of decision-making, the influence of the deep state on foreign policy remains significant. In Congress, a bipartisan consensus exists on key areas of American foreign policy: containment of Russia and China, maintaining NATO, and supporting Israel. This consensus allows for only tactical adjustments while preserving the overarching strategy. Thus, a second Trump term will likely lead to a more pragmatic foreign policy. His administration would likely focus on a tougher stance toward China, reduced support for Ukraine, redistribution of responsibilities within NATO, and decreased US involvement in global alliances and agreements. While these changes may appear significant, they will not constitute a complete overhaul of Washington’s long-term foreign policy direction.",DISINFORMATION

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the move on Thursday morning following a meeting with Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides in Lebanon’s capital, Beirut. The financial envelope, made up entirely of grants and to be dispersed by 2027, will help Lebanon strengthen basic services such as education, social protection and health, and spur economic reforms in the crisis-stricken country, von der Leyen said. But some three quarters of the cash - a total of €736 million - will be specifically dedicated to helping Lebanon grapple with the challenges it faces in welcoming Syrian refugees. ""We understand the challenges that Lebanon faces with hosting Syrian refugees and other displaced persons. It is vital to ensure the well-being of host communities and Syrian refugees,"" von der Leyen said. The Commission chief also vowed to ""look at how to make the EU's assistance more effective,"" including facilitating a ""more structured approach to voluntary returns"" of displaced Syrians in cooperation with the UN refugee agency (UNHCR). It comes after EU leaders backed deeper engagement with Beirut last month to help safeguard it from the repercussions of the conflict in the Middle East, and after Cyprus raised the alarm over a sharp peak in the number of Syrian refugees arriving from Lebanon. It also follows a string of agreements signed over the last year between Brussels and African countries in a bid to stem migration into Europe. A deepening economic crisis and fragile government make Lebanon particularly vulnerable to the instability gripping the region in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war. The country is home to some 210,000 Palestinian and 1.5 million Syrian refugees, prompting fears regional instability could unleash a wave of migrants towards Europe via the island of Cyprus. Cash to stem refugee flows In early April, Cyprus announced it would temporarily halt the processing of asylum applications due to a surge in arrivals of Syrian refugees transiting through Lebanon and attempting to reach the island, which lies just 260 km off the Lebanese coast in the Mediterranean Sea. Over 1,000 people arrived in Cyprus by boats from Lebanon during the first two weeks of April, leaving refugee and reception centres on the island overloaded. ""The problems seen on the Cypriot border is only one example of what could happen if this problem is not addressed,"" Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati acknowledged on Thursday, thanking Cyprus' President Christodoulides for brokering the agreement. Hailing the announcement as ""historic"", Christodoulides said that the financial envelope would address a situation that is ""not sustainable"" for either Lebanon, Cyprus or the European Union. ""While we commend the Lebanese government for hosting a large number of Syrian refugees for more than 12 years, we are also fully cognisant of the enormous pressure that this creates to your economy and to your society,"" Christodoulides said. He backed von der Leyen's proposal of intensifying work with partners such as UNHCR on voluntary returns, where refugees who want to return to their home countries - even if the UN agency considers it unsafe for them - are supported to do so. Christodoulides also went further by calling for the status of some regions of Syria to be ""re-examined"" as safe areas to facilitate the return of migrants and refugees, a proposal he tabled at last month's summit meeting of EU leaders. Syria, which has been under the authoritarian regime of Bashar al-Assad for more than two decades, has been designated an unsafe country since the civil war erupted in 2011. But refugee host countries such as Turkey and Lebanon have been pushing for the mass return of Syrian refugees to the country. A European Commission spokesperson confirmed that the EU has followed the lead of the UNHCR in their approach to safe zones in Syria, and that Brussels is ""embarking now on discussions to see how to approach this issue in the upcoming period."" Von der Leyen also floated a working arrangement between Lebanon and the EU's border agency, Frontex, ""particularly on information exchange and situational awareness."" The agency currently has such arrangements in place with 19 partner countries. Security of Lebanon 'at stake' Both Christodoulides and von der Leyen also acknowledged the threat posed by the war between Israel and Hamas to Lebanon's security. The Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah is present in the country and has continuously exchanged fire across Lebanon's southern border with Israel since the outbreak of the war last October. Hezbollah also took part in Tehran’s unprecedented aerial attack on Israel last month. ""We are deeply concerned about the volatile situation in South Lebanon. What is at stake is the security of both Lebanon and Israel. The two cannot be disassociated,"" von der Leyen said. Von der Leyen asked for a UN resolution calling on Israel to withdraw its troops from the Blue Line, the border demarcation between Lebanon and Israel, to be respected.",CREDIBLE

It was the result of the German defeat in World War I, Polish nationalism sparked by the re-creation of an independent Polish state, and the Bolsheviks’ determination to carry the gains they had achieved during the Russian Civil War to central Europe. The decisive Polish victory resulted in the establishment of the Russo-Polish border that existed until 1939. The end of World War I and the Polish advance On the day of Germany’s surrender (November 11, 1918), Poland’s independence was proclaimed in Warsaw, but huge German armies still occupied the western part of the former Russian Empire. Józef Piłsudski, provisional head of the Polish state and commander in chief of the nascent Polish army, decided not to interfere with the retreat of the German forces from Russia, provided that they went through East Prussia. A temporary demarcation line between Polish and German forces was established to the west of the Kovel-Brest-Białystok-Grajewo railway. Evacuation of the former Russian lands by German forces had to be completed by the beginning of February 1919. Because of German-Soviet collusion, every strip of land evacuated by the Germans was immediately occupied by the Red Army. German generals were hoping to bring Soviet Russia and Poland into a war which would destroy the latter and enable Germany to appear as the sole defender of Europe against the revolutionary flood of Marxism. On the Soviet side, Vladimir Lenin’s strategy was the converse: the mission of the Red Army was “to destroy the wall separating Soviet Russia from revolutionary Germany.” Thus, as the February 1919 deadline approached, the Red Army was closing in on the Hrodna-Brest-Kovel line. Piłsudski decided that it was vital “to reject…the forces aiming at imposing a foreign form of government on Poland.” The Polish offensive began on February 9, 1919. At the end of the year, the Polish forces stood on the middle Dvina and along the Berezina, Ptich, Ubort, and upper Sluch rivers to a point east of Kam’yanets-Podilskyy (now in Ukraine) near the Romanian frontier. The Polish advance had of course been helped by the fact that the Red Army was also engaged against White armies in the Russian Civil War. Piłsudski expected a powerful Soviet offensive in the spring of 1920, but on January 28, 1920, the Soviet government offered an armistice based on the existing front line and proposed a peace conference. Piłsudski, however, knew that the Soviets were conducting a massive buildup in the area; Red Army strength on the Polish front increased from 7 divisions in January to 20 in March. Moreover, Piłsudski was convinced that the moment was favourable for reviving the historic idea of a Polish-Lithuanian-Ukrainian federation. On April 21 he and the Ukrainian leader Symon Petlyura signed a treaty of alliance. Three days later an army group of ten infantry divisions (including two Ukrainian) and four cavalry brigades was launched against two weak Soviet armies south of the Pripet River. On May 7 Kyiv was occupied by a Polish army under Gen. Edward Śmigły-Rydz, while between the Dnieper and Dniester rivers Polish-Ukrainian forces held a line that stretched through central Ukraine, from Bila Tserkva in the north to Yampil’ in the south. The Russian counterattack and Allied intervention Further advance southward was halted when Piłsudski learned that, on May 15, 1920, Gen. Mikhayl Tukhachevsky, commander of the Soviet Western Army Group, had attacked across the Dvina. Tukhachevsky reached Narach Lake, but by June 7 he was driven back on the Berezina. In the meantime, however, the Soviet supreme commander, Sergei S. Kamenev, had ordered Semyon Budenny to march northward with four cavalry divisions. By June 7 Budenny had occupied Zhytomyr and Berdychiv in Śmigły-Rydz’s rear; Śmigły-Rydz was therefore ordered to evacuate Kyiv (June 12) and to retreat westward. He succeeded in doing so, but on July 5 Budenny entered Rovno (now Rivne, Ukraine). The decisive battles started north of the Pripet Marshes. On July 2, 1920, Tukhachevsky issued an order of the day proclaiming to his armies that “the fate of the general revolution will be decided in the west” and that “the road to world conflagration leads over Poland’s corpse.” Two days later, on a front stretching about 300 miles (roughly 500 km), he attacked with 21 infantry divisions and with Gai Khan’s cavalry corps on his right flank (about 220,000 combatants). The Polish army group under the elderly Stanisław Szeptycki, comprising 12 infantry divisions and one cavalry brigade (about 120,000 combatants), started a general retreat. Minsk (now in Belarus) fell to the Russians on July 11, Wilno (now Vilnius, Lithuania) on July 14, and Grodno (now Hrodna, Belarus) on July 19. In less than a month, the Poles had lost virtually all of the gains they had made in the previous year. The Russians now found themselves in a position to invade Poland. Russian war commissar Leon Trotsky was against pushing on, but Lenin allowed political considerations to outweigh the opinions of the military experts. His view, which was strongly supported by many Polish communists who were on the Russian side, was that the Russians would be greeted as revolutionary liberators. The Battle of Warsaw and “the Miracle on the Vistula” Although the tide of war had seemingly turned against him, Piłsudski never lost his nerve. Needing arms and ammunition, he sent his prime minister, Władysław Grabski, and his chief of general staff, Tadeusz Rozwadowski, on a mission to the Supreme Allied Council, which was then in session in Belgium. The Western Allies promised help which either did not materialize (as from the United Kingdom) or arrived too late (as from France). However, a Franco-British diplomatic and military mission, led by Gen. Maxime Weygand, was sent to Warsaw. Piłsudski offered Weygand the post of chief of Polish general staff, but Weygand sensibly declined and became, instead, an adviser to Rozwadowski. At this point, Tukhachevsky was still advancing westward, with the bold plan of crossing the Vistula at Płock so as to be able to attack Warsaw’s defenders from the rear. Piłsudski divined this intention and, after discussions with Rozwadowski and Weygand, wrote on the night of August 5–6, 1920, his historic order of the day prescribing (1) that in the south the enemy should be stopped east of Lviv (now in Ukraine); (2) that in the north the left flank of the Polish forces should be covered and the right bank of the Vistula should be held for the defense of Warsaw; and (3) that in the centre an army of five divisions should be concentrated on the Wieprz River for a strategic maneuver designed to disrupt the rear of the Soviet armies as they approached Warsaw. Polish morale was high, and the Weygand mission had helped restore service of supplies to the front lines. New bodies of reinforcements were moved forward from depots in western Poland, and depleted units received fresh stores of vital matériel. The Russian forces in the south made no concerted move and appeared to have no inkling of the attack to come. Gen.Władysław Sikorski’s Fifth Army in the north was the first to advance. A Soviet movement around his left flank had assumed alarming proportions and had to be stopped. On August 14 he pressed forward from his defensive position at Modlin Fortress, north of Warsaw, and at once encountered the Soviet Fifteenth Army. Sikorski persisted in his attacks all through August 15–16, his men fighting with determination. Not even the appearance of elements of the Soviet Fourth Army in his left rear deterred him. After dispatching covering detachments to guard his rear, Sikorski attacked again on August 17. His determination reaped its reward, and the Russians gave way in front of him. Their retreat rapidly devolved into a rout. Piłsudski himself took command of the Wieprz operation, and on August 16 he started advancing with his shock divisions. The blow against the left flank of the Soviet Sixteenth Army came as a complete surprise, and they offered little resistance. Over the next two days, the Poles covered more than 50 miles (80 km). By August 18 the Soviet Third Army, which lay between the Fifteenth (destroyed by Sikorski) and the Sixteenth (broken by Piłsudski), had fallen back in hopeless confusion. On the extreme Soviet right, their Fourth Army, which contained some of the most experienced Red Army regiments as well as the cavalry corps, had reached the Vistula between Toruń and Płock as part of a great turning movement. The Fourth Army was preparing to fall upon the Polish left flank when Sikorski suddenly advanced. Had the Soviets continued to aggressively press their attack even then, they might have succeeded, but they hesitated and were lost. Their half-hearted efforts against Sikorski’s left had little effect, and it was not until August 20 that Tukhachevsky’s order for a general retreat reached them. On August 22 at Mława (now in Poland), and August 28 at Chorzele (now in Poland), they were successful in cutting themselves a passage through the Polish lines, but on August 24 at Kovno they ran up against Pilsudski’s Fourth Army. Almost without making an effort to attack, they passed ignominiously over the East Prussian border to internment. The pace of the Polish pursuit was remarkable. From August 16–25, the lead units of the Polish Second Army had covered some 200 miles (320 km). The Polish Fourth Army averaged 25 miles (40 km) a day in their advance. Polish supply lines were left far behind, and the troops existed as they could upon the exhausted countryside. By this point Soviet resistance was so completely broken that there was little fear of counterattack and the Polish units had ample time in which to reorganize. Tukhachevsky’s attempt to make a stand along the Sejny-Grodno-Volkovysk line ended in another defeat (September 20–28). By the beginning of October, Polish forces had reconquered the major part of the territory occupied during 1919. Casualties and significance An armistice was signed at Riga on October 12, 1920, and military operations ceased six days later. The Treaty of Riga, concluded on March 18, 1921, provided for the bulk of Ukraine to remain a Soviet republic, although substantial portions of Belorussia (Belarus) and Ukraine were ceded to Poland. Vilnius, which had changed hands several times since the end of World War I, remained a point of contention. The League of Nations arranged a partial armistice that put Vilnius under Lithuanian control and called for negotiations to settle all open border disputes. Just days after that agreement was signed, however, a Polish army drove the Lithuanian troops out of the area, proclaimed the independence of a new central Lithuanian state, and established its government at Vilnius. Poland formally annexed Vilnius and the surrounding area in 1922, a claim that was never recognized by Lithuania. Poland and Lithuania would remain in a state of frozen conflict until 1938. The war was a disaster for the nascent Soviet Union. In the Battle of Warsaw alone, the Poles captured 66,000 prisoners of war, along with 231 artillery pieces and 1,023 machine guns. During the Soviet collapse, tens of thousands of Red Army soldiers fled into captivity in East Prussia and Lithuania. Lenin had seen the war against Poland as a necessary response to the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. “By attacking Poland,” he said in a secret party congress, “we are attacking also the Allies. By destroying the Polish army we are destroying the Versailles settlement.” In the end a Soviet-sponsored government for “liberated” Poland, headed by Julian Marchlewski, Feliks Dzerzhinsky, and Feliks Kon, which had already established itself at Białystok, had to flee back to Moscow. Even after the signing of the armistice in October 1920, the Soviets delayed for over six months in the hopes of gaining more advantageous terms. Only the outbreak of the Kronshtadt Rebellion in March 1921 and the threat of a wider uprising against the Bolsheviks would force the Soviets to conclude a final peace agreement.",CREDIBLE

Russia’s unjustified and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and the weaponisation of energy have made diversification of energy supplies a necessity for EU countries. Diversification is a lengthy and costly process, requiring investment in infrastructure, for example building new pipelines and liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals. However, the EU and its countries are acting fast. Reducing dependence on Russian fossil fuels is a tangible reality. Imports of pipeline gas coming from Russia have drastically diminished, while volumes of LNG imports from reliable partners like the United States and Norway are on the increase. Moving away from Russian gas The share of Russia’s pipeline gas in EU imports dropped from over 40% in 2021 to about 8% in 2023. For pipeline gas and LNG combined, Russia accounted for less than 15% of total EU gas imports. The drop was possible mainly thanks to a sharp increase in LNG import and an overall reduction of gas consumption in the EU. Top gas suppliers in 2023 Norway and the United States were the top suppliers of gas in 2023. Norway provided almost 30% of all gas imports. Additional suppliers include North African countries, the UK and Qatar. Growing LNG imports In 2023, the EU imported over 120 billion cubic meters (bcm) of LNG. In 2023, the United States was the largest LNG supplier to the EU, representing almost 50% of total LNG imports. In 2023, comparing to 2021, imports from the US almost tripled. The largest LNG importers in the EU are: - France - Spain - Netherlands - Belgium - Italy Why is gas so important for the EU and for Europeans? In 2022, the 27 countries of the European Union consumed over 350 (billion cubic meters) of gas – 13% less than in 2021. Gas is mainly used for power generation, household heating and industrial processes. Over 30% of households in the EU are heated using gas.

Sanctions have been imposed also in relation to human rights violations and hybrid threats. Human rights violations in Russia Why sanctions? The European Union is deeply concerned about the continuing deterioration of the human rights situation in Russia, especially in the context of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. The EU strongly condemns the very significant expansion of restrictive legislation, the systematic and intensifying repression against civil society and human rights defenders, as well as the unabated crackdown on independent media, individual journalists and media workers, political opposition members and other critical voices active throughout the Russian Federation and outside the country. On 19 February 2024, the High Representative Josep Borrell expressed, on behalf of the EU, outrage on the death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and stated that the ultimate responsibility for this death lies with President Putin and the Russian authorities. At the European Council of 21-22 March 2024, EU leaders called for the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners in Russia and an end to the persecution of the country’s political opposition. They also called for an independent and transparent international investigation into the death of Alexei Navalny, stating that ultimate responsibility for his death lies with the Russian authorities. What are the sanctions? The EU has imposed sanctions in response to human rights violations and abuses in Russia under two sanctions regimes: - global human rights - a country-specific regime, adopted on 27 May 2024 The restrictive measures target those responsible for serious human rights violations or abuses, for repression of civil society and democratic opposition, and for undermining democracy and the rule of law in Russia. They consist of travel bans for individuals, an asset freeze for individuals and entities, and a prohibition on making funds or economic resources available to those listed. The individuals and entities sanctioned include: - the penal colonies where Navalny was held from June 2022 until his death - the Federal Penitentiary Service of the Russian Federation - judges, prosecutors and members of the judiciary involved in the death of Navalny and in the cases of Vladimir Kara-Murza, Oleg Orlov and Alexandra Skochilenko - high-level officials in the penitentiary system and in the Ministry of Justice - the Russian para-governmental Safe Internet League The country-specific regime adopted on May 2024 also allows the EU to target those who provide financial, technical, or material support for, or are otherwise involved in or associated with people and entities committing human rights violations in Russia. Furthermore, this regime introduces trade restrictions on exporting equipment which might be used for internal repression, as well as on equipment, technology or software intended primarily for use in information security and the monitoring or interception of telecommunication. - Regulation concerning restrictive measures against serious human rights violations and abuses (EU official journal) - Decision concerning restrictive measures against serious human rights violations and abuses (EU official journal) - Regulation concerning restrictive measures in view of the situation in Russia (EU official journal) - Decision concerning restrictive measures in view of the situation in Russia (EU official journal) Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine Why sanctions? Since March 2014, the EU has progressively imposed restrictive measures on Russia in response to: - the illegal annexation of Crimea (2014) - the full-scale invasion of Ukraine (2022) - the illegal annexation of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions of Ukraine (2022) So far, 15 packages of sanctions have been adopted. The measures are designed to weaken Russia's economic base, depriving it of critical technologies and markets and significantly curtail its ability to wage war. The EU has also adopted sanctions against Belarus, Iran and North Korea in response to their support for Russia in the military aggression against Ukraine. Sanctions against individuals and entities EU restrictive measures in respect of actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine apply to a total of almost 2 400 individuals and entities. Individuals sanctioned include: The list also includes individuals responsible for or involved in the: - so-called 'referenda' in 2022 and 'elections' in 2023 in Ukraine's territories - atrocities committed in Bucha and Mariupol - missile strikes against civilians and critical infrastructure - deportations and forced adoptions of Ukrainian children - military re-education of Ukrainian children - recruitment of Syrian mercenaries to fight in Ukraine - manufacture and supply of drones - circumvention of sanctions Individuals from Iran, Belarus and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are also included in the list. Sanctioned entities include: - political parties - armed forces and paramilitary groups, including the Wagner group - banks and financial institutions - media organisations responsible for propaganda and disinformation - companies in the military and defence sectors - companies in the energy sector - companies in the aviation, shipbuilding and machine building sectors - companies in the IT, telecoms and insurance sectors - companies involved in the circumvention of sanctions - PJSC Alrosa, the largest diamond-mining company in the world - the 'All-Russia People’s Front' movement - organisations responsible for re-educational programmes for and deportation of Ukrainian children The measures were first introduced in March 2014 and were most recently extended until 15 March 2025. - Regulation concerning restrictive measures in respect of actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine (EU official journal) - Decision concerning restrictive measures in respect of actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine (EU official journal) The restrictive measures include: Travel ban Targeted persons cannot enter or transit through EU territories. Asset freeze All the assets of sanctioned individuals and entities in the EU are frozen. Unavailability of funds EU persons and entities cannot make any funds available to those sanctioned. Use of profits from frozen assets to help Ukraine In May 2024, the Council greenlighted the use of unexpected and extraordinary revenues resulting from the implementation of EU sanctions against Russia to help Ukraine. In July 2024, the EU made available the first payment of €1.5 billion generated from immobilised Russian assets. The windfall net profits generated by immobilised Russian assets are being used to support Ukraine's armed forces, defence industry and reconstruction. The funds are being channelled through the European Peace Facility and other EU programmes. - Extraordinary revenues generated by immobilised Russian assets: Council greenlights the use of windfall net profits to support Ukraine’s self-defence and reconstruction (press release, 21 May 2024) - First transfer of €1.5 billion of proceeds from immobilised Russian assets (European Commission) Misappropriation of Ukrainian state funds In March 2014 the Council decided to freeze the assets of individuals responsible for the misappropriation of Ukrainian state funds.

In March 2015 EU leaders decided to align the existing sanctions regime with the full implementation of the Minsk agreements, which was scheduled to take place at the end of December 2015. Since this did not happen, the Council extended the economic sanctions until 31 July 2016. Since July 2016, the economic sanctions have been extended successively for six months at a time. They are currently extended until 31 July 2025. Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the EU has intensified the measures under this sanctions regime. Economic sanctions target Russia’s financial, trade, energy, transport, technology and defence sectors, as well as services provided to Russia or to Russian nationals. They also target Belarus, due to its complicity with Russia, and Iran, in response to the manufacturing and provision of drones. Finance Defence and technology Energy Trade Transport Services Here is an overview of the economic sanctions against Russia. Finance Sanctions in the finance sector include a SWIFT ban on 10 Russian banks, restrictions on Russia’s access to the EU’s capital and financial markets and bans on: - transactions with the Russian Central Bank and the Russian Regional Development Bank - large deposits by Russian nationals in EU banks - investment in projects co-financed by the Russian Direct Investment Fund - the supply of euro-denominated banknotes to Russia - the provision of crypto assets and of advice on trusts to Russian nationals - the use of the 'System for Transfer of Financial Messages' (SPFS) Energy Sanctions in the energy sector include a price cap relating to the maritime transport of Russian oil and petroleum products, and bans on: - imports from Russia of crude oil, petroleum products and coal - imports from Russia of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) - re-exports of Russian liquified natural gas (LNG) in EU facilities - exports to Russia of goods and technologies for the energy industry - the provision of gas storage capacity for Russian nationals - new investments in Russian's energy and mining sectors - new investments in Russia's LNG projects Transport Sanctions in the transport sector include the closure of EU airspace to all Russian-owned aircraft and of EU ports to Russian vessels and bans on: - exports to Russia of goods and technology in the aviation, maritime and space sectors - exports to Russia of all aircraft, including aircraft parts and jet fuel - Russian road transport operators transporting goods into the EU - trailers and semi-trailers registered in Russia transporting goods into the EU - transactions with the Russian maritime shipping register - the provision of all related repair, maintenance and financial services Defence and technology Sanctions in the defence and technology sectors include a ban on exports to Russia of: - dual-use goods and technology for military use - drone engines and components for the production of drones - arms and civilian firearms and the components thereof - ammunition, military vehicles and paramilitary equipment - IT, electronic and optical components - chemicals, navigational instruments, generators and thermostats - cameras, lenses, toy drones, laptops and hard drives - other goods and technology which could enhance Russia’s defence and security sectors Trade in raw materials and other goods Sanctions in the trade sector include a ban on exports to Russia of luxury goods, quotas for imports of potassium chloride and a ban on imports from Russia of: - steel, iron and pig iron - cement, bitumen and asphalt - copper and aluminium wires, tubes and pipes - wood, paper, synthetic rubber and plastics - helium - seafood, spirits, cigarettes and cosmetics - diamonds and gold, including jewellery - other goods which could enhance Russia's industrial capabilities Services Economic sanctions include a ban on providing the following services to Russia or to Russian nationals: - accounting, auditing, bookkeeping and tax consulting - architectural and engineering - IT consultancy and legal advisory - advertising, market research and public opinion polling - technical assistance, brokering or financial assistance relating to goods and technology covered by other sanctions - intellectual property rights or trade secrets relating to goods and technology covered by other sanctions - software for the management of enterprises and for software for industrial design and manufacture The above lists are not exhaustive. The full list of sanctions is available on the website of the EU official journal: - Regulation concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia's actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine (EU official journal) - Decision concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia's actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine (EU official journal) Restrictions on economic relations with specific areas The Council has adopted targeted economic measures in relation to specific areas, following: - the illegal annexation by Russia of Crimea and Sevastopol - Russia's recognition of the non-government-controlled areas of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson These measures include restrictions on: imports exports services The restrictive measures in response to the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol were introduced in 2014, and were most recently extended until 23 June 2025. The restrictive measures in response to Russia’s decision to proceed with the recognition of the non-government-controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in Ukraine as independent entities, and the subsequent decision to send Russian troops into those areas, were adopted in February 2022. In October 2022, these measures were extended to cover the non-government-controlled areas of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. They were most recently extended until 24 February 2025. - Regulation concerning restrictive measures in response to the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol (EU official journal) - Decision concerning restrictive measures in response to the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol (EU official journal) - Regulation concerning restrictive measures in response to the illegal recognition, occupation or annexation by Russia of certain non-government-controlled areas of Ukraine (EU official journal) - Decision concerning restrictive measures in response to the illegal recognition, occupation or annexation by Russia of certain non-government-controlled areas of Ukraine (EU official journal) Measures concerning economic cooperation In 2014 the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) decided that Russia would no longer be a recipient country, and stopped approving investments in that country. In the same year, the European Investment Bank (EIB) suspended the signing of new financing operations in Russia. EU bilateral and regional cooperation programmes with Russia were re-assessed and suspended. In addition, together with other members of the World Trade Organization, the EU agreed to deny most-favoured-nation treatment for Russian products and services on EU markets. Bans on media outlets Since 2022, the EU has suspended the broadcasting activities and licences of several Kremlin-backed disinformation outlets. These outlets have been used by the Russian government as instruments to manipulate information and promote disinformation about the military aggression against Ukraine, including propaganda aimed at destabilising the countries neighbouring Russia, the EU and its member states. - Izvestia - Katehon - New Eastern Outlook - NTV/NTV Mir - Oriental Review - Pervyi Kanal - REN TV - RIA Novosti - Russia Today and its subsidiaries - Rossiya RTR / RTR Planeta - Rossiya 24 / Russia 24 - Rossiya 1 - Rossiyskaya Gazeta - Spas TV Channel - Sputnik and its subsidiaries - Tsargrad TV Channel - TV Centre International - Voice of Europe The EU has also imposed sanctions on media organisations and individuals polluting the public space with disinformation. Funding of political parties in the EU Russia continually attempts to interfere with democratic processes in the EU and to undermine its democratic foundations, including through influence campaigns and by promoting disinformation. The EU has therefore decided that political parties and foundations, non-governmental organisations, think tanks, and media service providers in the EU will no longer be allowed to accept funding from the Russian state and its proxies. In line with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, these measures will not prevent media service providers and their staff from carrying out other activities in the EU, such as research and interviews. Diplomatic measures In 2014 the EU-Russia summit was cancelled, and EU member states decided to stop holding regular bilateral summits with Russia. Bilateral talks with Russia on visa matters were also suspended. Instead of the G8 summit in Sochi, a G7 meeting was held - without Russia - in Brussels on 4 and 5 June 2014. Since then, meetings have continued in the G7 format. EU countries also supported the suspension of negotiations over Russia joining the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the International Energy Agency (IEA). Suspension of visa agreement In February 2022, the EU decided that Russian diplomats, other Russian officials and businesspeople may no longer benefit from visa facilitation provisions, which allow privileged access to the EU. In September 2022 the Council adopted a decision that fully suspends the visa facilitation agreement between the EU and Russia. Consequently, the general rules of the visa code apply to Russian citizens. On 8 December 2022 the Council adopted a decision on the non-acceptance of Russian travel documents issued in Ukraine and Georgia. This decision came in response to Russia’s practice of issuing Russian international passports to residents of occupied regions. It also followed Russia’s unilateral decision to recognise the independence of the Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in 2008. Russian travel documents issued in, or to persons resident in, Russian-occupied regions in Ukraine or breakaway territories in Georgia are not accepted as valid travel documents for obtaining a visa or for crossing the borders of the Schengen area. Anti-circumvention measures Faced with the scale of the EU’s sanctions, Russian targets have deployed various techniques to circumvent them, such as using complex financial schemes, falsifying the nature or origin of the goods traded or relying on the jurisdictions of third countries. Listed persons and entities have also made efforts to conceal their assets. The EU has taken several measures to avoid and prevent circumvention, including: - strengthening bilateral and multilateral cooperation with third countries, and providing technical assistance - broadening the listing criteria to make it possible to target those who facilitate circumvention - sanctioning entities which are located in third countries and which are involved in the circumvention of trade restrictions The EU has introduced bans on: - the transit of dual-use goods, technologies and battlefield goods being exported from the EU to third countries via Russian territory - the re-exportation of particularly sensitive goods and technology to Russia and for use in Russia (the 'no Russia' clause) - access to EU ports for vessels engaged in ship-to-ship transfers and suspected of breaching sanctions and for vessels that are part of Putin’s shadow fleet - access to EU ports for vessels suspected of illegally interfering with or disabling their shipborne automatic identification system when transporting Russian oil The EU has required: - EU parent companies to ensure that their third-country subsidiaries do not take part in any activities resulting in an outcome that the sanctions seek to prevent - EU operators to implement due diligence mechanisms for selling battlefield goods to third countries - EU operators transferring industrial know-how for the production of battlefield goods to third countries to include contractual provisions to ensure that such know-how will not be used for goods intended for Russia To limit circumvention of the prohibition on the provision of crypto-asset wallet, account or custody services to Russian persons and residents, the EU introduced a ban on Russian nationals or natural persons residing in Russia from owning or controlling, or holding any posts on the governing bodies of, the legal persons, entities or bodies providing such services. In addition, notifications are now required for transfers of funds exceeding €100 000 outside the EU by any entity established in the EU that is owned or controlled by Russia. Hybrid threats from Russia Why sanctions? The European Union and its member states strongly condemn Russia’s intensifying campaign of hybrid activities. These activities illustrate Russia’s reckless and irresponsible behaviour and its disregard for the rules-based international order and international law. The EU has detected a broad range of hybrid activities, including cyber-attacks, information manipulation and interference campaigns, cases of arson, vandalism and sabotage and the instrumentalisation of migration. Russia also continues to disrupt satellite communications, violate European airspace and conduct physical attacks against individuals on EU territory. These malicious activities carried out by Russia are part of a broad and coordinated hybrid campaign to destabilise and weaken the EU and its member states and to undermine the EU’s support for Ukraine and its ability to defend itself. The EU is determined to address these activities and hold the perpetrators accountable. What are the sanctions? On 8 October 2024, the EU adopted a sanctions framework against those responsible for destabilising activities against the EU and its member states. The framework allows the EU to target individuals and entities engaged in actions and policies by the government of the Russian Federation, which undermine the fundamental values of the EU and its member states, their security, independence and integrity, as well as those of international organisations and non-EU countries. Thanks to the new sanctions regime, the EU can address a variety of hybrid threats, such as: - the undermining of electoral processes and the functioning of democratic institutions - threats against and sabotage of economic activities, services of public interest or critical infrastructure - the use of coordinated disinformation, foreign information manipulation and interference (FIMI) - malicious cyber activities - the instrumentalisation of migrants Currently 16 individuals and three entities are sanctioned under this regime. The list includes: - 'GRU Unit 29155', a covert unit within the Russian military intelligence agency - the disinformation network 'Groupe Panafricain pour le Commerce et l’Investissement' and its founder - the news agency 'African Initiative' and its editor-in-chief - individuals involved in the 'Doppelganger' campaign - collaborators of the Government of the Russian Federation in France and Germany Restrictive measures relating to hybrid attacks from Russia include travel bans for individuals, freezing the assets of individuals and entities and a prohibition on making funds or economic resources available to those listed.

A phalanx of masked men in military fatigues march up to the offices of a media outlet in Simferopol, the capital of Crimea. They are led by a young man wearing a long, black coat, his face uncovered. When the journalists inside refuse to open the door, the men in balaclavas smash a window and force their way in. But this was no movie. It was March 2014 and Russia had annexed the entire peninsula. Now a pro-Russian militia was taking over the region’s leading independent news source, the Crimean Center For Investigative Reporting. The man in the black coat announced that from now on this would be the headquarters of the “Crimean Front” militia, because, he said, from “this building does not come true information.” But, he added, staff could return to work if they agreed to report on events in the “correct, truthful” way. The journalists got the message, and fled to the Ukrainian capital, Kiev. And the new de facto pro-Moscow authorities in Crimea have barred any independent reporting by the Center’s journalists ever since. But for Konstantin Knyrik, the man in the black coat — then 25 years old — the raid was another stage in a burgeoning career as a Russian nationalist politician and information warrior. Today, he has traded the militia look for smarter clothes, more in keeping with his role as the editor-in-chief of a small but growing news agency called News Front. Set up just after Russia took control of Crimea, the agency has since carved out a reputation for its staunchly pro-Kremlin line and a steady output of stories which media monitors such as “Stop Fake” say are false or deliberately inflammatory. I traveled to Crimea to meet him. Knyrik says his site provides “an alternative source of information for people in Europe and the U.S.,” adding that he feels “sorry for the people who believe in this bullshit published by the mainstream media in the West.” But in an interview, he made clear that he sees himself as fighting in a conflict started by the West. “Information war was declared against Russia. It was not Russia who initiated the war.” A former News Front insider told the German newspaper Die Zeit that the agency is directly funded by the FSB, Russia’s main domestic intelligence service. Knyrik denies that, but there is no doubt that it is among the better-resourced players in the Russian media ecosystem, with a global reach. With 10 staff and at least 100 contributors around the world, it produces content in a growing range of languages, including Russian, English, German, French, Italian, Bulgarian and Spanish. Germany, Europe’s largest and most powerful state, has been a favorite subject for News Front’s stories — usually imbued with divisive spin. A report that ran last year, headlined “Refugee Crisis: Riots in Schorndorf” was a typical example. It claimed that thousands of teenagers, most of them “refugees and migrants,” had started a violent rampage through the city. But the story was false, according to Correctiv, a Berlin-based media-monitoring outfit which has been following News Front’s output. There had been an incident in the city, said Jacques Pezet, one of the Correctiv fact-checkers, but at most just a few dozen people had been involved and it was a mixed group, not only migrants. And when Correctiv looked into the dramatic photo used on the story — doing an image search on Google — he established that it hadn’t even been taken in Schorndorf. Instead, it had been lifted from a report on a totally unrelated protest in another German city at another time. It was a textbook case of “how a handful of actors can reach a significant amount of people with their false information,” said Pezet, adding that this was “part of a well-established pattern of anti-German and anti-Western disinformation in News Front’s stories.” As ever with fake news stories, the instigators have first-mover advantage and the Schorndorf “riot” story quickly spread, boosted and recycled by German far right politicians and conservative media outlets. At least 500,000 liked, shared or commented on the story according to one recent German study of fake news. And even if they cared, few people would ever have learned that the story had been invented. Asked for more details on how News Front reports on Germany, Knyrik refused, and declined to identify his main journalist there, citing security concerns. “I worry about his safety and the safety of all our volunteers,” he said. Another common theme in News Front’s output is its pro-Moscow stance. It all but matches the line taken by Kremlin-controlled outlets like Russia Today (RT) or Sputnik. The former insider who spoke to Die Zeit said some of the topics News Front covers are “assigned directly by the presidential administration in Moscow.” In his interview, Knyrik dismissed this allegation and insisted that his agency is only financed by donations from his family, friends and income from other business activities. Though he is Ukrainian, he grew up in a pro-Russian environment. His father Sergei Knyrik, a deputy on the local council in the Crimean city of Bakhchysarai, was head of several pro-Russian organizations in the peninsula. “Information war was declared against Russia. It was not Russia who initiated the war.” Konstantin Knyrik He was also a committed Eurasianist — backing the idea of creating a new Eurasian region or empire with Russia at its center. But even before he left school, Knyrik the son was showing signs of having grander ambitions. When he was just 17-years-old, he became head of the Crimean branch of the Eurasian Youth Union (EYU), set up the right-wing Russian ideologue Aleksandr Dugin. In 2006, he attended a summer camp Dugin organized for nationalist activists, according to political scientist Anton Shekhovtsov, who has followed these groups. Among the attendees, according to Shekhovtsov, were several people who would later play a key role in the Russian-backed “Donetsk People’s Republic,” one of the separatist territories in Eastern Ukraine. Dugin’s vision of Eurasia meant Russia regaining full control of the Crimean peninsula, with its access to the Black Sea. And in an interview, Knyrik made clear this was his strategy too. “Our first priority is to focus on creating an empire,” he said. “The first thing to do, is to tear Crimea away from Ukraine in order to save it. To attach it to the empire.” Even before Moscow annexed the peninsula in 2014, Knyrik was active on Vkontakte, Russia’s equivalent of Facebook, mobilizing support for Russian intervention. Today Knyrik wears several hats, in addition to his News Front job. He has followed his father in becoming a deputy on the same city council, and he is also chairman of the Crimean branch of Russia’s far-right Rodina party. It is one of the smaller parties in the Russian Duma or parliament, and espouses an ideology of patriotism and greater state involvement in the economy. And through the Rodina party and his news agency, Knyrik has indirect links to President Vladimir Putin himself. One of the party’s founders, Sergei Glazyev, is an advisor to the Russian leader, as well as a long-time friend of Knyrik’s News Front co-founder, Mikhail Sinelin. For a relatively small operation, News Front appears to be having significant impact. According to the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank that tracks disinformation and propaganda campaigns, News Front is one of the most active amplifiers of disinformation in Germany, along with RT and Sputnik. But rather than focusing so much on Russia, Knyrik says the West should be looking at its own record on freedom of expression. In his view, all the criticism it used to direct at the Soviet Union now applies to the U.S. and Europe. “There is total censorship and total absence of freedom of speech,” he said. The West’s real goal, said Knyrik, is “to start a real war after the information war.”",CREDIBLE

The conversation took place on September 13, 2020. - Ukraine and Austria have good relations, but two years ago Vladimir Putin was in Vienna, Austria, dancing at the wedding of the then Foreign Minister. I know that Ukraine, so to speak, was offended by this. Tell me, is the level of trust still low because of that wedding or has it been normalized? - Ukraine and Austria have long enough historic relations to react to a wedding. That would be trifling for Ukraine. You just reminded me of this wedding, and I've already forgotten that there was such an episode in history. Today, this can in no way affect relations between our countries. Yes, because we have a war in the east, because Austria always officially supports our sovereignty and territorial integrity, it seems to me, then it looked very strange in Ukraine. But what I see today… I have short relations with Kurtz (Federal Chancellor of Austria Sebastian Kurz - ed.) - the relations of our countries are longer - but very pleasant. He impresses me. I talked to him several times - all times were pleasant. We had an informal meeting in Munich, a very cool meeting with Pompeo (US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo) and Zuckerberg (American businessman Mark Zuckerberg). Then we agreed that I would definitely come on an official visit, because relations between our countries need to be restored and strengthened. - So, last year there were elections, Mr. Zelenskyy became the President, and many people said: ""This man was a comedian, he played in the movie, including the role of the President of Ukraine"". But it seems to me that it is still difficult to reformat from a comedian to a real president. How hard was it for you? - I will tell you frankly that when I got into politics, we saw that mostly politicians are even bigger actors and comedians than I was. Indeed, politics in Ukraine is very similar to the series. It is no coincidence that it was so popular. But everything is much more complicated than in the movie. Because there are a lot of challenges in Ukraine - the war in the east. It's real, it's not an episode of the movie. After the loss of a warrior in the movie they say ""cut"", and this man continues to live, and here everything is real. - When you were elected, voters had a lot of expectations from the President. You, in particular, spoke about the end of the war in Donbas. I know that a lot is being done for this, but you have not reached the goal yet. In this regard, there are voters who are disappointed in the President. So my question is: was what you promised related to reality? Was it your desire or populism? - What I promise is always not just words. I really want to do it and I give all my time to this. The war in the east and the return of our territories is a priority. Therefore, when you give your time, your mind, your desire - not just romantic, but real - I am sure that there is a result. Regarding the result. We returned about 150 people from captivity. We carried out disengagement (of forces and assets - ed.) at three sites, and despite the fact that people shouted that ""this cannot be done, there will still be shots in these areas,"" today there are no casualties, there are no shots. We restored the Normandy format and did our best to have a meeting of the leaders of the participating countries. Today there is a regime of ""silence"" - the longest since the beginning of the war in Donbas. Yes, indeed, on September 6 there was a violation by the militants, and we lost one person - after six weeks of ""silence"". Our fighters are always ready to fight back, but do not give in to provocations by the invaders. ""Silence"" lasts for the seventh week. Yes, unfortunately, there is one combat loss - my condolences to the family of the military. But this (observance of the armistice - ed.) is the fact, and it is seen by all - and in Europe in particular. There are such provocations as, for example, on September 11, when we talked to Ms. Merkel. There were provocative shots that day, but there were no combat losses, thank God. This is the longest regime of ""silence"" and the least number of combat losses since the beginning of the war. We understand that, in principle, there is a desire and confirmation to continue the implementation of the Minsk agreements and a desire to start a meeting of the leaders of the Normandy Four from this. The advisors met three days ago, and I know that there will be another meeting, and then, I believe, there will be a meeting of leaders. But if we adhere to - and this is important - a complete ceasefire, then we will be able to move on ""Minsk"" further. - Do you really think that it will be possible to return the territories? Or maybe the situation will be similar to the Moldovan one, when Transnistria is a ""gray zone"" and the conflict continues? - I know that some subjects want us to have a frozen conflict, similar to the situation with Transnistria or Abkhazia in Georgia - there are such cases in the territory of the former Soviet Union. The easiest way is to make Transnistria in Donbass, but Donbas, with all due respect, is not Transnistria. About three million Ukrainians live there. In Europe, there are countries (in terms of population - ed.) like our Donbas. We see the mood of many people there - they have low wages, they are not ready for COVID-19, no one knows the real situation with the pandemic, the real number of deaths due to coronavirus, there is a humanitarian catastrophe. And they see that life is much better in the liberated part of Donbas. Not perfect yet, unfortunately, but better. Today we supply water to Donbas, pay pensions. I know that due to the illegal issuance of passports, many people in the occupied part of Donbas also have Russian passports, so they receive pensions from both Ukraine and Russia. We all understand that this is a bad story and it cannot last forever. But such conditions were created when the war began, and without Ukraine it will be very difficult for Donbas. And once again I appeal to the number of people who live there - this is not Transnistria. There were businesses. Now they are embezzled. There are miners there, and they need to have salaries. There are simple things like utility bills, which are being increased there. There are such people in Donbas that will not be patient for too long. It could be an explosion. Donbas as it is, without the part we control, is not a completely separate region. Many people cross the border, visit our territory to see their parents and relatives, and then return. And they see the difference. We do our best to make them see the difference. We want to stop the war as soon as possible, but there may be an internal social explosion. Do you think I want a social explosion? No, I do not want that at all, because a social explosion inside the occupied Donbas will lead to a large number of deaths. This will be a very serious bloody internal conflict. We see this now, when in the occupied territory certain people with a pro-Ukrainian position go out on Independence Day with the Ukrainian flag, and then disappear somewhere together with the flags. They are thrown into prisons and tortured. Many of the people we released talk about who they were with in the neighboring cells - with ordinary people from Donbas who had a pro-Ukrainian position. I do not want a social explosion, we can lose tens of thousands of innocent pro-Ukrainian citizens. That is why I believe that the war must be ended as soon as possible, and today it depends on the parties to the ""Normandy Four"". It depends on Ukraine, but we all understand that it mostly depends on the Russian Federation. - A question concerning the domestic policy of Ukraine. When the Servant of the People party came to power, you said that ""we are amateurs, but it is good that we do not have old politicians who are corrupt"". Local elections will take place soon and, as far as I know, the Servant of the People has little chance of getting into local councils. Did the experiment fail? - First, these are different things. National elections in Ukraine are very different from local ones. Even the percentage of people who vote in the national elections varies greatly. There are more of them than those who vote in local elections. In any case, the Servant of the People will win the local elections on average throughout Ukraine. But the structure (of the process - ed.) is completely different. There is no competition between the parties. On the ground, they vote for those people who are famous there. In most cases, people vote for mayors who have already been in power. There are mayors who have worked for several consecutive terms. And that's why all these mayors - mostly old ones - turned to us and wanted to run for office under the Servant of the People party. We do not want to take them, despite the fact that they have a high rating, because we understand who they are. The party cannot be held responsible for what they do on the ground. Because we understand how they have been sitting for 10-20 years that during their term of office they were able to build only a park and a fountain. The party, having given them its flag and name, will not be able to change them as people. Therefore, we chose the option of betting on not very famous, but professional and decent people. Even if they lose, the party will still get enough votes to then show and defend some of our projects aimed at people in the city council. And then the people who will come to the polls will choose what they want - real change or another fountain. I say openly that today we can analyze all their (current mayors) activities in one example - these are quarantine measures due to COVID-19. The state has adopted a decision and a list of quarantine measures so that people can live, the economy and business can work. Social distance, masks, the ban on crowds, the order of travel in public transport, the work of restaurants - there are many such measures. But people do not like any ban. The mayors understand this, so many of them today, I think, do not help the state. They are engaged in populism, they give citizens an opportunity to do what they want, they allow large crowds of people - weddings and religious holidays, celebration of the days of the city when thousands of people gather. Therefore, I believe that people will choose between populism and the ""fountain"" and the real changes that may take place in their cities. This is very important, especially now when we are completing the decentralization reform, when there will be much more power on the ground than before. - The coronavirus crisis hit the country hard. I know that the situation in Ukraine is very serious with the economic crisis caused by coronavirus. I have data that the economy has fallen by 25%. How do you overcome this crisis? - COVID-19 really stopped Ukraine's economy, blocked it for six months. Jobs were lost, entrepreneurs could not withstand such a powerful blockade. There were no exports or imports. Large enterprises that could afford to keep people employed despite the fact that they were isolated at home and pay them wages first paid the full amount, then two-thirds, then a third… Indeed, there was an economic collapse, but not in Ukraine - all over the world. Yes, we have a crisis, but compared to Europe, the situation in Ukraine is quite good at the moment. In the second half of the year we expect a 10-11% decline in the economy, and we predicted 14%. Some of our economists said 25%, some said 8-9%. It is not easy for us, but the situation in Ukraine as a whole is not bad compared to other European countries. We do not print dollars, we do not have such an opportunity, but at the same time we are doing a lot now in real credit, mortgage programs, in the support of production. We are developing several programs of preferential lending to farmers and agriculture. I believe that we should create assistance programs. We have such an opportunity. For example, our program ""5-7-9%"". It is difficult to compare with Europe - loan rates are very small there, but here people took on loans at 20% rate. Now there is a program under which you can take a loan at 5, 7 or 9%. Yes, this is not the dream we are going for yet, but people have already received 6 billion hryvnias in loans. We support the economy as much as we can. - Now to Belarus, where the struggle for freedom is taking place. We all know the situation there. Is it possible to compare the current situation in Belarus with the Orange Revolution or the Maidan that took place in Ukraine? Will Belarus somehow be able to start playing a new geopolitical role - it is also located between Western and Eastern Europe? - I don't know whether it is possible to compare it with Maidan. In any case, I support the people of Belarus who really want change. They want to be free, democratic, to choose the leader they want. They want everything to be transparent. We do not see aggression, weapons, arson, attacks from them. But we all saw those who treated these people impudently, we saw law enforcement officers representing the authorities. If the state does not find a dialogue with its people who elect the leaders of the state, it will get, I can't say Maidan, because each country has its own history, but something similar to Maidan. The only thing we don't see yet is a symbol. In each similar case, the people had a leader (he or she does not matter), there was one around whom people gathered. I don't see this leader yet. But this is the exclusive right of the Belarusian people, and any country has no right to interfere in politics, in the elections of another country. - In the context of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, Belarus has played the role of mediator between Russia and Ukraine. Now, due to the situation in Belarus, relations between the countries have changed. Can Belarus continue to play this mediating role? - We will wait until the stabilization of the situation in Belarus. It's too early to tell. Due to COVID-19, all TCG meetings take place online. We will see. The citizens of Ukraine and Belarus have always been friendly, real brothers and sisters - and this is the most important thing. And our people will outlive all officials.",CREDIBLE

In addition, it commits Yerevan to guaranteeing their personal security and ensuring, if necessary, their free evacuation from the country. “Armenia attaches great importance to this and all other initiatives aimed at deepening our security cooperation with the European Union,” Deputy Foreign Minister Mnatsakan Safarian said on Tuesday as he presented the agreement to lawmakers for ratification. The EU mission was launched in February 2023 at the request of the Armenian government and with the stated aim of preventing or reducing ceasefire violations along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border. The EU decided late last year to increase the number of its members from 138 to 209. Russia, Armenia’s increasingly estranged ally, has opposed the mission from the outset, saying that it is part of U.S. and European Union efforts to drive Moscow out of the South Caucasus. Azerbaijan has also been critical of it. Last month, the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry summoned the EU ambassador in Baku to challenge the impartiality of the European monitors and warn them against causing “damage to Azerbaijan’s territorial integrity.” Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian’s government has repeatedly defended the mission, saying that it has succeeded in easing tensions along the long and volatile border. Hayk Konjorian, the parliamentary leader of Pashinian’s Civil Contract party, expressed the government’s “unequivocal satisfaction” with the mission during Tuesday’s debate on the ratification of the agreement. The document was backed by 57 parliament deputies representing Civil Contract. Twenty-seven opposition deputies abstained from the vote. Several deputies from the main opposition Hayastan alliance voiced reservations about granting the EU observers the special status which is not enjoyed by Russian troops and border guards stationed in Armenia. In particular, they noted that the agreement says nothing about the monitors’ mandate. Hayastan’s Gegham Manukian was concerned about the fact that the agreement allows monitors from non-EU countries to join the mission. “There is no restriction that bars a country like Turkey from becoming part of this mission,” he said. Parliament vice-speaker Ruben Rubinian assured Manukian that the EU cannot hire monitors from “third countries” without Yerevan’s consent. “This is regulated by an understanding between Armenia and the EU,” said Rubinian.",CREDIBLE

Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky was the most senior Ukrainian official killed since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion on Feb. 24. His first deputy also died in the crash. ""It is a truly great loss for the state,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his regular evening address. According to Zelensky, ""all the necessary decisions were made"" regarding the ministry's management. However, the people killed in Brovary ""are not those who can be easily replaced,"" Zelensky said. National Police Head Ihor Klymenko was appointed as the acting interior minister. The Security Service launched an investigation into the incident. Here is what we know about the incident so far. Who were the victims? At least 14 people were killed, including all 10 people onboard and four more on the ground. The 10 people aboard included seven Interior Ministry employees: - Denys Monastyrsky, interior minister - Yevhen Yenin, first deputy interior minister - Yuriy Lubkovych, the ministry's state secretary - colonel Mykhailo Pavlushko, Monastyrsky’s security chief - Andriy Marynchenko, senior police officer - Tetiana Shutiak, an employee of the ministry’s patronage service department - Mykola Anatsky, an employee of the ministry’s communications department The other three were crew members: helicopter crew commander Oleksandr Vasylenko, pilot Kostiantyn Kovalenko, and mechanic Ivan Kasianov. Five civilians, including one child, were reportedly killed on the ground as the helicopter crashed near a kindergarten. Where were the officials heading on the helicopter? According to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the President's Office, the Interior Ministry officials were en route to a ""hot spot"" of Russia’s war. Kharkiv Oblast Police Chief Volodymyr Tymoshko said the helicopter was headed to this northeastern region. Later, Ukrainska Pravda news outlet reported, citing unnamed sources, that the officials were heading to Bakhmut, a town in eastern Donetsk Oblast which has been the site of the fiercest fighting in the past months. The helicopter was supposed to land to refuel in central Poltava Oblast before finally reaching Kharkiv Oblast. From there, the group was supposed to travel by car about 200 kilometers southeast, to Bakhmut. Is it even possible to travel by helicopter in Ukraine now, during wartime? According to aviation expert Bohdan Dolintse, the use of helicopters by top officials during wartime is a ""completely justified step,” if such transport is not used within the range of the enemy's air defense systems. Dolintse told the Kyiv Independent that the risk of using aircraft is relatively low at a distance of up to 100-120 kilometers from the front line or the area where Russian air defense systems are located, which is the range at which they can effectively identify and destroy targets. ""When flying in the rear, there is still a risk of missile strikes. However, it is relatively low as aircraft can adjust their route after being notified of a threat, or apply other special action protocols,"" the expert explained. ""As ballistic or cruise missiles are programmed with coordinates before their launch, they can effectively target mainly only static (not moving) objects,"" Dolintse said. Also, to reduce the risk of being targeted by surface-to-air missiles, helicopters usually fly low, at levels undetectable by radars, according to BBC weapons expert Chris Partridge. ""Flying low also reduces the risk of the aircraft being attacked by other anti-aircraft systems, such as smaller shoulder-launched infrared weapons, when the aircraft enters a contested battlefield,"" he told BBC. Flying at low level, however, increases the risk of hitting the ground, Partridge added. ""This type of flight is intensive and quite stressful for pilots, especially in an urban environment with many structures such as buildings and trees,"" he explained. Isn't there a safety rule that top officials don't travel in the same vehicle? It is generally not forbidden by Ukrainian law to transport several top officials in the same vehicle. However, experts say that during wartime, governmental agencies were likely recommended not to concentrate several top officials in one vehicle if possible. ""But we have to understand that different circumstances and factors could influence the decision,"" aviation expert Bohdan Dolintse told the Kyiv Independent. ""There could be simply only one aircraft available at the moment, or some risk factors existing that we are not aware of,"" he said. What do we know about the helicopter? The Airbus H225 Super Puma helicopter that was carrying Interior Ministry officials belonged to the State Emergency Service, the agency said. ""The helicopter with board number 54 was repeatedly involved in carrying out tasks of transporting personnel to places of emergency situations,"" the statement reads. The agency stated that the aircraft's crew was prepared to perform tasks under difficult conditions and had the required number of flight hours precisely on Airbus H225 Super Puma vehicles to operate them. ""Among aircraft used by the Interior Ministry, this aircraft was most often used due to its ability to transport a sufficient number of people at the same time,"" the State Emergency Service added. Yurii Ihnat, the spokesperson of Ukraine’s Air Force, said that this type of helicopter was specifically used by the Interior Ministry and the State Emergency Service, and they were engaged in ""various special tasks,"" including ""those close to the areas of hostilities."" The Airbus H225 Super Puma helicopters were supplied to Ukraine by France as part of a 555 million euro contract signed by then-Interior Minister Arsen Avakov in 2018. The contract details were published by ProZorro, Ukraine's electronic public procurement system, designed to increase transparency and competition in the bidding process. Over the next three years, Ukraine received 55 Super Puma helicopters, 21 of which were the H225 model. This was part of a program to modernize Ukraine's aircraft fleet, which had previously mainly consisted of old Soviet vehicles. These helicopters were handed over to the State Emergency Service, the State Border Guard Service, the police, and the National Guard. The State Emergency Service used them to extinguish large-scale fires and in other emergency situations. Nearly a half of the helicopters were not brand new – they had a wear rate of 50% of some of the parts, were overhauled and modernized for Ukraine to use. Helicopters of this type are used by a number of Western countries such as France and Spain. What could have caused the crash? The Security Service of Ukraine, or SBU, opened an investigation that is currently considering several versions of what had caused the crash, including: violation of flight security rules, technical malfunction of the helicopter, and intentional actions to destroy the vehicle. At the same time, the air force spokesperson, Yurii Ihnat, said that the crash will be investigated by the special state commission that is yet to be created, and the process would take ""not a couple of days,"" but at least several weeks. ""Usually, a plane (or helicopter) crash investigations require a significant amount of time. This is a common practice not only in Ukraine but around the globe,"" Ihnat said. ""Every detail of the aircraft is collected and analyzed as it can provide important information about the incident."" Ihnat also noted that the weather conditions on Jan. 18 ""were not optimal."" On that day, the weather in Brovary was foggy and windy. While the Ukrainian authorities agree it is too early to say what exactly caused the fatal incident in Brovary, Zelensky said that, regardless of the reasons, ""it wasn't just an accident."" ""I believe, given my experience with war and the current state of our society, that this was not an accident – it was the war,"" he said in a video address to the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan. 18. ""War is not limited to the battlefield – it has many fronts. There are no mere accidents. Everything that happens is the result of war."" Is foul play suspected? Zelensky called on the Security Service chief to establish the circumstances of the crash and assured that the authorities would provide information on what led to the crash as soon as possible. The Prosecutor General's Office said ""all possible versions"" of the helicopter crash are on the table. ""The investigation will answer all the questions. It will take time,"" Acting Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said on Jan. 18. Didn’t the number of victims change several times? Information provided by rescuers, police, and local authorities varied throughout the day on Jan. 18. The most recent update, on Jan. 18 afternoon, suggested 14, including one child, had been killed after previous reports that the number of the killed children was at least four. Just after the crash, National Police Chief Ihor Klymenko said that 16 people were killed, including two children. National Police spokesperson Mariana Reva said on national television, 16 were killed, including three children. Kyiv Oblast Governor Oleksii Kuleba said on Jan. 18 that 18 people were killed, including three children. Two hours later, the Emergency Service reported 17 were killed, including four children. Finally, the Emergency Service updated the casualty information to 14 killed, including one child, and 25 injured, including 11 children. The agency said that the information was changing as the process of “identifying body fragments” was ongoing. All injured have been hospitalized, the Emergency Service said on Jan. 18. Who is Ihor Klymenko, new acting interior minister? Until Jan. 18, there were no discussions on who could be the potential successor of Monastyrsky. The late interior minister replaced his controversial predecessor Arsen Avakov in July 2021. Avakov spent seven years at the post. Monastyrsky had five deputies aside from late deputy Yenin who could take over the post, but the government selected National Police Chief Ihor Klymenko to serve as the acting interior minister. ""After discussions with the parliament, we will submit a proposal for the appointment of a new (permanent) minister,"" Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Jan. 18. Police General Klymenko, 50, has served as the head of the National Police since September 2019. Now, as an acting minister, Klymenko will oversee policing, security, and emergency services in Ukraine. Born in Kyiv, Klymenko graduated from the Kharkiv Military University in 1994. He served in Ukraine's Armed Forces for three years in the mid-1990s. Since 1998, Klymenko has served in different positions in the Interior Ministry, including one deployment as a peacekeeper in Kosovo in 2002. He has also served as a psychologist and got his Doctor of Psychology degree in 2019. In October 2017, Klymenko was appointed as Deputy National Police Chief to oversee the human resources department. During the full-scale Russian invasion, Klymenko provided frequent updates on the attacks and atrocities by the Russian forces. ""This tragedy should show us that the war is ongoing,"" Klymenko said on Jan. 18 as acting interior minister.",CREDIBLE

(Dec. 09, 2024) News • Working from these principles, Hitler carried his party from its inauspicious beginnings in a beer cellar in Munich to a dominant position in world politics 20 years later. The Nazi Party originated in 1919 and was led by Hitler from 1920. Through both successful electioneering and intimidation, the party came to power in Germany in 1933 and governed through totalitarian methods until 1945, when Hitler committed suicide and Germany was defeated and occupied by the Allies at the close of World War II. The history of Nazism after 1934 can be divided into two periods of about equal length. Between 1934 and 1939 the party established full control of all phases of life in Germany. With many Germans weary of party conflicts, economic and political instability, and the disorderly freedom that characterized the last years of the Weimar Republic (1919–33), Hitler and his movement gained the support and even the enthusiasm of a majority of the German population. In particular, the public welcomed the strong, decisive, and apparently effective government provided by the Nazis. Germany’s endless ranks of unemployed rapidly dwindled as the jobless were put to work in extensive public-works projects and in rapidly multiplying armaments factories. Germans were swept up in this orderly, intensely purposeful mass movement bent on restoring their country to its dignity, pride, and grandeur, as well as to dominance on the European stage. Economic recovery from the effects of the Great Depression and the forceful assertion of German nationalism were key factors in Nazism’s appeal to the German population. Further, Hitler’s continuous string of diplomatic successes and foreign conquests from 1934 through the early years of World War II secured the unqualified support of most Germans, including many who had previously opposed him. Despite its economic and political success, Nazism maintained its power by coercion and mass manipulation. The Nazi regime disseminated a continual outpouring of propaganda through all cultural and informational media. Its rallies—especially its elaborately staged Nürnberg rallies—its insignia, and its uniformed cadres were designed to impart an aura of omnipotence. The underside of its propaganda machine was its apparatus of terror, with its ubiquitous secret police and concentration camps. It fanned and focused German anti-Semitism to make the Jews a symbol of all that was hated and feared. By means of deceptive rhetoric, the party portrayed the Jews as the enemy of all classes of society. Nazism’s principal instrument of control was the unification, under Heinrich Himmler and his chief lieutenant, Reinhard Heydrich, of the SS (the uniformed police force of the Nazi Party) and all other police and security organizations. Opposition to the regime was destroyed either by outright terror or, more frequently, by the all-pervading fear of possible repression. Opponents of the regime were branded enemies of the state and of the people, and an elaborate web of informers—often members of the family or intimate friends—imposed utmost caution on all expressions and activities. Justice was no longer recognized as objective but was completely subordinated to the alleged needs and interests of the Volk. In addition to the now-debased methods of the normal judicial process, special detention camps were erected. In these camps the SS exercised supreme authority and introduced a system of sadistic brutality unrivaled in modern times. Between 1938 and 1945 Hitler’s regime attempted to expand and apply the Nazi system to territories outside the German Reich. This endeavour was confined, in 1938, to lands inhabited by German-speaking populations, but in 1939 Germany began to subjugate non-German-speaking nationalities as well. Germany’s invasion of Poland on September 1, which initiated World War II, was the logical outcome of Hitler’s plans. His first years were spent in preparing the Germans for the approaching struggle for world control and in forging the military and industrial superiority that Germany would require to fulfill its ambitions. With mounting diplomatic and military successes, his aims grew in quick progression. The first was to unite all people of German descent within their historical homeland on the basis of “self-determination.” His next step foresaw the creation, through the military conquest of Poland and other Slavic nations to the east, of a Grosswirtschaftsraum (“large economic unified space”) or a Lebensraum (“living space”), which thereby would allow Germany to acquire sufficient territory to become economically self-sufficient and militarily impregnable. There the German master race, or Herrenvolk, would rule over a hierarchy of subordinate peoples and organize and exploit them with ruthlessness and efficiency. With the initial successes of the military campaigns of 1939–41, his plan was expanded into a vision of a hemispheric order that would embrace all of Europe, western Asia, and Africa and eventually the entire world. The extravagant hopes of Nazism came to an end with Germany’s defeat in 1945, after nearly six years of war. To a certain extent World War II had repeated the pattern of World War I: great initial German military successes, the forging of a large-scale coalition against Germany as the result of German ambitions and behaviour, and the eventual loss of the war because of German overreaching. Nazism as a mass movement effectively ended on April 30, 1945, when Hitler committed suicide to avoid falling into the hands of Soviet troops completing the occupation of Berlin. Many Nazi scientists and technicians were then allowed to immigrate to the United States, because their expert knowledge was deemed critical to the defeat of Japan and, after the war, to the struggle against communism during the Cold War. Part of controversial programs such as Project Paperclip, some 1,500 German and Austrian professionals and their families relocated to the United States, the majority of them going on to become U.S. citizens. Out of the ruins of Nazism arose a Germany that was divided until 1990. Remnants of Nazi ideology remained in Germany after Hitler’s suicide, and a small number of Nazi-oriented political parties and other groups were formed in West Germany from the late 1940s, though some were later banned. In the 1990s gangs of neo-Nazi youths in eastern Germany staged attacks against immigrants, desecrated Jewish cemeteries, and engaged in violent confrontations with leftists and police. In the early 21st century, small neo-Nazi parties were to be found in most European countries as well as in the United States, Canada, and several Central and South American countries. They were rare, but not unheard of, in the rest of the world.",CREDIBLE

https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/crocus-city-hall-terrorists-were-financed-by-the-us-and-nato-via-ukraine/,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68657383,2024-03-25,"Moscow attack: Debunking the false claims Vladimir Putin has acknowledged ""radical Islamists"" carried out last week's deadly Moscow concert hall attack. But despite the Islamic State (IS) group claiming responsibility, the Russian president continues to insist Ukraine was involved. Through Russian officials' statements, media reports, and social media posts, BBC Verify examines how the campaign to blame Kyiv unfolded. First accusations Accusations were made almost immediately after initial reports of the attack on the Crocus City Hall emerged on social media at 1715 GMT on Friday. Several pro-Kremlin bloggers and some officials posting to the messaging app Telegram blamed Ukraine within just over an hour. Pro-Russia pundit Sergey Markov, for example, said at 1825 GMT the attackers looked like ""Islamist radicals"", but went on to add - without evidence - that the attack was ""likely organised from Kyiv"". Some 40 minutes later (1903 GMT), Moskovsky Komsomolets, a national tabloid, quoted military expert Roman Shkurlatov as saying the attack may have been organised with the support of Ukraine's Security Service and military intelligence. And at 1927 GMT, Russia's ex-President Dmitry Medvedev vowed revenge if Ukraine was involved. The fake claim of responsibility A few hours later, at 2213 GMT, NTV - one of Russia's main TV channels - aired a video clip, claiming that it showed a senior Ukrainian official confirming his country's involvement In the video, Oleksiy Danilov appears to say: ""It is fun in Moscow today, I think it's a lot of fun. I would like to believe that we will arrange such fun for them more often."" But BBC Verify has established the clip is actually an edit of two Ukrainian TV interviews broadcast in the past week. Both can be found on YouTube. The first is an interview with Danilov from 19 March. The other one was published three days earlier and features Ukraine's military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov. The quote by Danilov which appears in the NTV video cannot be heard in the original interview. Audio analysis, carried out for BBC Verify by the Advanced Forensic Technology Research Group at Liverpool John Moores University, suggests the audio was manipulated in the NTV video. A gap in the audio frequency data indicates that the sound has been edited. However, the researchers cannot be certain the voice was AI generated. BBC Verify has also found information embedded in the audio file suggesting it has been put through editing software. 'Window' for crossing An official accusation was made in Vladimir Putin's address on Saturday. The Russian president said the assailants were caught as they were trying to flee to Ukraine, where ""a window for crossing the border was prepared for them"". However, Russia has not presented evidence of a ""window"" to let the attackers through. Although BBC Verify cannot independently confirm where the suspects were heading, we have verified several videos and photos of them being apprehended. And despite Putin's claim, the arrests took place a long way from the Ukrainian border. By matching background details in their environment, we know two of the arrested suspects were filmed at about 90 miles (145km) from the Ukraine border. While Ukraine has denied any involvement, responsibility has been claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group via its self-styled Amaq news agency. Visual evidence, circulated by IS, includes a picture of four attackers with their faces blurred and a very graphic video filmed from one of the assailant's perspectives. Multiple details - like features of the concert hall and guns used by the attackers - match videos that emerged online at the time of the attack. But despite the evidence, Russia continues to accuse Ukraine. Margarita Simonyan - editor in chief of the Russian TV network RT (previously known as Russia Today) - said on X the attackers were not from IS because they were not wearing suicide vests and ""had no intention to die"". But while IS has repeatedly warned assailants against getting caught alive, the group's attackers have escaped before. For example, in late 2022 one of the militants involved in an attack on a hotel in Kabul managed to escape and later carried out a suicide attack, according to IS media observed by BBC Monitoring. What do we know about the suspects? The attackers drove in a white Renault - which matches the vehicle seen in a separate video used to flee the concert hall - before being detained. According to Russian State Duma deputy Alexander Khinshtein, one man was arrested near the vehicle, while the other three fled into nearby woods and were detained following a search. Weapons and Tajik passports were recovered from the Renault, Mr Khinshtein added. On Sunday, footage was published of the men being escorted into a Moscow court. They were named by Russian authorities as: Dalerdzhon Mirzoyev, Saidakrami Murodali Rachabalizoda, Shamsidin Fariduni and Muhammadsobir Fayzov. In the picture released by IS, three of the suspects can be seen wearing a light brown t-shirt, a light green t-shirt and a grey polo shirt. These shirts appear to match those worn by three of the suspects at the time of their arrest. For example, two logos on the light brown t-shirt worn by the man named Rachabalizoda are also visible in the video released by IS. He also identifies himself by the same name during a subsequent interrogation. The suspect Mirzoyev, whose shirt is not visible in the IS picture, was detained wearing a long-sleeve green shirt, blue jeans and a black belt. These three items of clothing are worn by a gunman in the IS video. How reliable is IS's claim of responsibility? The existence of a highly graphic video filmed by the attackers while carrying out the killings, their use of slogans common among IS attackers in the video, and its distribution via official IS media channels are consistent with the group's modus operandi. An image of one of the attackers inside the Crocus City Hall more than two weeks before the attack has been published by Russian media - suggesting it had been pre-planned. IS often awaits confirmation of the fate of the attackers before releasing a claim. If an attacker dies, it prevents the intelligence agencies from extracting information under interrogation or torture. So the claim of responsibility while the perpetrators were still at large is unusual, and indicates keenness on IS's part to confirm its role. This is not the first time that IS has targeted Russia. Two other major attacks happened in 2015 and 2018, along with other lower-level ones in recent years. Additional reporting by Mina Al-Lami, Benedict Garman and Adam Robinson",CREDIBLE
https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/armenia-is-under-the-control-of-the-most-anti-russian-transatlantic-forces/,https://www.britannica.com/place/Armenia/Nikol-Pashinyan-government#ref1262279,2025-01-11,"News • Because the Republican Party was still in control of the National Assembly, Pashinyan was eager to replace the legislative body with representatives who would reflect the popular movement that had put him in office. In October 2018 the National Assembly altered parliamentary procedures in a manner that would likely prevent an early election. Pashinyan led thousands in a rally outside the parliament building in protest, arguing that the current legislative makeup did not reflect the attitude of the country. Many observers noted Pashinyan’s apparent popularity. Pashinyan’s ally had won 81 percent of the vote in Yerevan’s mayoral election in September; the Republican Party had not put forward a candidate of its own, however. On October 16 Pashinyan announced his resignation as prime minister, forcing the dissolution of the National Assembly and triggering early elections. When elections were held on December 9, Pashinyan’s My Step Alliance won a landslide victory, taking more than 70 percent of the vote. The Republican Party received less than 5 percent of the vote, failing to meet the threshold that would allow the party to participate in the National Assembly. In mid-January 2019 Pashinyan’s new government was sworn in and set out on an ambitious agenda. It released a plan for economic reform, which had optimistic targets but was criticized for its vague details. Russia, Armenia’s powerful neighbour and largest trading partner, grew increasingly inimical to the new government. After Russia’s Gazprom hiked the price of natural gas to Armenia, Pashinyan visited Iran to discuss using Armenia as a potential transit point for Iranian gas. Armenia’s new government also raised hopes of a fresh start in negotiations with Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. A number of high-profile meetings culminated with the meeting of Pashinyan and Azerbaijani Pres. Ilham Aliyev in late March. A breakdown of diplomacy between the two countries, however, led to an escalation in tensions in mid-2020, including clashes in Nagorno-Karabakh in July. Those clashes prompted Armenia and Azerbaijan to make preparations for reprisals over the following months, and war broke out on September 27. The conflict, which saw the worst fighting since the mid-1990s, devastated Armenian forces. It came to an end on November 9 after Pashinyan agreed to withdraw Armenian forces and relinquish control over most of the region. Armenia faced an influx of thousands of Armenian refugees who fled the regions handed over to Azerbaijan, further straining an economy already affected by the military loss and the global COVID-19 pandemic. In the aftermath of the war, demonstrations broke out in Yerevan, and protesters stormed the parliament building, demanding the government’s resignation. Weeks later, Pres. Armen Sargsyan joined the call for Pashinyan to step down; the General Staff of the Armed Forces also called on him to resign several months later. In March 2021 Pashinyan agreed to an early election in June and formally resigned in April while remaining in a caretaker capacity. His most formidable election challenge came from Kocharyan, the former president, who attracted voters concerned with matters of national security. When the election was held, Pashinyan’s party, whose supporters were more motivated to vote in the polls, won more than half of the votes.",CREDIBLE

In the Russian Empire, Ukrainian publications and cultural organizations were directly suppressed and prominent figures arrested or exiled. As Russian forces advanced into Galicia in September, the retreating Austrians executed thousands for suspected pro-Russian sympathies. After occupying Galicia, tsarist authorities took steps toward its total incorporation into the Russian Empire. They prohibited the Ukrainian language, closed down institutions, and prepared to liquidate the Greek Catholic church. The Russification campaign was cut short by the Austrian reconquest in spring 1915. Western Ukraine, however, continued to be a theatre of military operations and suffered great depredation. The Russian Revolution of February 1917 brought into power the Provisional Government, which promptly introduced freedom of speech and assembly and lifted the tsarist restrictions on minorities. National life in Ukraine quickened with the revival of a Ukrainian press and the formation of numerous cultural and professional associations, as well as political parties. In March, on the initiative of these new organizations, the Central Rada (“Council”) was formed in Kyiv as a Ukrainian representative body. In April the more broadly convened All-Ukrainian National Congress declared the Central Rada to be the highest national authority in Ukraine and elected the historian Mykhaylo Hrushevsky as its head. The stated goal of the Central Rada was territorial autonomy for Ukraine and the transformation of Russia into a democratic, federative republic. Although the Provisional Government recognized Ukraine’s right to autonomy and the Central Rada as a legitimate representative body, there were unresolved disputes over its territorial jurisdiction and political prerogatives. Locally, especially in the Russified cities of eastern Ukraine, the Rada also had to compete with the increasingly radical soviets of workers’ and soldiers’ deputies, whose support in the Ukrainian population, however, was quite limited. Ukrainian-Russian relations deteriorated rapidly following the Bolshevik coup in Petrograd (now St. Petersburg) on November 7, 1917. The Central Rada refused to accept the new regime’s authority over Ukraine and on November 20 proclaimed the creation of the Ukrainian National Republic, though still in federation with the new democratic Russia that was expected to emerge from the impending Constituent Assembly. The Bolsheviks, in turn, at the first All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets, held in Kharkiv in December, declared Ukraine to be a Soviet republic and formed a rival government. In January 1918 the Bolsheviks launched an offensive in the Left Bank and advanced on Kyiv. The Central Rada, already engaged in peace negotiations with the Central Powers, from whom it hoped for military assistance, proclaimed the total independence of Ukraine on January 22; on the same day, it passed a law establishing national autonomy for Ukraine’s Jewish, Russian, and Polish minorities. Almost immediately, however, the government had to evacuate to the Right Bank, as Soviet troops occupied Kyiv. On February 9 Ukraine and the Central Powers signed the Peace Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (see treaties of Brest-Litovsk). A German-Austrian offensive dislodged the Bolsheviks from Kyiv in early March, and the Rada government returned to the capital. In April the Red Army retreated from Ukraine. The socialist policies of the Ukrainian government, especially land nationalization, conflicted with the interest of the German high command to maximize the production of foodstuffs for its own war effort. On April 29, 1918, the Rada government was overthrown in a German-supported coup by Gen. Pavlo Skoropadsky. A collateral descendant of an 18th-century Cossack hetman, Skoropadsky assumed the title “hetman of Ukraine” (which he intended to become hereditary), abrogated all laws passed by the Rada, and established a conservative regime that relied on the support of landowners and the largely Russian urban middle class. The new government aroused intense opposition among Ukrainian nationalists, socialists, and the peasantry. To coordinate political opposition, the Ukrainian National Union was formed by the main parties and civic organizations, while the peasants manifested their hostility through rebellions and partisan warfare. The capitulation of Germany and Austria in November removed the main prop of Skoropadsky’s regime, and the Ukrainian National Union formed the Directory of the Ukrainian National Republic to prepare for his overthrow. In a bid for the support of the Allied powers, Skoropadsky announced his intention to join in federation with a future non-Bolshevik Russia, triggering an uprising. On December 14 the hetman abdicated, and the Directory assumed control of government in Kyiv. Even before the collapse of Austria-Hungary, an assembly of western Ukrainian political leaders in October 1918 declared the formation of a state, shortly thereafter named the Western Ukrainian National Republic, embracing Galicia, northern Bukovina, and Transcarpathia. On November 1 Ukrainian forces occupied Lviv. This act touched off a war with the Poles, who were themselves resolved to incorporate Galicia into a reconstituted Polish state. The Poles took Lviv on November 21, but most of Galicia remained under Ukrainian control, and the government, headed by Yevhen Petrushevych, transferred its seat to Stanyslaviv (now Ivano-Frankivsk). On January 22, 1919, an act of union of the two Ukrainian states was proclaimed in Kyiv, but actual political integration was prevented by the ongoing hostilities. These ultimately took an unfavourable turn for the Ukrainians, and by late July the Poles were in full control of Galicia. Petrushevych and his government evacuated to Right Bank Ukraine and in the autumn went into exile in Vienna, where they continued diplomatic efforts against recognition of the Polish occupation. In Kyiv the Directory that had taken power in December 1918—initially headed by Volodymyr Vynnychenko and from February 1919 by Symon Petlyura, who was also the commander in chief—officially restored the Ukrainian National Republic and revived the legislation of the Central Rada. Its attempts to establish an effective administration and to cope with the mounting economic and social problems were stymied, however, by the increasingly chaotic domestic situation and a hostile foreign environment. As the peasants became restless and the army demoralized, partisan movements led by unruly chieftains (commonly known as otamany) escalated in scope and violence. In addition, a substantial irregular force emerged under the command of the charismatic anarchist leader Nestor Makhno. In many places the government’s authority was nominal or nonexistent. The Allied powers, including France, whose expeditionary force held Odessa, supported the Russian Whites, whose army was grouping around Gen. Anton Denikin in southern Russia. As authority broke down in Ukraine, random violence increased. In particular, a ferocious wave of pogroms against the Jewish population left tens of thousands dead. The majority of the pogroms occurred in 1919, perpetrated by virtually all regular and irregular forces fighting in Ukraine—including Directory troops, the otamany, the White forces, and the Red Army—as well as civilians from both the peasant and landowning classes. The Bolsheviks had already launched a new offensive in eastern Ukraine in December 1918. In February 1919 they again seized Kyiv. The Directory moved to the Right Bank and continued the struggle. In May Denikin launched his campaign against the Bolsheviks in the Left Bank; his progress westward through Ukraine was marked by terror, restoration of gentry landownership, and the destruction of all manifestations of Ukrainian national life. As the Bolsheviks retreated yet again, Petlyura’s Ukrainian forces and Denikin’s White regiments both entered Kyiv on August 31, though the Ukrainians soon withdrew to avoid overt hostilities. From September to December the Ukrainian army fought with Denikin but, losing ground, began a retreat northwestward into Volhynia. There, confronted by the Poles in the west, the returning Red Army in the north, and the Whites in the south, the Ukrainian forces ceased regular military operations and turned to guerrilla warfare. In December Petlyura went to Warsaw to seek outside support. At the same time, the Bolsheviks were beating back Denikin’s forces, and on December 16 they recaptured Kyiv. By February 1920 the Whites had been expelled from Ukrainian territory. Petlyura’s negotiations with the Polish government of Józef Piłsudski culminated in the Treaty of Warsaw, signed in April 1920; by the terms of the agreement, in return for Polish military aid, Petlyura surrendered Ukraine’s claim to Galicia and western Volhynia. A Polish-Ukrainian campaign opened two days later, and on May 6 the joint forces occupied Kyiv. A counteroffensive mounted by the Bolsheviks brought them to the outskirts of Warsaw in August. The tides of war turned again as the Polish and Ukrainian armies drove back the Soviets and reentered the Right Bank. In October, however, Poland made a truce with the Soviets, and in March 1921 the Polish and Soviet sides signed the Treaty of Riga. Poland extended recognition to Soviet Ukraine and retained the annexed western Ukrainian lands. (See also Russian Civil War; Russo-Polish War.) Ukraine in the interwar period In the aftermath of World War I and the revolutionary upheavals that followed, Ukrainian territories were divided among four states. Bukovina was annexed to Romania. Transcarpathia was joined to the new country of Czechoslovakia. Poland incorporated Galicia and western Volhynia, together with smaller adjacent areas in the northwest. The lands east of the Polish border constituted Soviet Ukraine. Soviet Ukraine The territories under Bolshevik control were formally organized as the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic (Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic [S.S.R.] from 1937). Under Bolshevik tutelage, the first All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets in December 1917 had formed a Soviet government for Ukraine; the second, in March 1918, had declared Soviet Ukraine independent; and the third, in March 1919, had adopted Soviet Ukraine’s first constitution. These moves, however, were essentially a tactical response to the demonstrable challenge of rising Ukrainian nationalism. With the consolidation of Bolshevik rule, Soviet Ukraine progressively ceded to Russia its rights in such areas as foreign relations and foreign trade. On December 30, 1922, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.)—a federation of Russia, Ukraine, Belorussia, and the Transcaucasian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic (S.F.S.R.)—was proclaimed. The first constitution for the new multinational federation was ratified in January 1924. Although the constituent republics retained the formal right of secession, their jurisdiction was limited to domestic affairs, while authority over foreign relations, the military, commerce, and transportation was vested in the Communist Party organs in Moscow. In point of fact, after the defeat of the Bolsheviks’ opponents, paramount power was exercised over all levels of government, as over the military and the secret police, by the Bolsheviks and their Communist Party apparatus (see Communist Party of the Soviet Union [CPSU]). The Communist Party itself brooked no concessions to the principles of independence or federalism and remained a highly centralized entity. Thus, at its founding congress in Moscow in July 1918, the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine, or CP(B)U, proclaimed itself to be an integral part of a single Russian (after 1924, All-Union) Communist Party and subordinated to its congresses and central committee, despite the efforts of such national-minded Bolsheviks as Mykola Skrypnyk to declare the CP(B)U an independent organization. As well as being subordinate to Moscow, the CP(B)U was overwhelmingly non-Ukrainian in ethnic composition: at the time of its founding, the membership of fewer than 5,000 was 7 percent Ukrainian. The Ukrainian component in the CP(B)U was strengthened in 1920 with the accession of the Borotbists, members of the “independist” and non-Bolshevik Ukrainian Communist Party that was formed in 1919. Still, in late 1920, Ukrainians constituted less than 20 percent of the CP(B)U’s membership. Largely alien in nationality and ideologically prepossessed in favour of the proletariat, the Bolsheviks enjoyed scant support in a population that was 80 percent Ukrainian, of which more than 90 percent were peasants. The New Economic Policy and Ukrainization Two main tasks faced the Bolsheviks in the 1920s—to rebuild the economy and to conciliate the non-Russian nationalities. The policy of War Communism—based on nationalization of all enterprises and the forcible requisition of food—wreaked economic havoc. Compounded by drought, it contributed to a famine in 1921–22 that claimed a million lives in Ukraine. In 1921 Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin introduced the New Economic Policy (NEP), which partially restored private enterprise in industry and trade and replaced grain requisitions with a fixed tax and the right to dispose of the surplus on the free market. By 1927 the Ukrainian economy recovered to the prewar level, and segments of the population enjoyed a measure of prosperity. In parallel with the NEP, the Bolsheviks took steps to appease, and at the same time to penetrate, the non-Russian nationalities. In 1923 a policy of “indigenization” was announced, including the promotion of native languages in education and publishing, at the workplace, and in government; the fostering of national cultures; and the recruitment of cadres from the indigenous populations. In Ukraine this program inaugurated a decade of rapid Ukrainization and cultural efflorescence. Within the CP(B)U itself, the proportion of Ukrainians in the rank-and-file membership exceeded 50 percent by the late 1920s. Enrollments in Ukrainian-language schools and the publication of Ukrainian books increased dramatically. Lively debates developed about the course of Ukrainian literature, in which the writer Mykola Khvylovy employed the slogan “Away from Moscow!” and urged a cultural orientation toward Europe. An important factor in the national revival, despite antireligious propaganda and harassment, was the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, which had gained a wide following among the Ukrainian intelligentsia and peasantry since its formation in 1921. Ukrainization was vigorously promoted by the “national communists,” including such Ukrainian Bolsheviks as Skrypnyk and Khvylovy, and especially by the former Borotbists, most prominently the people’s commissar of education, Oleksander Shumsky. The policy, however, encountered strong resistance from the non-Ukrainian leaders of the CP(B)U and party functionaries. The national revival also aroused concern in Moscow, where Joseph Stalin was strengthening his grip over the party apparatus. In 1925 Stalin dispatched his trusted lieutenant Lazar Kaganovich to head the CP(B)U. Within a year, Kaganovich engineered a split among the “national communists,” Khvylovy’s recantation, and the expulsion of Shumsky and his followers from the party. Nevertheless, with Skrypnyk as the new commissar of education, Ukrainization continued to advance. Industrialization and collectivization By the end of the 1920s, Stalin had launched a new “revolution from above.” The introduction of his first five-year plan in 1928 marked the end of the NEP and the onset of breakneck industrialization. In Ukraine this led to rapid economic and social transformation. By the outbreak of World War II, industrial output had increased fourfold, the number of workers had tripled, and the urban population had grown from 19 to 34 percent of the total. Though with a sectoral bias toward heavy industry and a regional concentration in the Donets Basin (Donbas) and central Dnieper area, Ukraine had undergone a remarkable industrial development. The cost of the accelerated industrialization was borne by the peasantry. In 1928 the regime introduced special measures against the kulaks (arbitrarily defined “wealthy” peasants). These progressed from escalating taxes and grain-delivery quotas to dispossession of all property and finally to the deportation, by the mid-1930s, of some 100,000 families to Siberia and Kazakhstan. Wholesale collectivization began in 1929, under duress from party activists and under threat of economic sanctions. The percentage of farms collectivized rose from 9 to 65 percent from October 1929 to March 1930 and exceeded 90 percent by the end of 1935. Mass resistance to collectivization—in the form of revolts, slaughter of cattle, and destruction of machinery—was answered by the imposition of ever higher delivery quotas and confiscation of foodstuffs.",CREDIBLE

Sources say Dr. Xiangguo Qiu, her husband Keding Cheng and her students from China were escorted from the level-4 lab on July 5, although the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) will only confirm a review is underway into an administrative matter and possible ""policy breach."" RCMP Manitoba received a referral from PHAC on May 24. A spokesperson says there is no threat to public safety and will not comment further while the investigation is ongoing. On Monday, the University of Manitoba ended the non-salaried appointments of both Qiu and Cheng, pending the police investigation. It has re-assigned an unknown number of graduate students working with Qiu, an adjunct professor in the department of medical microbiology. The university has also circulated a memo to faculty, which reads in part: ""Faculty members are encouraged to avoid all unnecessary travel to China (at this time) in light of our evolving relationship with China. The memo, sent by the office of Jay Doering, vice-president of research and international, added there are concerns because the university is being named in media coverage there. It had already suspended student and non-academic staff travel to China earlier this year when the federal government recommended a high degree of caution in traveling to China ""due to the risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws."" Canadian businessman Michael Spavor, who worked in North Korea, and former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig were picked up separately in December, shortly after the RCMP arrested Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver. The two men are accused of acting together to steal state secrets. China has also stopped importing some Canadian commodities since Wanzhou's arrest. ""Until more information is available, university-related student and non-academic staff travel to areas with changing travel advisories, such as China, is to be postponed. Faculty may wish to limit travel as well,"" the university memo reads. ""Our hope is that the situation will be resolved soon, and that this will not impact our many valued partnerships with Chinese institutions."" University spokesperson John Danakas declined further comment, saying: ""With an RCMP investigation ongoing, the university won't be able to provide more information at this time."" The travel restrictions seem to be excessive caution and may actually harm relationships, said Gordon Houlden, director of the University of Alberta's China Institute in Edmonton. However, he can understand why the university would make them. ""If you're an academic researcher and you're involved in research on really sensitive issues that would include Tibet, Xinjiang, leadership politics, religion in China, I would only do that in close conjunction with a Chinese university. So you're working with Chinese scholars, not freelancing,"" Houlden said. And while he also understands why PHAC, the RCMP and other agencies don't want to comment before the investigation is complete, Houlden said it would be helpful to provide a little more information, ""because without that, people begin to assume the worst and the worst may not be true."" ""What was the motivation? Was it an oversight? Was it a technical breach? Was it industrial espionage of the first order? Was it part of an organized plot, or did someone just send some research notes to a fellow researcher that was perhaps a technical breach but nothing more?"" he asked. ""We're left guessing, and clarity would help in terms of reassuring some people or at least being factual and accurate."" Qiu is a medical doctor and virologist who helped develop ZMapp, a treatment for the deadly Ebola virus. It was given to two infected medical missionaries during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Liberia, resulting in a full recovery. Qiu received her medical degree from Hebei Medical University in 1985 and came to Canada for graduate studies in 1996. She joined the NML's special pathogens program in 2003. - Doctor who survived Ebola visits Winnipeg to thank ZMapp scientists - American Ebola survivor visits Winnipeg Cheng is a biologist who has also done work on Ebola and has published research papers on HIV infections, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), E. coli infections and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome. Neither researcher could be reached for comment. The level-4 virology facility — the only one in Canada and one of only a handful in North America — is equipped to work with the most serious and deadly human and animal diseases, requiring the highest level of containment. More from CBC Manitoba: Corrections - A previous version of this story said the university was suspending travel to China for students and non-academic staff because of the investigation.

""We could put it under a U.N. mandate with a mission to prepare a fair referendum after establishing who the legal residents are and so on... And we could postpone it for 20 years,"" Sikorski suggested as one possible option, according to the news agency. Russia has illegally occupied Crimea since 2014, sparking international condemnations and sanctions. The peninsula remains internationally recognized as Ukraine's sovereign territory. ""Crimea is symbolically important for Russia, and especially for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, but strategically important for Ukraine. Therefore, I do not see how they will be able to come to an agreement without demilitarizing Crimea,"" Sikorski said. The Polish minister also voiced belief that the West made a mistake when it allegedly told Ukraine not to fight for Crimea in 2014. ""If Ukrainians had fought in Crimea, even symbolically, he (Russian President Vladimir Putin) would probably not have decided (to attack) Donbas,"" Sikorski said. Some of Sikorski's comments prompted a pushback in Ukraine, namely among the Crimean Tatar community. The Mejlis, the Crimean Tatars' chief executive-representative body, denounced the proposal about Crimea's status as ""unacceptable and cynical."" ""Crimea is a temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine, and the first step to establishing peace should be the withdrawal of the Russian occupying forces from the territory of the peninsula,"" the statement read. The Mejlis also considers any disputes on the ""legality"" of the peninsula's residents as ""unnecessary and inappropriate."" ""According to Ukrainian and international law, Crimea's 'legal residents' are exclusively citizens of Ukraine and persons who have established their permanent or temporary residence in accordance with Ukrainian legislation,"" the Mejlis said. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry later issued a statement saying that ""the territorial integrity of Ukraine has never been and cannot be a subject for discussion or compromise. Crimea is Ukraine. Period."" Up to 800,000 Russian citizens have illegally settled in Crimea since the start of the occupation in 2014, Ukrainian authorities said last year. Russia's rule has also been accompanied by systematic repression and persecution of Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars. ""Crimea is Ukraine. Russia has violated international law and must be held accountable for it,"" Presidential Office head Andrii Yermak said on his Telegram channel on Sept. 19, without explicitly referencing Sikorski's comments. Tamila Tasheva, the presidential representative for Crimea, called the minister's statements ""unfortunate, especially in view of the events that have taken place since 2014."" ""After the illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014, the inhabitants of the peninsula suffered systematic human rights violations, persecution, and repression,"" Tasheva said. ""This especially applies to Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians who face discrimination, illegal detentions, and restrictions on freedom of speech and religion."" Ukraine stands firm on its 10-point peace plan that includes the full restoration of territorial integrity, Tasheva said, voicing hope for ""further solidarity and support from our international partners in countering aggression and protecting the principles of international law."" While Poland has been a key ally to Ukraine during the full-scale war with Russia, Sikorski's trip to Kyiv was accompanied by an uneasy atmosphere. President Volodymyr Zelensky's meeting with Sikorski on Sept. 13 ""was extremely tense; it could even be described as a dispute,"" the Polish outlet Onet wrote. The Polish delegation was reportedly taken aback by Zelensky's tone, who criticized the supposed lack of Warsaw's support in Ukraine's EU integration and called for greater military supplies. Ukraine's head of state also reportedly called out Polish leaders for bringing up the matter of the Volyn massacre in the current situation. This refers to the 1943 massacre of tens of thousands of Poles by members of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) in Nazi-occupied Volyn, a region that used to be part of Poland and is now part of Ukraine. Thousands of Ukrainians were killed in retaliation. Kyiv and Warsaw did not publically confirm any dispute during the talks.",CREDIBLE

The Visit consisted of the delivery of 70 LCD 3.3 detectors – advanced warning devices that alert to gas and vapour threats detected and identified at or below levels immediately dangerous to life and health. The detectors determine the agent or type of chemical exposure, as well as the class, concentration and dosage. OPCW experts also provided training on how to use the detectors for 20 experts from the Ukrainian State Emergency Service, including first responders, firefighters, and medics. The training took place in Uzhhorod, Ukraine. This Visit was organised following a request made by Ukraine and following the entry into force, on 24 May, of the ad hoc Privileges and Immunities Agreement signed between Ukraine and the OPCW. All expenses related to the provision of the equipment were covered by voluntary contributions made by OPCW Member States to the Article X Trust Fund for the provision of assistance and protection to Ukraine upon its request. To date, EUR 3.9 million of voluntary contributions to the Fund have been made by 15 States Parties, of which EUR 2.4 million have already been used or committed. Between September 2023 and May 2024, the Secretariat conducted an online specialised course composed of several modules on “Emergency Response to Incidents Involving Toxic Chemicals” for 32 first responders in Ukraine. From 17 to 28 June 2024, the Secretariat conducted specialised training courses on “Sampling for Investigation of Chemical Weapon Use” to 40 Ukrainian experts at the OPCW Centre for Chemistry and Technology. Background The Secretariat of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has been monitoring the situation on the territory of Ukraine since the start of the war in February 2022 in relation to allegations of use of toxic chemicals as weapons. Both the Russian Federation and Ukraine have accused one another and reported allegations of use of chemical weapons to the Organisation. The information provided to the Organisation so far by both sides, together with the information available to the Secretariat, is insufficiently substantiated. Article X of the Chemical Weapons Convention provides for assistance and protection to a State Party if it is attacked or threatened with attack by chemical weapons. As the implementing body for the Chemical Weapons Convention, the OPCW, with its 193 Member States, oversees the global endeavour to permanently eliminate chemical weapons. Since the Convention’s entry into force in 1997, it is the most successful disarmament treaty eliminating an entire class of weapons of mass destruction. In 2023, the OPCW verified that all chemical weapons stockpiles declared by the 193 States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention since 1997 — totalling 72,304 metric tonnes of chemical agents — have been irreversibly destroyed under the OPCW’s strict verification regime. For its extensive efforts in eliminating chemical weapons, the OPCW received the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize.",CREDIBLE

A joint investigation team is an international cooperation tool based on an agreement between competent authorities – both judicial (judges, prosecutors, investigative judges…) and law enforcement – of two or more States, established for a limited duration and for a specific purpose, to carry out criminal investigations in one or more of the involved States. JITs are now an established efficient and effective cooperation tool amongst national investigative agencies when tackling cross-border crime. They facilitate the coordination of investigations and prosecutions conducted in parallel across several States. The terms in accordance with which a JIT operates vary from case to case, but they are based on the model JIT agreement as appended to Council Resolution (2017/C 18/01). This resolution “encourages the competent authorities of the Member States that wish to set up a Joint Investigation Team with the competent authorities from other Member States, in accordance with the terms of the Framework Decision and the Convention, or from non-EU States, on the basis of the relevant international instruments, to use, where appropriate, the Model Agreement […] in order to agree upon the modalities for the joint investigation team”. How JITs operate in practice Here’s how JITs work: the competent authorities in one or more Member States, joined as noted above by authorities from outside the EU, may decide to set up a JIT for a specific purpose and for a limited period (which may be extended by mutual agreement). A JIT team can consist of: - law enforcement officers; - prosecutors; - judges; - other relevant personnel. The JIT is led by a member from the country in which the JIT is based. And it is the law of that country that governs the JIT’s activities. Europol’s role Europol supports JITs in a number of ways, such as by: - showing the big picture: identifying links between related cases and investigations; - liaising directly with JIT members; - providing members with information that Europol maintains; - offering analytical and logistical support, and technical and forensic expertise; - supporting the secure exchange of information.

https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/france-to-propose-new-sanctions-based-on-more-false-accusations-against-russia/,https://therecord.media/russia-state-hackers-deploying-malware-nato,2024-01-18,"Google: Russian state hackers deploying malware in espionage attacks around Europe Russian state hackers are increasingly attempting to deploy backdoors on the devices of targets in NATO countries and Ukraine, according to new research from Google’s Threat Analysis Group. The researchers found that the tactics of hackers from Center 18, a unit within Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), have evolved in recent months to more sophisticated efforts involving .pdf files. The researchers dub the hackers COLDRIVER and said that since November 2022 they have lured victims into downloading backdoors onto their devices through the documents. For years, Center 18 has been a key part of the Russian government’s hacking operations, participating in efforts to compromise systems used by the U.S. government, among others. A Google spokesperson told Recorded Future News that the main targets are high-profile individuals in NGOs, former intelligence and military officials and NATO governments. COLDRIVER actors typically approach victims pretending to be experts in a field of study or members of organizations affiliated with the target of the operation. As in many other sophisticated espionage efforts, the hackers attempt to build a relationship with the victim in an effort to get them to open documents. “As far back as November 2022, TAG has observed COLDRIVER sending targets benign PDF documents from impersonation accounts. COLDRIVER presents these documents as a new op-ed or other type of article that the impersonation account is looking to publish, asking for feedback from the target. When the user opens the benign PDF, the text appears encrypted,” TAG said. “If the target responds that they cannot read the encrypted document, the COLDRIVER impersonation account responds with a link, usually hosted on a cloud storage site, to a ‘decryption’ utility for the target to use. This decryption utility, while also displaying a decoy document, is in fact a backdoor, tracked as SPICA, giving COLDRIVER access to the victim’s machine.” The researchers said SPICA is the first custom malware whose development and use has been attributed to COLDRIVER. SPICA allows the hackers to steal cookies from Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Edge, and to upload, download, enumerate and exfiltrate documents. SPICA was first seen in September 2023 but researchers said they believe the malware has been used since November 2022. “While TAG has observed four different variants of the initial ‘encrypted’ PDF lure, we have only been able to successfully retrieve a single instance of SPICA,” they said. “We believe there may be multiple versions of the SPICA backdoor, each with a different embedded decoy document to match the lure document sent to targets.” Researchers said Google has tried to disrupt the campaign by adding all known domains and hashes to Safe Browsing blocklists. Google said it has also sent “all targeted Gmail and Workspace users government-backed attacker alerts notifying them of the activity” and warned them to enable Enhanced Safe Browsing for Chrome. Google cited recent reports from Microsoft and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in December that highlighted the group’s tactics, including the abuse of webmail addresses from Outlook, Gmail, Yahoo and Proton to target defense agencies, academia, governmental organizations, NGOs, think tanks and politicians. Google’s TAG released a report in 2022 accusing COLDRIVER actors of targeting several U.S.-based NGOs, think-tanks, the military of a Balkan country and a Ukrainian defense contractor with credential phishing campaigns. Two members of Center 18 — officers Ruslan Aleksandrovich Peretyatko and Andrey Stanislavovich Korinets — were charged by the U.S. Justice Department for their alleged role in targeting U.S. government and military officials as part of a hacking campaign also aimed at the United Kingdom, Ukraine and NATO.

French President Emmanuel Macron has said that sending Western ground troops to Ukraine could not be “ruled out” as European allies announced new measures to deliver munitions and boost Kyiv in its fight against Russia. The comments on Monday came after some 20 European leaders gathered in Paris to send Russian President Vladimir Putin a message of European resolve on Ukraine and counter the Kremlin’s narrative that Moscow was bound to win a war now in its third year. Keep reading list of 3 itemsNavalny was close to being freed from prison before his death, says ally Hungary ratifies Sweden’s NATO bid, clearing final obstacle to membership “We are convinced that the defeat of Russia is indispensable to security and stability in Europe,” Macron told reporters after the meeting. “There’s no consensus today to send in an official, endorsed manner troops on the ground. But in terms of dynamics, nothing can be ruled out,” he said. “We will do everything that we must so that Russia does not win.” Macron declined to provide details about which nations were considering sending troops, saying he prefers to maintain some “strategic ambiguity”. A White House official told the Reuters news agency that the United States had no plans to send troops to fight in Ukraine and that there were also no plans to send NATO troops to fight in Ukraine. The conference in Paris signalled Macron’s eagerness to present himself as a European champion of Ukraine’s cause, amid growing fears that US support could wane in the coming years. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Poland’s President Andrzej Duda were among the European heads of state and government present at the conference, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy joined virtually. Duda said the most heated discussion was about whether to send troops to Ukraine and “there was no agreement on the matter”. “Opinions differ here, but there are no such decisions,” he said. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, who has opposed military aid to Ukraine, meanwhile said several NATO and European Union members were considering sending soldiers to Ukraine on a bilateral basis. “I can confirm there are countries that are prepared to send their own troops to Ukraine, there are countries that say never, among which Slovakia belongs, and there are countries that say this proposal needs to be considered,” he said before boarding his plane home. The conference was called as Ukraine suffered setbacks on eastern battlefields, with its generals complaining of shortages of arms and soldiers. It saw progress on a Czech-led initiative to buy hundreds of thousands of ammunition rounds from third countries, something that France has been cautious about as it wants to prioritise developing Europe’s own industry. Ammunition supplies have become a critical issue for Kyiv. The EU, though, is falling short of its target of sending Ukraine a million rounds of artillery shells by March. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said about 15 countries had agreed to sign up to his initiative. “We are talking about hundreds of thousands of pieces of ammunition we should and could get in relatively short time,” Fiala told reporters. Defence ministers had been mandated to come up with a plan within the next 10 days, Portugal’s Prime Minister Antonio Costa said. Rutte said the Netherlands would contribute 100 million euros ($108.5m) for the purchase of munitions overseas. He said the countries that would provide the munitions had asked not to be identified. “I think there was a great sense of urgency, particularly for the short term on ammunition and on air defence,” Rutte said. “I hope other countries will follow.” Macron also announced a new coalition would be set up to supply Ukraine with “missiles and bombs of medium and long range to carry out deep strikes”. There was a “broad consensus to do more and quicker”, he added, saying there was also a consensus to ramp up joint production of armaments with Ukraine and boost its own military industry. The Paris conference comes after France, Germany and the UK recently signed 10-year bilateral agreements with Ukraine to send a strong signal of long-term backing as Kyiv works to shore up Western support.",CREDIBLE

https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/for-235-years-crimea-is-russias/,https://www.britannica.com/event/Crimean-War,2024-11-18,"Crimean War - Date: - October 4, 1853 - February 1, 1856 - Location: - Crimean Peninsula - Ukraine - Participants: - France - Ottoman Empire - Sardinia - United Kingdom - Russian Empire - Context: - Russo-Turkish wars Who fought the Crimean War? What led to the Crimean War? What was the outcome of the Crimean War? How many people died in the Crimean War? How did the Crimean War affect the future treatment of wounded soldiers? Crimean War, (October 1853–February 1856), war fought mainly on the Crimean Peninsula between the Russians and the British, French, and Ottoman Turkish, with support from January 1855 by the army of Sardinia-Piedmont. The war arose from the conflict of great powers in the Middle East and was more directly caused by Russian demands to exercise protection over the Orthodox subjects of the Ottoman sultan. Another major factor was the dispute between Russia and France over the privileges of the Russian Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches in the holy places in Palestine. Supported by Britain, the Turks took a firm stand against the Russians, who occupied the Danubian principalities (modern Romania) on the Russo-Turkish border in July 1853. The British fleet was ordered to Constantinople (Istanbul) on September 23. On October 4 the Turks declared war on Russia and in the same month opened an offensive against the Russians in the Danubian principalities. After the Russian Black Sea fleet destroyed a Turkish squadron at Sinope, on the Turkish side of the Black Sea, the British and French fleets entered the Black Sea on January 3, 1854, to protect Turkish transports. On March 28 Britain and France declared war on Russia. To satisfy Austria and avoid having that country also enter the war, Russia evacuated the Danubian principalities. Austria occupied them in August 1854. In September 1854 the allies landed troops in Russian Crimea, on the north shore of the Black Sea, and began a yearlong siege of the Russian fortress of Sevastopol. Major engagements were fought at the Alma River on September 20, at Balaklava on October 25 (commemorated in “The Charge of the Light Brigade” by English poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson), and at Inkerman on November 5. On January 26, 1855, Sardinia-Piedmont entered the war and sent 10,000 troops. Finally, on September 11, 1855, three days after a successful French assault on the Malakhov, a major strongpoint in the Russian defenses, the Russians blew up the forts, sank the ships, and evacuated Sevastopol. Secondary operations of the war were conducted in the Caucasus and in the Baltic Sea. After Austria threatened to join the allies, Russia accepted preliminary peace terms on February 1, 1856. The Congress of Paris worked out the final settlement from February 25 to March 30. The resulting Treaty of Paris, signed on March 30, 1856, guaranteed the integrity of Ottoman Turkey and obliged Russia to surrender southern Bessarabia, at the mouth of the Danube. The Black Sea was neutralized, and the Danube River was opened to the shipping of all nations. The Crimean War was managed and commanded very poorly on both sides. Disease accounted for a disproportionate number of the approximately 250,000 casualties lost by each side, and, when news of the deplorable conditions at the front reached the British public, nurse Mary Seacole petitioned the War Office for passage to Crimea. When she was refused, Seacole financed the trip to Balaklava herself and established the British Hotel, an officer’s club and convalescent home that she used as a base to treat the sick and wounded on the battlefield. Improvements made to the field hospital at Üsküdar by British nurse Florence Nightingale revolutionized the treatment of wounded soldiers and paved the way for later developments in battlefield medicine. The war did not settle the relations of the powers in eastern Europe. It did awaken the new Russian emperor Alexander II (who succeeded Nicholas I in March 1855) to the need to overcome Russia’s backwardness in order to compete successfully with the other European powers. A further result of the war was that Austria, having sided with Great Britain and France, lost the support of Russia in central European affairs. Austria became dependent on Britain and France, which failed to support that country, leading to the Austrian defeats in 1859 and 1866 that, in turn, led to the unification of Italy and of Germany.",CREDIBLE

Any commercial use of this content requires a subscription. Click here to find out more. “Corona virus developed in Canada and stolen by China?” reads the headline of this article from January 22, 2020. It appears to be the first of a series of such claims about the coronavirus, which caused an outbreak in the central Chinese city of Wuhan before spreading elsewhere in the country and around the world. Other social media users soon shared similar versions of the claim, referring to the investigation of two Chinese virologists in Canada in 2019. Kyle Bass, an American hedge fund manager who was shorting Hong Kong’s currency, falsely claimed on Twitter that a “Chinese spy team” sent pathogens “to the Wuhan facility.” He was retweeted 12,500 times, and screenshots of the tweet were shared on Facebook. The claims appear to be based on a mischaracterization of August 2019 reports about a transfer of Ebola and Henipah viruses from a Canadian lab to China, and an investigation involving two researchers at Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg, in the central province of Manitoba. The NML is part of the federal Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), whose senior media officer Tammy Jarbeau told AFP in January 2020 that “this is disinformation. (These) statements made on social networks have no factual basis.” The RCMP investigation In July 2019, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that two researchers with ties to China were removed from the NML in Winnipeg by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) for a possible “policy breach.” The article did not mention the coronavirus. Robert Cyrenne, spokesman for the RCMP in Manitoba, told AFP in January 2020 that “there is no connection between the outbreak in China and any RCMP investigation. Any reporting of such is misinformation.” Dr Xiangguo Qiu, who helped develop a treatment for the Ebola virus, her husband Keding Cheng, a biologist who has published papers on coronavirus strains such as SARS-CoV, and Chinese students working under them had their security access revoked for Canada’s only Level-4 lab, a facility equipped for research on the deadliest diseases. CBC later found through an access to information request that Qiu was responsible for a shipment of Ebola and Henipah viruses to the Wuhan Institute of Virology four months before she and her husband were escorted from the NML. These pathogens are not coronaviruses. The University of Manitoba, with which Qiu and Cheng were affiliated, ended their non-salaried appointments and re-assigned the students working with them, a spokesperson told the Canadian Press. In February 2021, CBC reported that the couple were let go from the lab. The RCMP did not comment on the current whereabouts of Qiu and Cheng for privacy reasons. Origin of the virus In a letter published on February 19, 2020 in The Lancet medical journal, a group of public health scientists made a statement about the origins of the coronavirus, which causes the Covid-19 disease. “Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife, as have so many other emerging pathogens,” they said. A team of scientists led by Shan-Lu Liu of The Ohio State University also concluded that there is no “credible evidence” that the virus -- officially known as SARS-CoV-2 -- was engineered in a laboratory, in research published on February 26, 2020. Suggestions that the virus emanated from a laboratory gained renewed attention in 2021. Such claims remain unproven, but US President Joe Biden on May 26 ordered intelligence agencies to report to him within 90 days on the origin of Covid-19. AFP Fact Check’s articles about Covid-19 can be found here.

Human rights organizations say the bombing campaign is targeting an area where 400,000 civilians live. On February 22, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called the situation in eastern Ghouta “a human tragedy,” saying the U.N. cannot “let things go on happening in this horrendous way,” he said. Warplanes struck eastern Ghouta overnight February 22-23 even as Russia objected to a draft U.N. resolution to implement a 30-day pause in fighting across Syria. Diplomats say the purpose of the resolution is to lift the siege of eastern Ghouta to allow humanitarian aid and medical evacuations. Saturday, the U.N. Security Council in New York adopted a resolution calling for a cease fire, demanding hostilities cease in Syria ""without delay"" and for 30-days to allow humanitarian aid to be delivered and to evacuate the critically ill and injured. The resolution, itself, was delayed more than 24 hours as diplomats negotiated to settle on language acceptable to Russia. U.S. Ambassador Niki Haley expressed her skepticism that Syria would comply and admonished Russia for stalling U.N. action. ""Every minute this council waited on Russia, the human suffering grew,"" Haley said. ""In the three days it took us to adopt this resolution, how many mothers lost their kids to the bombing and shelling?"" Earlier, Western officials placed responsibility on Russia for the humanitarian emergency in eastern Ghouta. “Without Russia backing Syria, the devastation and the deaths would certainly not be occurring,” U.S. State Department Spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on February 22. The White House said the U.S. “strongly condemns “recent attacks on the people of Syria in eastern Ghouta by Russia and the Assad regime.” The German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the bombing of eastern Ghouta a “massacre.” That same day, amid growing international criticism, President Vladimir Putin praised the performance of the Russian military in Syria: “I would like to once again thank for their service all who participated and are participating in the military actions in the Syrian Arab Republic. Our warriors are splendidly prepared, they are honorably doing their duty, fighting decisively, fearlessly, to the end!” Putin said. While formally advocating for ceasefire and peace negotiations in Syria, Russia continues taking steps that, experts say, are causing a further escalation of violence. And February 22, Russia blocked the first draft of a U.N. resolution calling for a ceasefire. Russia’s envoy to the U.N., Vassily Nebenzia, stated that international media reports of heavy civilian casualties in eastern Ghouta was a product of “mass psychosis."" Russia circulated proposed amendments that some reports indicated would create loopholes in a ceasefire. Russia has vetoed 10 earlier U.N. resolutions on Syria. Earlier, on February 21, Kommersant.ru, citing sources in the Russian Defense Ministry, reported that Moscow has deployed an unknown number of Su-57s, its most advanced combat warplane, to Syria. Nicknamed the “F-22 killer,” the Russian military sees the Su-57 as a direct competitor to the U.S. F-22 Raptor. “With the arrival of the Su-57s, it appears that Moscow is expecting major escalations in Syria during 2018,” reported Beirut-based Al-Masdar News, which boasts close links with the Syrian military.",CREDIBLE

SFOR helped to maintain a secure environment and facilitate the country’s reconstruction in the wake of the 1992-1995 war. - NATO conducted its first major crisis response operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. - NATO implemented the military aspects of the Dayton Peace Agreement, which marked the end of the 1992-1995 war in the country. - The NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) was deployed in December 1995 and was followed by the NATO-led Stabilisation Force (SFOR), which ended in December 2004. - Once NATO had successfully implemented the military aspects of the Dayton Peace Agreement, the European Union (EU) took on NATO’s stabilisation role. - NATO maintains a military headquarters in Sarajevo that complements the work of the EU mission and assists, inter alia, in defence reform and counter-terrorism. - Bosnia and Herzegovina became a NATO partner country in December 2006 and is focusing on introducing democratic, institutional and defence reforms, as well as developing practical cooperation in other areas. - Aim and implementation of IFOR and SFOR - Command of the missions - The evolution of NATO’s assistance - Facts and figures Aim and implementation of IFOR and SFOR IFOR The Implementation Force (IFOR) was deployed in Bosnia and Herzegovina in December 1995 with a one-year mandate. IFOR operated under Chapter VII of the United Nations (UN) Charter, deriving its authority from UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1031 of 15 December 1995. This gave it a mandate not just to maintain peace, but also, where necessary, to enforce it. As such, IFOR was a peace enforcement operation, which was more generally referred to as a peace support operation. This was also the case for SFOR. - IFOR’s aim IFOR aimed to oversee implementation of the military aspects of the Dayton Peace Agreement, the accord ending the Bosnian War. Its main task was to guarantee the end of hostilities and separate the armed forces of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, on the one hand, and Republika Srpska, on the other. - IFOR in the field IFOR oversaw the transfer of territory between the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska, the demarcation of the inter-entity boundary and the removal of heavy weapons into approved cantonment sites.As the situation on the ground improved, IFOR began providing support to organisations involved in overseeing the implementation of the civilian aspects of the Dayton Peace Agreement, including the Office of the High Representative, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the United Nations. IFOR's goals were essentially completed by the September 1996 elections. As the situation was still potentially unstable and much remained to be accomplished on the civilian side, NATO agreed to deploy a new Stabilisation Force (SFOR) from December 1996. SFOR The Stabilisation Force (SFOR) operated under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, deriving its authority from UN Security Council Resolution 1088 of 12 December 1996. As was the case for IFOR, it was a peace enforcement operation that was more generally referred to as a peace support operation. - SFOR’s aim SFOR’s primary task was to contribute to a safe and secure environment conducive to civil and political reconstruction. Specifically, SFOR was tasked to deter or prevent a resumption of hostilities; to promote a climate in which the peace process could continue to move forward; and, to provide selective support within its means and capabilities to civilian organisations involved in this process. - SFOR in the field SFOR’s activities ranged from patrolling and providing area security through supporting defence reform and supervising de-mining operations, to arresting individuals indicted for war crimes and assisting the return of refugees and displaced people to their homes. Keeping the peace SFOR troops carried out regular patrols throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina to maintain a secure environment. Multinational specialised units were deployed to deal with instances of unrest. SFOR also collected and destroyed unregistered weapons and ordnance in private hands, in order to contribute to the overall safety of the population and to build confidence in the peace process. In 2003 alone, SFOR disposed of more than 11,000 weapons and 45,000 grenades. SFOR was also one of several organisations involved in de-mining in Bosnia and Herzegovina. NATO forces carried out some de-mining themselves and helped to set up de-mining schools in Banja Luka, Mostar and Travnik. They also helped to establish a sniffer dog training school in Bihac. Furthermore, SFOR had Multinational Specialised Units (MSU), which assisted the EU Police Mission (EUPM). The EUPM is responsible for helping the Bosnian authorities develop local police forces that meet the highest European and international standards, through monitoring, mentoring and inspecting police managerial and operational capacities. Reforming defence establishments A key aspect of SFOR's work in Bosnia and Herzegovina concerned reform of the country's defence structures, which had been divided into three rival ethnic groups at the end of hostilities. Within the framework of a Defence Reform Commission, both SFOR and NATO worked to help Bosnia and Herzegovina build a unified command and control structure and to develop joint doctrine and standards for training and equipment that are compatible with NATO and Partnership for Peace (PfP) norms. In March 2004, a state-level defence minister brought the country’s two separate armies under a single command structure. NATO's military headquarters in Sarajevo has a leadership role in the Defence Reform Commission and is continuing to work on defence reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Arresting war crimes suspects Although the apprehension of indicted war criminals was officially the responsibility of the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, NATO forces were instrumental in most arrests that have taken place. In total, SFOR brought 39 war crimes suspects to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague. SFOR also provided security and logistical support to ICTY investigative teams as well as surveillance of and ground patrolling around alleged mass graves. Contributing to reconstruction In addition to helping other organisations working on Bosnia and Herzegovina's reconstruction, SFOR launched its own Civil-Military Cooperation (CIMIC) projects in areas such as structural engineering and transportation. SFOR participated in the maintenance and repair of roads and railways in collaboration with the local authorities and other international agencies. This work has been critical to providing freedom of movement throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina. Command of the missions As for all NATO operations, political control and coordination are provided by the North Atlantic Council (NAC), NATO’s senior political decision-making body. Strategic command and control is exercised by NATO’s Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in Mons, Belgium. Command of IFOR Admiral Leighton Smith commanded IFOR (COMIFOR) from the start of the operation on 20 December 1995 until 31 July 1996. Admiral T. Joseph Lopez then took command until 7 November 1996, followed by General William Crouch from 7 November 1996 to 20 December 1996. The COMIFOR was based at operational headquarters in Zagreb, Croatia. Lieutenant General Michael Walker, Commander Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps (COMARRC) acted as Commander for IFOR's land component throughout the operation. Command of SFOR Following the hand-over to SFOR in December 1996, the command structure, as directed by the North Atlantic Council (NAC), was broadened to include a deputy SFOR commander, a deputy operational commander and divisional commanders at the head of each Multinational Task Force (MNTF) (1,800 - 2,000 troops). This structure comprised 300 staff at HQSFOR at Camp Butmir in Sarajevo, led by the Commander of SFOR (COMSFOR) and three MNTFs working in different areas: - MNTF-North (MNTF-N) based in Tuzla; - MNTF-Southeast (MNTF-SE) based in Mostar; and - MNTF-Northwest (MTNF-NW) based in Banja Luka. Restructuring of SFOR The NAC reviewed SFOR periodically at six monthly junctures to assess the force's effectiveness. On 25 October 1999, the NAC, based upon the improved security situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, reduced and restructured SFOR. Headquarters remained at Camp Butmir in Sarajevo but MNTFs were reduced in size from divisions to brigades. Each MNTF still retained individual brigade commanders. In addition, a Tactical Reserve Force of 1,000 battle-ready troops was created. As was the case with IFOR, every NATO member with armed forces committed troops to SFOR. Iceland, the only NATO country without armed forces, provided medical personnel. Non-NATO contributors at the time were: Albania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Sweden (which all became NATO members), Austria, Argentina, Ireland, Morocco and Russia; and by special arrangement with the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. All forces incorporated into SFOR came under the command of COMSFOR and the NAC. Commanders of SFOR – COMSFOR | | Gen. William Crouch, US A | 20 Dec 1996 - 30 Jul 1997 | | | Gen.

Schook, US A | 05 Oct 2004 - 02 Dec 2004 | The evolution of NATO’s assistance A four-year war started in Bosnia and Herzegovina when Yugoslavia – Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia (known at the time as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia), Serbia and Slovenia – broke up at the end of the Cold War. NATO's involvement in Bosnia and Herzegovina began in 1992. In June of that year, NATO foreign ministers stated that, on a case-by-case basis, the Alliance would support peacekeeping activities under the responsibility of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (subsequently renamed the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe). A month later, in July 1992, NATO began monitoring operations in the Adriatic in support of UNSCR 713 and 757 imposing an arms embargo and sanctions in the former Yugoslavia. By October 1992, NATO AWACS surveillance aircraft were monitoring operations in support of UNSCR 781, imposing a no-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina. And in November, NATO and the Western European Union began to enforce the sanctions and embargo imposed by UNSCR 787. By the end of the year, NATO declared that it stood ready to support peacekeeping operations under the authority of the United Nations. NATO's first ever military engagement After the United Nations authorised the enforcement of a no-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina, NATO began Operation Deny Flight in April 1993. On 28 February 1994, four warplanes violating the no-fly zone were shot down by NATO aircraft in the Alliance's first military engagement. At the request of the United Nations, NATO provided close air support to the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) on the ground and carried out air strikes to protect UN-designated safe havens. Air strikes were conducted against targets such as tanks, ammunition depots and air defence radars. NATO’s air operations against Bosnian Serb positions in August and September 1995 helped pave the way for a comprehensive peace agreement. The operation, Deliberate Force, lasted for 12 days and helped shift the balance of power between parties on the ground. It also helped persuade the Bosnian Serb leadership that the benefits of negotiating a peace agreement outweighed those of continuing to wage war. On 14 December 1995, after negotiations in Dayton, Ohio, the General Framework Agreement for Peace was signed in Paris, France. The Dayton Peace Agreement establishes Bosnia and Herzegovina as a single, democratic and multi-ethnic state with two entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska. And the first major crisis response operation IFOR was the Alliance's first major crisis response operation. It was set up to implement the military aspects of the Dayton Peace Agreement, when NATO took over responsibility for military operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina from UNPROFOR. IFOR’s goals were essentially completed by the September 1996 elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, as the situation was still potentially unstable and much remained to be accomplished on the civilian side, NATO agreed to deploy a new Stabilisation Force (SFOR) from December 1996. Mission hand-over to the European Union At their Istanbul Summit in June 2004, NATO leaders decided to bring SFOR to a conclusion by the end of the year as a result of the improved security situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the wider region. The SFOR mission was officially ended on 2 December 2004. In its place, a European Union-led force is deployed, known as Operation Althea. The Alliance is providing planning, logistic and command support for the EU mission, in the framework of a package of agreements known as ""Berlin Plus"". These agreements provide the overall framework for NATO-EU cooperation. NATO Headquarters Sarajevo The primary role of NATO Headquarters Sarajevo (NHQSa) is to advise and assist the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina in their development and commitments related to NATO programmes, defence and security sector reform, and closer integration with NATO. NHQSa also provides logistical and other forms of support to the European Union Force (EUFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the execution of its mission and tasks. Facts and figures Contributing countries Over the course of these missions, a total of 36 Allied and partner countries contributed troops. In addition, soldiers from five countries that were neither NATO members nor Partnership for Peace (PfP) countries participated at different times, namely Argentina, Australia, Chile, Malaysia and New Zealand. Troop numbers - IFOR IFOR was a 60,000-strong force that was deployed for one year. - SFOR SFOR originally comprised 31,000 troops. By early 2001, they had been reduced to 19,000 and, in spring 2002, the decision was taken to reduce troops to 12,000 by end 2002. By 2004, they totalled 7,000.",CREDIBLE

Comprehensive, good reporting does not only provide the full picture of truth about what is happening around us, but is also fighting polarisation and ‘news avoidance’ stemming from the constant flow of negative news which leads people to seek comfort in cooking shows and social media. Why constructive journalism? Studies show that mainstream media tend to focus on negative, sensationalist news, which is one of the main reasons why people avoid them. As a consequence, mainstream media have been losing audience and many people ended up getting news via social media and messaging apps. In addition, the traditional media approach “if it bleads it leads” proved to contribute to citizens disengagement and hopelessness. When practiced, constructive journalism proved to bring audiences back and have additional positive impact on societies. It is not a journalism that is painting a rosy picture. It is factual, critical and professional journalism, but it also focuses on what is good. It factually reflects who, what, when and why, as traditional journalism does, but it also askes “what now” and “what do we do about it”, providing a platform for discussion and facilitating solutions, instead of simply giving space for endless political fights that ultimately make people switch off. During the Western Balkans capacity building program, which took place in the first week of October 2023 in Aarhus and Copenhagen, the participants heard on this topic from the Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Ressa and deep dived into the principles of constructive journalism with leading figures of the Constructive Institute, as well as with some of the most influential practitioners of constructive journalism in the Danish media from TV2 Fyn, Norwegian Public Service Broadcaster/National TV NRK and Midtjyllands Avis. During the program, editors and journalists had a chance to discuss how constrictive journalism supports democracy as it informs citizens in a way that empowers them to understand complex issues. It makes them realise that the role of the decision- makers is not to endlessly fight among themselves, polarising people and societies, but to find solutions to the problems citizens face. The discussion also reflected how the constructive journalism approach gives citizens a sense of agency and a motive to participate in democratic processes. Within this program, the participants also visited the Danish Parliament, Christiansborg and had deliberations on the EU accession of the Western Balkans, fight against FIMI and visited the European Environment Agency (EEA) where they had a thorough briefing on the EU environmental policies and projects which the EU is implementing in the region. The topic of constructive journalism is prominently featured in our new social media campaign Europeans in Action, where lessons from Denmark are distilled and elaborated upon in short videos, alongside other pertinent topics such as media literacy and media transparency. This is what our Europeans in Action have to say: ”. Background The EEAS Western Balkans StratCom Task Force implemented this program within its efforts to keep building resilience to Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) in the Western Balkans. This programme was implemented in cooperation with the Constructive Institute, an independent centre based in Aarhus University in Denmark, which support journalists and news organisations for a “reporting that is more solutions-focused, balanced and connects society”.

The Belarusian Defence Ministry alleged that Ukraine was building up its forces on Saturday. A spokesman for Ukraine’s border guard service said on Monday that such statements were part of a Russian-supported “information operation” and that Kyiv kept forces near the border with Belarus to prevent any “provocations”. When asked about the Belarusian build-up claim, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov reminded reporters on Monday that Belarus was part of a union state with Russia and that dialogue between Moscow and Minsk, including between their intelligence agencies, was close. “And our ministries of defence are in constant contact with each other. Of course, this is a cause for concern, not only for Minsk, but also for Moscow, because we are indeed allies and partners.” Peskov said Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko would both attend a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation which is taking place in Kazakhstan on July 3-4 and would discuss the matter if they deemed it necessary. Belarus, a close Russian ally that has provided support for what Moscow calls its special military operation in Ukraine, said last week that it was reinforcing its border with Ukraine after a security incident and had deployed a division of multiple launch rocket systems to test their combat readiness. The Belarusian border guard service said its forces had brought down a quadrocopter on Wednesday after it had illegally crossed the border from Ukraine to collect information about Belarusian border infrastructure. Earlier last week, the border service said materials for a homemade bomb had been found concealed in the same area and that it was aware that a unit of pro-Ukrainian Russian fighters was present in a Ukrainian region bordering Belarus.",CREDIBLE

Russian authorities have continued to increase the systematic internal repression by cracking down on opposition politicians, civil society organisations, independent media and other critical voices with the use of repressive legislation and politically motivated prison sentences. The shocking death of opposition politician Alexei Navalny in the run-up to the elections is yet another sign of the accelerating and systematic repression. The elections took place in an ever-shrinking political space, which has resulted in an alarming increase of violations of civil and political rights, and precluded many candidates from running, including all those opposed to Russia’s illegal war of aggression, deprived Russian voters of a real choice and heavily limited their access to accurate information. The European Union will continue to support the important work of Russian civil society organisations, human rights defenders and independent media. The European Union regrets the decision of Russian authorities not to invite OSCE/ODIHR observers to its elections. This runs contrary to Russia’s OSCE commitments and has denied Russia’s voters and institutions an impartial and independent assessment of these elections. Furthermore, the European Union strongly condemns the illegal holding of so-called “elections” in the territories of Ukraine that Russia has temporarily occupied: Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol, as well as in parts of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. The so-called “elections” in these territories represent yet another manifest violation by Russia of international law, including the UN Charter, and of Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. Referring to the two UNGA Resolutions of 12 October 2022 and 27 March 2014, we urge Russia to respect Ukraine’s internationally recognised borders and sovereignty. The European Union reiterates that it does not and will never recognise either the holding of these so-called “elections” in the territories of Ukraine or their results. They are null and void and cannot produce any legal effect whatsoever. Russia’s political leadership and those involved in organising them will face consequences of these illegal actions. The European Union reiterates its unwavering support for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders. Russia must cease its illegal war of aggression against Ukraine and immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw its military forces and equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine. The candidate countries North Macedonia, Montenegro, Albania, Ukraine, Republic of Moldova and Bosnia and Herzegovina*, as well as the EFTA countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, members of the European Economic Area, align themselves with this statement. * North Macedonia, Montenegro, Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina continue to be part of the Stabilisation and Association Process.

AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. Ukraine’s Security Service wrote in a statement on Telegram that it found wreckage from a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile at the hospital and has opened proceedings on war crime charges. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed without evidence in a Telegram post that images from Kyiv showed the damage was caused by a Ukrainian air defense missile. As supposed proof of Ukraine’s responsibility, social media users shared old photos, falsely claiming they showed shrapnel from such missiles that was found at the hospital following Monday’s attack. THE FACTS: After Ukraine’s largest children’s hospital was struck as part of a daytime barrage that saw dozens of Russian missiles target five Ukrainian cities, posts circulated social media falsely claiming that Ukraine was at fault for the hit. “Ukraine blew up their own children’s hospital in Kiev this morning with an American air defense missile,” reads one X post that had received approximately 9,200 likes and more than 4,300 shares as of Monday. “Stop sending these TERRORISTS BOMBS @POTUS.” Another post on X that had been liked and shared more than 5,500 times states: “Ukrainian children’s hospital was hit by a Ukrainian anti air defense missile. Ukraine shoots up to 3 air defense rockets per Russian cruise missile, all can’t hit the Russian missile…so they land randomly in the city.” But Ukraine’s Security Service wrote on Telegram that it found wreckage from a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile at the site — including fragments of the rear hull with a serial number and a rudder — and opened proceedings on war crimes. The Kh-101 is an air-launched missile that flies low to avoid detection by radar. Ukraine said it shot down 11 of 13 Kh-101 missiles launched Monday, The Associated Press has reported. The International Criminal Court’s founding charter says it is a war crime to intentionally attack “hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are collected, provided they are not military objectives.” Russia’s Defense Ministry, also on Telegram, said the strikes targeted Ukrainian defense plants and military air bases and were successful. It denied aiming at any civilian facilities and claimed without evidence that pictures from Kyiv indicated the damage at the hospital was caused by a Ukrainian air defense missile. Since early in the Russia-Ukraine war that is well into its third year, Russian officials have regularly claimed that Moscow’s forces never attack civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, despite abundant evidence to the contrary, including AP reporting. Some posts are sharing photos they claim show shrapnel from Ukrainian air defense missiles found at the hospital as supposed evidence that Ukraine is at fault for the attack. One image has been online since at least 2022 and another since at least May. Two other photos were originally posted on Telegram by a Ukrainian media outlet with the caption, “Debris from rockets is found in Kyiv after a massive rocket attack.” The post, written in Ukrainian, does not specify what kind of rockets the debris is from or where in Kyiv it was found. At least 31 people were killed and more than 150 wounded in Monday’s missile barrage, the AP has reported. It was Russia’s heaviest bombardment of Kyiv in almost four months, hitting seven of the city’s 10 districts. Seven people were killed in the capital, including two staff members at the hospital, where three children were hurt. Strikes in Kryvyi Rih, Zelenskyy’s birthplace in central Ukraine, killed 10. The attack unfolded a day before Western leaders who have backed Ukraine were scheduled to begin a three-day NATO summit in Washington to consider how they can reassure Kyiv of the alliance’s unwavering support and offer Ukrainians hope that their country can survive Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II. ___ This is part of the AP’s effort to address widely shared false and misleading information that is circulating online.

The fall of France altered the situation. On the day that Paris fell, June 15, 1940, Joseph Stalin presented an ultimatum to Lithuania to admit an unlimited number of troops and to form a government acceptable to the U.S.S.R. Lithuania was occupied that day. President Smetona fled to Germany, and a “people’s government” was installed. In the next two days, similar ultimatums were presented to Latvia and Estonia, both of which experienced similar fates. Sovietization moved at a rapid pace, taking little, if any, consideration of the constitutions in force in the three countries. The outlawed communist parties, whose memberships were extremely small, emerged as the leading political force. On July 14–15 the new Soviet regimes organized elections to people’s assemblies in which only a single slate of candidates appeared. The new assemblies immediately voted, by acclamation, to request incorporation of their countries into the U.S.S.R. In early August 1940 these requests were “accepted” by the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. National and social life was quickly restructured to fit into a Soviet mold. Property was extensively nationalized. Initially professional and educated circles were principally affected. Within a year the targets had become indiscriminate. Beginning on the night of June 13–14, 1941, mass deportations, including women and children, to Arctic or desert regions of the U.S.S.R. were carried out. Estonia lost about 60,000 people, while Latvia and Lithuania lost about 35,000 each. The deportations were still under way when Germany attacked the U.S.S.R. on June 22, 1941. German occupation The Balts considered the Germans liberators. A revolt broke out in Lithuania on the first day of the war, and a provisional government was established. Somewhat later, as the German armies approached Riga and Tallinn, attempts to reestablish national governments were made. It was hoped that the Germans would reestablish Baltic independence, making the resurrected states allies. Such political hopes, as well as expectations of the return of expropriated property, soon evaporated. Germany turned the Baltic states and Belorussia (now Belarus) into a new territorial unit, Ostland, for which outright Germanization and eventual incorporation into the Reich was envisaged. Baltic cooperation became less forthright or ceased altogether. Indigenous but virtually powerless local administrations were set up in each of the Baltic countries. Their principal task, apart from day-to-day administration, was to funnel Baltic resources into the German war effort. Attempts to attract volunteers for various German-sponsored military or paramilitary units proved only partially successful. In all three countries several armed police battalions composed of volunteers were organized to provide military support away from their homelands. Waffen-SS—that is, frontline divisions serving on the Eastern Front—were also organized. Estonia contributed one such unit and Latvia two. In 1944 a Lithuanian home defense unit was organized, but dislocations and German failure to honour promises to the organizers about its functions led to its effective disbandment. In total disregard of international conventions, the German administration declared a compulsory draft into the Reich labour service. Efforts to conscript such labour did not meet expected results. Anti-German opposition crystallized in the Baltic countries. Procommunist and nationalist guerrilla movements existed throughout the war. Three thousand Estonians fled to Finland and joined the Finnish armed forces in their war against the U.S.S.R. In Latvia an underground nationalist Central Council of Latvia was formed on August 13, 1943. An analogous body, the Supreme Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania, emerged on November 25, 1943, and on March 23, 1944, the underground National Committee of the Estonian Republic was founded. The three maintained contact with each other and with the outside world through Finland and Sweden. Each suffered heavily from German repression in the spring and summer of 1944. During the fall of 1944, most of the region reverted to Soviet control. The Germans held out in western Lithuania until early 1945 and in Courland until the capitulation of May 8, 1945. Wartime losses in the Baltic states were among the highest in Europe. Estimates of wartime population loss stand at 25 percent for Estonia, 30 percent for Latvia, and 15 percent for Lithuania. These include the Soviet deportations in 1941, the German deportation and extermination of the Jewish population, and the sizable flight to Sweden and Germany in 1944–45. War and occupation deaths have been estimated at 90,000 in Estonia, 180,000 in Latvia, and 250,000 in Lithuania. Soviet republics Postwar political, industrial, and agricultural policies wrought fundamental changes in the economic and social structures of the Baltic lands. Their economies were integrated into the general Soviet system of planning and development. Considerable increases in production resulted from heavy investment in large projects in Estonia and Latvia. Industrialization and urbanization in less-developed Lithuania began during the late 1950s. Living standards remained generally low by European measures but were higher than average in comparison with the U.S.S.R. as a whole. After regaining control the Soviets resumed the integration of the Baltic lands into the U.S.S.R. The political structures that had been fashioned in 1940–41 were reestablished. A considerable number of nonindigenous officials, unfamiliar with the societies of the region, were brought in to consolidate Soviet rule and to complement the heavy presence of military and coercive forces. The regime sought to eradicate the last vestiges of the period of independence. The independent farming class that had provided the political base of the independence period was especially targeted. Opposition proved particularly pronounced and dramatic in rural areas, especially in Lithuania, then still an overwhelmingly agrarian society. National guerrilla opposition developed by late 1944 and lasted into the early 1950s. It proved especially acute during two waves in 1948–49 of forced collectivization accompanied by mass deportations. It has been estimated that between 1946 and 1953 deportations and guerrilla deaths reached 95,000 in Estonia, 125,000 in Latvia, and 310,000 in Lithuania. After 1953 many of the surviving deportees were allowed to return, though in many cases not to their former homes. Postwar socioeconomic policies transformed all three countries from predominantly rural societies into largely urbanized countries. In 1939 Estonia had been 66 percent rural; Latvia, 65 percent; and Lithuania, 77 percent. Fifty years later these figures were reversed: Estonia was 72 percent urban; Latvia, 71 percent; and Lithuania, 67 percent. The three Baltic republics were the most urbanized portion of the U.S.S.R. Urbanization, a declining birth rate, and massive immigration of non-Balts, particularly into the major cities of Estonia and Latvia, significantly altered the ethnic composition of the population. At the end of the century, Estonia was about two-thirds Estonian and Latvia slightly more than one-half Latvian. The percentage of native peoples in the populations of the major cities was even smaller. Lithuania, less urbanized and maintaining a higher birth rate, was less affected by immigration, with a native population of about four-fifths. Immigration also affected the social composition of the population. While the bulk of immigrants were industrial workers, a significant white-collar element also arrived. Russians and other Soviet immigrants manned large military concentrations in the region. They were disproportionately represented in the ruling structure of the regime, the Communist Party apparatus, and political and economic administrative posts. Many of the larger enterprises were directly administered from Moscow. The immigrant element generally saw little need to learn the local language or to identify with the native population. During the Thaw, a general liberalization of Soviet life in the late 1950s and early 1960s, an attempt was made in Latvia to reverse this trend and to nativize the political and administrative elite. The move backfired and triggered a purge of native elements in the ruling apparatus. As a result, Latvia became more Russified than its two neighbours. The regime sought to integrate education and cultural life into a multinational Soviet ideological mold but was not entirely successful in this effort. From the late 1950s on, national cultural life did generally manage to transcend various artificial ideological impositions and to emerge as the principal arena of national consciousness and self-identity. Religious life acquired a similar role. This was especially true in Lithuania, where the Roman Catholic church became a bulwark of national resistance. By the 1970s the Baltic area had emerged as a hotbed of anti-Soviet dissent. Riots and unsanctioned antiregime demonstrations occurred on several occasions. Unofficial typewritten publications were produced and circulated clandestinely. The most notable periodical of this type, The Chronicle of the Lithuanian Catholic Church, appeared from 1972 until the collapse of the Soviet system in the late 1980s. Reestablishment of independence The attempts to reform the system during the second half of the 1980s under the guidance of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev created a new situation in the Baltic lands. The weakening of the central power structure in Moscow allowed an assertion of increasing autonomy in the constituent republics of the U.S.S.R. The process was especially pronounced in the three Baltic republics, whose indigenous populations had never reconciled themselves to the loss of independence. Moreover, the incorporation of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania into the U.S.S.R. had never been recognized de jure by the United States or virtually any other Western country. The remaining prewar legations and consulates in the West underscored the unsettled situation. In 1988 mass movements for change emerged in each of the Baltic republics: the Popular Front of Estonia, the Popular Front of Latvia, and the Lithuanian Movement for Reconstruction (Sa̡jūdis). In 1989 their elected representatives at the Congress of People’s Deputies in Moscow formally raised the question of the illegality of the incorporation of the Baltic states into the U.S.S.R. On August 23, 1989, a massive demonstration involving some 500,000 people—a human chain linking Tallinn in Estonia, Riga in Latvia, and Vilnius in Lithuania—dramatized the 50th anniversary of the German-Soviet pact of 1939, whose secret provisions had led to the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states. Elections in early 1990 resulted in pro-independence majorities in all three Baltic legislatures. Meeting on March 11, 1990, the first freely elected parliament in postwar Lithuania declared the reestablishment of an independent state. Estonia followed later in the month and Latvia in May. The declarations were pronounced illegal by Moscow, which set up an economic blockade of Lithuania, restricting deliveries of oil and gas. A series of other moves designed to reinstate pro-Soviet governments and to undercut the Baltic resolve for independence followed. These culminated in bloodshed on January 13, 1991, during the Soviet military occupation of the Vilnius television tower. A few days later a bloody incident occurred in Riga. Sporadic outbreaks of violence continued throughout the spring and summer. The abortive coup in Moscow in August 1991 by hard-line elements aimed at curtailing Gorbachev’s restructuring of the U.S.S.R. facilitated the implementation of Baltic independence. In early September most countries of the world recognized the sovereignty of the Baltic states. During the same month, they were admitted into the United Nations. The U.S.S.R. itself acknowledged the illegality of their incorporation in 1940 and recognized their reemergence as independent states. The subsequent decade saw the development of new constitutions, new currencies, and new foreign markets for each of the Baltic states. The immediate post-Soviet period, however, was marked by economic instability, and in 1998 a financial crisis in Russia had repercussions throughout the region. Nevertheless, at the beginning of the 21st century, the Baltic states experienced sustained economic growth and closer integration with the nations of the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization—two groups that all three countries joined in 2004.",CREDIBLE

With more than five years of experience monitoring the situation in Ukraine, as well as Russia’s use of propaganda and disinformation to undermine the US, NATO, and the European Union, DFRLab’s global team presents the latest installment of the Russian War Report. Tracking narratives Kremlin claims Bucha massacre was staged by Ukraine Pro-Kremlin accounts denying Bucha ‘massacre’ dominate VKontakte conversations Kremlin attempts to reboot pro-war symbols online and offline Russian soldiers allegedly sent stolen goods from Ukraine to Russia Security Russian troops abandon Hostomel Airport, leaving destruction behind Signs of Russian forces preparing to re-deploy from Belarus Cyber warfare Roskomnadzor warns of spearphishing attacks using agency’s identity Kremlin claims Bucha massacre was staged by Ukraine Over the weekend of April 2, journalists and Ukrainian authorities reported on dozens of dead civilians found in Bucha, northwest of Kyiv, after Russian troops left the area. Images captured by multiple sources documented how some of the dead had their hands tied. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of committing genocide in Ukraine, while Charles Michel, president of the European Council, used the hashtag #BuchaMassacre when he announced the EU was preparing further sanctions against Russia. Despite the overwhelming evidence of mass civilian casualties in Bucha, the Kremlin is trying to cover up the killings through false claims and distortion. On April 3, Russia’s Ministry of Defense shared a post from the pro-Kremlin War on Fakes Telegram channel that called the massacre a “coordinated media campaign.” The post claimed that Russian forces left Bucha on March 30, and footage of the dead only appeared four days later as a result of shelling by Ukraine. The Telegram post also included a graphic video that it claimed was proof that bodies had been placed in the streets to generate public outrage, and that some of the bodies were actually actors pretending to be dead. A few hours later, the Ministry of Defense posted an official statement claiming that “not a single local resident has suffered from any violent action” during the Russian occupation of the city. It reiterated the narrative that footage of dead civilians only emerged four days after Russian troops left the city, and asserted that locals had been allowed to leave beforehand. The statement also claimed that the bodies did not show any signs of stiffening or decomposition. It concluded that the scenes in Bucha had been staged by “the Ukrainian regime” for Western media, and that Ukraine had done the same in Mariupol and other cities. The Twitter account for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs disseminated a summary of the Defense Ministry statement and called that the Bucha massacre “another hoax by the Kyiv regime for the Western media.” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed that Ukraine staged the massacre to scuttle peace negotiations and escalate the conflict. Russia then demanded a meeting of the UN Security Council to be convened on April 4 to discuss the events in Bucha. Notably, Kremlin media’s own reporting undermines the narrative that Russian troops had departed Bucha four days before the bodies were documented. On April 1, Zvezda TV reported that Russian Marines were still conducting “clean-up” operations in Bucha and other cities to regain a foothold in the region. That same day, the Kyiv Oblast administration still included Bucha in its list of the most dangerous areas due to Russian forces retreating from there. These reports seemed to align with a Kyiv military administration statement the previous day, which reported that Bucha was still under the control of Russian armed forces. All of this suggests that Russia’s claims of having evacuated the city on March 30 are false. Additionally, April 3 was not the first day that reports of civilian deaths surfaced, as the Kremlin suggested. On April 1, graphic footage from Bucha appeared on the Irpin Bucha Gostomel Telegram channel (“Ирпень | Буча | Гостомель”) in which a car is seen driving around corpses on the same street featured in the War on Fakes Telegram channel video. One of the corpses seen in the April 1 video matches a body in the April 3 War on Fakes video, despite the fact that the Telegram channel claimed the body in question was moving. On April 2, AFP reported that bodies of at least 20 men in civilian clothes had been found on a single street in Bucha. The Ukrainian fact-checking outlet StopFake also cited a graphic YouTube video filmed on April 2 by Ukrainian journalist Dmitry Komarov documenting civilian deaths in the city. As for the War on Fakes Telegram post showing footage it claimed proved the bodies were actually actors, Russian independent outlet Mediazona analyzed the video and concluded that the “movement of a corpse’s hand” alleged in the original post was actually a visual distortion caused by a drop of water or a scratch on the windshield of the car from where video was filmed. Mediazona also debunked the War on Fakes Telegram claim that one of the alleged corpses was attempting to stand up, concluding that the “movement” seen in the footage was due to distortion from capturing the footage through the car’s rear-view mirror. —Givi Gigitashvili, Research Associate, Warsaw, Poland Pro-Kremlin accounts denying Bucha massacre dominate VKontakte conversations Pro-Kremlin accounts dominated conversations about the Bucha massacre on the Russian social media platform VKontakte (VK), denying and deflecting any Russian responsibility. Ekaterina Gubareva, a former politician in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic and the wife of Donetsk separatist leader Pavel Gubarev, wrote on VK that the Russian soldiers in Bucha treated the local population “with love.” The post received more than 25,000 views. Reuters reported that civilians in Bucha were told by the Russian forces to use white armbands to identify themselves. However, Russian soldiers have also previously worn white armbands. Ukrainian military sources have reported that the Russians are deliberately marking civilians with white armbands to confuse Ukrainian forces. Gubareva suggested that any dead civilians wearing white armbands were killed by the Ukrainian military, who she claimed shot at civilians while liberating the city. In addition, Denis Tukmakov, a pro-Kremlin columnist, and Igor Levitas, an author at the pro-Kremlin EADaily, stated that the Bucha killings were staged. Tumakov claimed that the bodies were not stiff and that Russian commanders would not leave the bodies behind. In his post, Tumakov listed atrocities that the West has accused Russia of committing and concluded that there would be no more peace talks. “So Russia has no other option but to win,” he wrote. “Otherwise, we will not just lose – we will be turned into Hitler.” Other VK posts that received less attention expressed shock, but did not condemn Russia. For example, Nikolay Rybakov, a member of the liberal Russian party Yabloko, wrote, “I am shocked by the horrifying photographs of murdered civilians from the city of Bucha, Kiev region.” Similarly, a pro-Alexei Navalny user, Vadim Orlov, posted an image with a crying statue and wrote: “Bucha. F*cked up. I saw it.” In contrast, Russian writer Dmitry Glukhovsky re-posted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s speech addressing Russians and condemning the Russian military’s atrocities in the Kyiv suburbs. The post received more than 22,000 views. —Nika Aleksejeva, Lead Researcher, Riga, Latvia Kremlin attempts to reboot pro-war symbols online and offline On March 30, Kremlin-owned outlet RT reported on the popularization of pro-war symbols in Russia. According to RT, Russian entrepreneurs became interested in branding their products with the letters V and Z, which are now considered “patriotic symbols” in the country. The letter Z has become almost ubiquitous among Kremlin media, officials, and supporters rallying support for the war in Ukraine, as well as a tool for spreading propaganda. RT reported that since the start of Russia’s “special operation” in Ukraine, the Russian patent and trademark office has received “dozens of applications for the registration of various trademarks using the symbols V and Z.” Russian entrepreneurs are rushing to register their right to use pro-war symbols exclusively on various products, ostensibly because trademark pirates might want to hijack the symbols. RT also reported on requests to register pro-war hashtags, including #своихнебросаем (“we don’t leave ours [behind]”), #мненестыдно (“I am not ashamed”), and #ярусский (“I am Russian”). The combination of the letter Z and the “I am not ashamed” hashtag has already appeared on t-shirts of pro-war campaigners. The DFRLab previously reported on the failed attempts to popularize the “I am not ashamed” hashtag on Twitter and Facebook. Examination of #МнеНеСтыдно showed that engagement with the hashtag on social media was minor and decreased dramatically in the period of February 26 to March 2. Further analysis of the hashtag over the last month shows that engagement remains very low. Russia’s attempts to block Western social networks might explain some of the limited engagement. However, a recent report analyzing blocked social media outlets published by the pro-Kremlin online outlet RBC.ru showed that millions of Russians are still using Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, likely through the use of VPNs. —Eto Buziashvili, Research Associate, Washington DC Russian soldiers allegedly sent stolen goods from Ukraine to Russia The Security Service of Ukraine published what it claimed were numerous intercepted phone calls between Russian soldiers and their relatives in Russia in which they boast about looting and theft. Evidence of Russian looting has previously emerged, such as when Ukrainian troops captured a Russian infantry fighting vehicle containing an assortment of items, including a toy car, frying pan, and Ukrainian coupons that had not been in use since the 1990s. Previously, the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense reported that Russian soldiers received instructions to establish self-sufficiency until further notice, essentially condoning looting to make up for Russia’s logistical problems. The most substantial evidence of Russian looting emerged on April 3, when the Belarusian Telegram channel Belaruski Gayun published a three-hour-long CCTV video from the Mozyr branch of CDEK, a Russian delivery company. In the video, Russian troops with the 56th Guards Air Assault Brigade are seen mailing stolen goods to an unconfirmed location. The destination is likely Russia, however, as the receiver’s phone number and last name are briefly seen in the video. Among the stolen goods captured in the CCTV footage are a video card, an e-scooter, liquor, four air conditioners, car batteries, and dry rations from the Russian Army. Some of the goods were wrapped in packaging from the Ukrainian supermarket chain Epicentr. —Roman Osadchuk, Research Associate Russian troops abandon Hostomel Airport, leaving destruction behind On March 31, local and government reports first indicated that Russian troops were repositioning from the outskirts of Kyiv. As Ukrainian troops regained control of the area, footage emerged showing the extent of the damage at Hostomel Airport, which Russian troops maintained control of after an intense battle from February 24 to 26. On April 1, CNN released photos confirming the Russians’ departure from the airport. Footage taken by Ukrainians on the ground show the airfield is clear of hostilities. On March 31, Babylon’13, a Ukrainian documentary group, released drone footage of the airport. The footage captured demolished buildings, discarded military vehicles, and numerous planes in ruins, including the An-225 Mriya, the world’s largest aircraft. The video showed no sign of Russian troops. By April 1, photos and videos began appearing on Telegram that appeared to be taken by Ukrainians on the ground in Hostomel. One post showed an image of the destroyed An-225 Mriya. Another video posted on Twitter showed multiple destroyed Russian BMDs located in the airport parking lot, which the DFRLab geolocated to Avtodorozhnia Street, along the edge of the airfield. Although more images and videos continue to emerge from around Hostomel, it is still unclear if the Russian military is truly abandoning its war aims in the outskirts of Kyiv, or if this merely an attempt to regroup. —Ingrid Dickinson, Young Global Professional, Washington DC Signs of Russian forces preparing to re-deploy from Belarus New footage surfaced on social media showing growing numbers of Russian troops in Gomel, Belarus. An increasing numbers of social media posts documented large Russian military formation movements in the city, likely moving towards the train station for re-deployment. Some videos show Russian VDV airborne troops rolling through Gomel, which the DFRLab geolocated to Bahdan Chmialnicki Street. Additional videos that surfaced on April 4 show military equipment being loaded on trains. These videos were geolocated and verified to be in the southern railway station in Gomel. Other footage showed destroyed Russian equipment already on trains departing in an unknown direction. These logistical movements are thought to be preparation for increased operations in the Donbas region. On April 4, the head of the Luhansk regional military administration said that Ukrainians are seeing that “Russian accumulation is very, very powerful in the vicinity.” According to the Pentagon, troops from Belarus are likely to be redeployed in the southern front as well. —Lukas Andriukaitis, Associate Director, Brussels, Belgium Roskomnadzor warns of spearphishing attacks using agency’s identity On April 1, Russian censor Roskomnadzor issued an unusual alert about fraudulent emails sent under its name. It warned that such emails could be used for spearphishing attacks. Roskomnadzor did not mention a specific security incident that precipitated the press release, nor have any such incidents been reported in the Russian media. Roskomnadzor has risen to international prominence through its frequent condemnations of Western social media companies and increasingly aggressive censorship of Russian civil society. This higher profile has also made the agency a target. On March 10, Distributed Denial of Secrets, a “transparency collective,” released 360,000 hacked files from Roskomnadzor. These files, totaling 526.9 GB, provided significant insight into the agency’s technical and legal processes as well as its administrative structure. The source of the hack claimed to be associated with Anonymous. The compromise of Roskomnadzor’s internal data and emails, coupled with its unprecedented enforcement actions and public visibility, have created a perfect storm for spearphishing attacks co-opting the agency’s identity to target Russian individuals and media organizations. —Emerson T.

Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics. An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

The U.S. warning to Russia ahead of a terrorist attack near Moscow was highly specific: Crocus City Hall was a potential target of the Islamic State, according to U.S. officials. The warning had the right venue but imprecise timing, suggesting that the attack could come within days. Indeed, the public warning by the United States Embassy on March 7 warned of potential terrorist attacks in the next two days. Gunmen stormed the hall on March 22, killing 144 people, the deadliest attack in Russia in nearly 20 years. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, and Russia charged four men from Tajikistan, accusing them of carrying out the massacre. Julian E.

""In November, I visited the Holodomor memorial in Kyiv. It was a heartbreaking reminder of a terrible crime,"" the minister wrote. ""Today, Althingi (the parliament) recognized the man-made famine of the winter of 1932–1933 as genocide perpetrated by the totalitarian government in Moscow against the people of Ukraine."" President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the decision, adding, ""It is a clear signal that such crimes do not go unpunished and do not have a statute of limitations."" The Holodomor, a man-made famine that took place between 1932-33, occurred during Joseph Stalin's reign over the Soviet Union and caused an estimated 3.5 to 5 million Ukrainian deaths. The Ukrainian government has been calling on the international community to recognize it as a genocide. Iceland joined Belgium, which recognized the Holodomor as a genocide on March 10. The Czech Republic did so in April 2022, Germany, Romania, and Ireland in November 2022, and Bulgaria in February 2023.

https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/sl-ukrainians-behave-like-nazis-in-kursk-region/,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/18/europe/zelensky-kursk-incursion-second-bridge-intl/index.html,2024-08-18,"Ukraine’s military incursion into Kursk aims to create a “buffer zone” to prevent cross-border attacks by Moscow’s forces, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed Sunday, as his troops blew up a second bridge in the Russian border region. Ukrainian forces are inching forward in Kursk amid fighting following the launch of their surprise military operation there nearly two weeks ago. But Ukraine also remains under pressure in its occupied east as Russian forces advance toward a key military hub. The Kursk offensive has left Russia struggling to shore up its own territory. Kyiv seems to have multiple goals with the assault, from boosting morale after a torrid few months to stretching Russia’s resources. A Ukrainian presidential aide said the incursion aimed at ensuring a “fair” negotiation process. For the first time, Zelensky on Sunday stated the strategic ambitions of the operation, saying, “It is now our primary task in defensive operations overall: to destroy as much Russian war potential as possible and conduct maximum counteroffensive actions.” Those include “creating a buffer zone on the aggressor’s territory,” the president said in his latest address. “Everything that inflicts losses on the Russian army, Russian state, their military-industrial complex, and their economy helps prevent the war from expanding and brings us closer to a just end to this aggression,” Zelensky said. Speaking on Monday, Zelensky also suggested the incursion could give Ukraine leverage in securing the release of prisoners of war. During a meeting to discuss Ukraine’s incursion, acting Kursk governor Alexei Smirnov told Russian President Vladimir Putin that Kyiv’s forces had penetrated 12 kilometers (about 7.5 miles) inside Russia and now control 28 settlements within the Kursk region. More than 121,000 Kursk residents have been evacuated, Russia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations wrote Monday on Telegram, with more than 650 people leaving the region in the past 24 hours. Despite the shock of Kyiv’s incursion, Russia has continued to advance in eastern Ukraine and is closing in on the city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk region, where authorities are scrambling to evacuate tens of thousands of residents. Kyiv’s foothold in Kursk is “getting stronger” with troops reinforcing their positions, according to Zelensky. Kyiv says it controls nearly 1,000 square kilometers (about 621 square miles) of Russian territory, and both Russia and Ukraine have urged residents to evacuate from areas where heavy fighting is ongoing. As part of efforts to cripple Moscow’s logistical capabilities and disrupt supply routes, Ukrainian forces said Sunday they blew up another bridge over the Seym river in the Kursk region, with “precision airstrikes.” “The Air Force aviation continues to deprive the enemy of logistics capabilities with precision airstrikes, which significantly affects the course of combat operations,” Ukrainian Air Force commander Lt. Gen. Mykola Oleshchuk said in a social media post that included a video showing plumes of smoke engulfing parts of the bridge. The attack comes two days after Ukrainian forces destroyed a first bridge over the Seym. Russia’s foreign ministry said Ukraine had used Western rockets to carry out that attack, which were likely US-made HIMARS. HIMARS, or the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, has perhaps been the most revered and feared piece of weaponry in Kyiv’s fight and since arriving has helped Ukraine to take back significant swaths of territory from Russia. The Ukrainian monitoring group DeepState said Sunday that Kyiv is making further gains in Kursk and shared a still image from a video, also geolocated by CNN, of what it said was a Ukrainian Defense Forces tank in the village of Olgovka, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of the town of Sudzha. Kyiv’s forces took control of Sudzha last week and established a military commandant’s office there, according to Ukrainian military officials. On Sunday, Ukrainian armed forces published a video of what they said were “Sivalka” flamethrower systems “engaged in active combat operations” in the Kursk direction. Russia appears to have diverted several thousand troops from frontline fighting in occupied Ukraine to address the territorial loss in Kursk. And residents who fled the area due to the fighting have been warned not to go back. “The operational situation on the territory of our district remains complicated. Some citizens are not giving up their attempts to return home, thus hindering the work of our military,” said the head of Kursk’s Korenevsky district, Marina Degtyareva, on Sunday. “Returning to the area so far is impossible for local residents, and sometimes results in terrible tragedies.” Authorities would tell residents when it is safe to return, she added. “I appeal to all residents of Korenevsky district, let’s be patient and let our military deal with the enemy, let’s not interfere with our defenders,” she said. Russians reach outskirts of key city Despite Kyiv’s push further into Kursk, Russian forces are also advancing in eastern Ukraine. Russia’s army has moved closer to the city of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, which serves as a key hub for the Ukrainian military because of its easy access to the town of Kostiantynivka, another military center. Ukraine uses the road connecting the two to resupply the front lines and evacuate casualties. Vadym Filashkin, head of the Donetsk military administration, said Monday that officials in Pokrovsk have started the “forced evacuation” of children and their parents as Russian troops close in on the city. More than 53,000 people remain in Pokrovsk, including 4,000 children, according to local officials. Serhii Dobriak, head of the Pokrovsk city military administration, warned earlier that residents have “1-2 weeks to leave, no more.” “The Russians are close, up to 11 kilometers (7 miles) from the outskirts of the town. The town is getting ready,” Dobriak said on Sunday. “Every town in Donetsk region has a combat unit assigned to it, and defense plans have been developed. We are working with the military to build fortifications. This is a continuous process.” Zelensky said Sunday that Ukrainian units “are doing everything to hold the positions” amid dozens of attacks on the front lines in Donetsk. The evacuation of civilians from Pokrovsk has been accelerated because of the approach of Russian troops. Nearly 1,800 people have been evacuated from the city over the past week alone; until recently 450-500 residents were being evacuated every month. “The Russians are destroying our towns and villages, killing civilians, so we need to think about our safety and evacuate,” Dobriak said. “Currently, the town is being hit by missiles, MLRS, and there have been several guided aerial bomb attacks.” Ukraine’s Vice Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk on Sunday urged residents of Pokrovsk and other settlements “in the immediate vicinity of the front line” to evacuate and “leave for safer regions.” Vereshchuk said she understood residents would have to leave their jobs, homes and property, but “nevertheless, the lives and health of you and your children are more valuable,” and staying in the area would interfere with the work of the defense forces. Intense fighting is also underway around the villages of Pivnichne and Zalizne in Donetsk, about 64 kilometers (40 miles) east of Pokrovsk, where Russian forces launched “a massive assault” Sunday morning, Ukraine’s General Staff said. “The Russian invaders, supported by an armored group of 12 vehicles, attempted to break through the Ukrainian military positions and advance toward Toretsk,” the General Staff said, referring to another strategic town that could open the way for Russian forces to advance toward Kostiantynivka, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. Over the past week, Russia used more than 40 missiles, 750 guided aerial bombs and 200 attack drones against Ukrainian cities and villages, Zelensky said Sunday. “For such terror, the occupier must be held accountable before the courts and history. They are already facing the strength of our warriors,” Zelensky said. Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, the Ukrainian army chief, told Zelensky, “Our guys are doing great on all fronts,” but he called for Ukraine’s Western partners including the United States, the United Kingdom and France to deliver supplies quicker. “There are no vacations in war,” Syrskyi said.

https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/the-conclusions-of-opcw-are-dubious/,https://www.opcw.org/fact-finding-mission,2024-07-29,"Mandate The OPCW Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) is responsible for determining whether toxic chemicals have been used as weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic. The mandate does not include identifying who is responsible for any alleged attacks. On the basis of the FFM’s findings, the OPCW Investigation and Identification Team (IIT) (as the OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) did previously), collects and analyses evidence that may help to identify the perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks in Syria. Establishment With repeated allegations of the use of toxic chemicals for hostile purposes at a number of locations in the Syrian Arab Republic, on 29 April 2014, the Director-General announced the formation of an FFM. The establishment of the FFM was based on the general authority of the OPCW Director-General to seek to uphold at all times the object and purpose of the Chemical Weapons Convention. This authority is reinforced by the relevant decisions of the OPCW Executive Council and the United Nations Security Council resolution (UNSCR) 2118 (2013); and its acceptance by the Syrian Arab Republic. Key findings To date, the FFM has issued 21 reports covering 74 instances of alleged chemical weapons use. The FFM concluded that chemical weapons were used or likely used in 20 instances: in 14 cases the chemical used was chlorine, in three cases the chemical used was Sarin, and in three cases the chemical used was mustard agent. These reports were submitted to the States Parties of the Chemical Weapons Convention and the UN Security Council. All FFM reports are published on the OPCW website. Methodology The FFM’s findings are impartial and based on scientific evidence and methods. FFM experts interview casualties, first responders, treating physicians, and witnesses, and collect physical evidence related to alleged instances of chemical weapons use, such as biomedical and environmental samples. They also gather, review, and analyse documentation relevant to the alleged incidents, including clinical histories, admission records, and investigation reports of casualties and autopsy findings, if available, of victims. Furthermore, FFM experts review and analyse munitions or remnants of munitions reportedly used to carry out the attacks, if deemed feasible and safe. Samples collected are split and sent for analysis to different laboratories of the network of OPCW Designated Laboratories around the globe which use state of the art technology and operate completely independently from each other. The objective of the sampling and analysis is to provide unambiguous evidence of the presence or absence of a particular toxic chemical in a sample.

Finland’s partnership with NATO was historically based on its policy of military non-alignment, which changed following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. - Cooperation began when Finland joined the Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme in 1994 and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (a multilateral forum for dialogue that brings together all Allies and partner countries in the Euro-Atlantic area) in 1997. - For many years prior to its accession, Finland had been one of NATO's most active partners and a valued contributor to NATO-led operations and missions in the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq. - As an 'Enhanced Opportunity Partner'1 (a partner country that makes particularly significant contributions to NATO operations and other Alliance objectives), Finland experienced enhanced opportunities for dialogue and cooperation with the Allies. - In light of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022, Finland (together with Sweden) submitted its official letter of application to become a NATO Ally on 18 May. - On 4 July 2022, following the Madrid Summit of NATO Leaders, Finland and Sweden completed accession talks at NATO Headquarters in Brussels. The then 30 Allies signed the Accession Protocols for Finland and Sweden the following day. - The Accession Protocol for Finland was subsequently ratified by each of the Allies according to national procedures. - On 4 April 2023, Finland became a full member of NATO, upon depositing its Instrument of Accession to the North Atlantic Treaty with the United States government during a ceremony at NATO Headquarters in Brussels. - Under the Partnership Interoperability Initiative, the current Enhanced Opportunity Partners are: Australia, Georgia, Jordan and Ukraine. The road to accession NATO and Finland have long shared common values. As one of NATO’s closest partners, Finland cooperated extensively with the Alliance for several decades, but the country did not aspire to NATO membership. Finland’s partnership with NATO was historically based on its policy of military non-alignment and a firm national political consensus, which NATO has fully respected. Finland’s stance changed following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the biggest security crisis in Europe since the Second World War. After a thorough democratic process, Finland (alongside Sweden) submitted on 18 May 2022 its official letter of application to become a NATO Ally. On 4 July 2022, following NATO’s Madrid Summit, Allied Leaders completed accession talks, signing Accession Protocols for Finland and Sweden the following day. Following the signature of the Accession Protocols, each country had ‘Invitee’ status, allowing their representatives to participate as observers in Allied meetings. Over the following months, Finland’s Accession Protocol was ratified in the capitals of each of the then 30 Allies. Subsequently, Finland acceded to the Washington Treaty (or the North Atlantic Treaty) when the country (represented by the Finnish Foreign Minister) deposited its Instrument of Accession with the United States government (represented by the US Secretary of State) at NATO Headquarters, making Finland a full member of the Alliance on 4 April 2023. Thereafter, Sweden joined the Alliance on 7 March 2024, after Sweden’s Accession Protocol was ratified by all NATO member countries according to their national procedures and its Instrument of Accession was deposited with the US State Department. Key areas of cooperation Finland's cooperation with NATO as a partner was mutually beneficial and included the following activities, many of which it continues to participate in as an Ally: Building capabilities and interoperability - Finland participated in the PfP Planning and Review Process (PARP) and the Operational Capabilities Concept, two frameworks that assist partner countries in planning and evaluating the readiness of its contributions to NATO-led peace-support operations. - Finland participated in NATO and PfP exercises and has declared a variety of infantry, engineering, naval, and air units as potentially available for exercises and operations. - Finland participates in a strategic airlift initiative, namely the Strategic Airlift Capability (SAC) programme. - In 2017, Finland created the Helsinki European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats. The centre is open to participating states and supported by NATO and the EU. - Beginning in 2014, under the Partnership Interoperability Initiative, Finland participated in the Interoperability Platform, which brings Allies together with selected partners that are active contributors to NATO's operations. - Finland and NATO signed a Political Framework Arrangement in 2017 for cooperation on cyber defence. The country also participated in the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, NATO cyber defence exercises and cyber-related 'Smart Defence' projects. - In July 2001, NATO formally recognised the Finnish Defence Forces International Centre (FINCENT) as a PfP Training Centre. FINCENT provides training on military crisis management for staff employed by international organisations such as NATO, the United Nations (UN) and the EU. - Finland has close ties with other Nordic countries and participates in Nordic Defence Cooperation (NORDEFCO), a regional defence initiative that promotes collaboration between Nordic armed forces. President of Finland Alexander Stubb with former NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg (April 2024) Support for NATO-led operations and missions - Finland first participated in a NATO-led operation in 1996 when it contributed a battalion to the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia and Herzegovina. - From 2002, Finnish soldiers worked alongside Allied forces in Afghanistan – first as part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), which completed its mission at the end of 2014, and later as part of the follow-on Resolute Support Mission (RSM) to further train, assist and advise the Afghan security forces and institutions until its completion in September 2021. Finland also contributed over USD 14 million to the Afghan National Army Trust Fund. - Finland provides personnel to the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo (KFOR). - Finland has also participated in NATO Mission Iraq (NMI), NATO's advisory and capacity-building mission in Iraq. - Finland participated in the enhanced NATO Response Force (NRF) in a supplementary role and subject to national decisions. Additionally, Finland signed a memorandum of understanding on Host Nation Support which, subject to a national decision, allowed for logistical support to Allied forces located on, or in transit through, its territory during exercises or in a crisis. Wider cooperation - Finland has engaged with NATO's Resilience Committee and cooperated with Allies on regional assessments, security of supply, critical infrastructure protection, and in providing mutual support in dealing with the consequences of a major accident or disaster in the Euro-Atlantic area. - Finnish civil resources have been listed with NATO's Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre (EADRCC) and Finland has contributed to NATO's pool of preparedness experts. Finland has also provided civil preparedness training to Allies and other partners. - Other practical cooperation has taken place under the Science for Peace and Security (SPS) Programme, which focuses on activities pertaining to counter-terrorism, cyber defence, chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) defence, environmental security, and advanced technology. A noteworthy example was the participation of Finland in the DEXTER Programme, which is developed an integrated system to detect explosives and firearms in public spaces. - Finland has actively supported the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security (WPS), and since 2008 has developed successive National Action Plans in support of the WPS agenda. - Finland is an active supporter of NATO Trust Fund projects in partner countries and has contributed to nearly a dozen so far, including the Partnership Trust Fund, the Defence and Related Security Capacity Building (DCB) Trust Fund and the Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP) for Ukraine Trust Fund. This has included projects for partner countries including shelter and generators, fuel, and medical rehabilitation to Ukraine, and to DCB projects in Georgia, Iraq, Jordan and the Republic of Moldova.",CREDIBLE
https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/there-is-no-evidence-of-russian-involvement-in-the-solarwinds-hacking-attack/,https://usa.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2020_na-kaspersky-experts-connect-solar-winds-attack-with-kazuar-backdoor,2025-01-11,"Woburn, MA – January 11, 2021 – On December 13, 2020, FireEye, Microsoft and SolarWinds announced the discovery of a large, sophisticated supply chain attack that deployed a new, previously unknown malware, Sunburst, against SolarWinds’ Orion IT customers. Today, Kaspersky announced that its experts found various specific code similarities between Sunburst and known versions of Kazuar backdoors – malware that provides remote access to a victim’s machine. The new findings provide insights that can help researchers move forward in the investigation of the attack. While studying the Sunburst backdoor, Kaspersky experts discovered a number of features that overlap with Kazuar, which has been previously identified as a backdoor written using the .NET framework. It was first reported by Palo Alto in 2017 and used in cyber-espionage attacks across the globe. Multiple similarities in code suggest a connection between Kazuar and Sunburst, albeit of an undetermined nature. The overlapping features between Sunburst and Kazuar include the victim UID generation algorithm, the sleeping algorithm and the extensive usage of the FNV-1a hash. According to the experts, these code fragments are not 100% identical, suggesting Kazuar and Sunburst may be related, though the nature of this relation is still not entirely clear. After the Sunburst malware was first deployed in February 2020, Kazuar continued to evolve and later 2020 variants are even more similar, in some respects, to Sunburst. Overall, during the years of Kazuar’s evolution, the experts observed continuous development, in which significant features bearing resemblance to Sunburst were added. While these similarities between Kazuar and Sunburst are notable, there could be a lot of reasons for their existence, including Sunburst being developed by the same group as Kazuar, Sunburst’s developers using Kazuar as inspiration, a Kazuar developer moving to the Sunburst team or both groups behind Sunburst and Kazuar having obtained their malware from the same source. “The identified connection does not give away who was behind the SolarWinds attack, however, it provides more insights that can help researchers move forward in this investigation,” said Costin Raiu, director of Kaspersky’s Global Research and Analysis Team. “We believe it’s important that other researchers around the world investigate these similarities and attempt to discover more facts about Kazuar and the origin of Sunburst, the malware used in the SolarWinds breach. Judging from past experience, for instance, looking back to the WannaCry attack, in the early days, there were very few facts linking it to the Lazarus group. In time, more evidence appeared and allowed us, and others, to link them together with high confidence. Further research on this topic will be crucial for connecting the dots.” Learn more technical details about the similarities between Sunburst and Kazuar in this report on Securelist.

All Allies are party to the NPT and support its universal coverage, full compliance with and implementation of, as well as all other relevant international instruments in this area, such as the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). NATO’s nuclear policy is constantly reviewed and is determined by the Alliance’s nuclear posture and by the place nuclear capacities occupy in NATO’s deterrence and defence strategy. Nuclear weapons are an important element in deterring an eventual aggression against the Alliance, but their role is fundamentally of a political nature, as they are not directed towards specific threats. NATO faces currently a security environment fundamentally changed, increasingly diverse, unpredictable and demanding. At the NATO Summit in Walles (2014), Allies recognized the changed security environment and initiated the strengthening process of the Alliance’s deterrence and defence posture. At the NATO summits in Warsaw (2016) and in Brussels (2018) Allies emphasized their strong commitment to the full implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in all its aspects, including nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation, and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Current concerns of NATO and NATO allies also focus on the development and deployment of nuclear weapons by an increasing number of international actors. For instance, it is estimated that in the next decade Beijing will double its number of nuclear warheads. From the Allied perspective, the size of the Chinese nuclear arsenal strongly recommends China’s participation – as a growing global power – in international arms control arrangements that set limits for the number of nuclear weapons owned. A balanced, transparent and verifiable approach of these arrangements will prevent a new nuclear arms race. At the same time, the demise of The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (“the INF Treaty”), in August 2019, due to both the violation of Treaty terms by the Russian Federation and to the continuing development of new advanced armaments by Moscow, triggered Alliance’s efforts to consolidate its combined conventional, nuclear and missiles defense capacities. NATO will remain a nuclear alliance as long as nuclear weapons exist. The Allies have emphasized on different occasions ( including during the Defence Ministerial Meeting in June 2020) that NATO has no intention to deploy new land-based nuclear missiles in Europe. The road to a world without nuclear weapons is conditioned by a balanced and verifiable arms control architecture and by disarmament. Based on this strategic approach, NATO welcomed the US-Russia nuclear talks which were launched in Vienna on 28 July 2020 and aim at the prospects of a new bilateral nuclear arms control agreement. These talks followed a first meeting in June 2020. They took place less than a year before the expiration (in February 2021) of the New START Treaty (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), which was signed by the US and Russia in 2010 and is the last remaining nuclear arms-control deal between the two countries which together account for 90% of the world's nuclear weapons. Romania’s position The non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) – chemical, biological, nuclear, radiological – represents a fundamental objective related to the multilateral dimension of Romanian foreign policy. Together with its NATO Allies and European Union partners, Romania continues to be firmly committed to the consolidation of the international non-proliferation arrangements. It acts in a pro-active way to support the preservation of the integrity of global non-proliferation architecture. Romania is committed to a world without nuclear weapons, in accordance with the NPT goals, and believes that the only realistic and practical way to achieve this goal is a step-by-step approach promoting international stability, peace and an increased security for all. Nuclear disarmament is a clear goal alongside the need to address collectively and in an appropriate manner the major challenges that we face today from nuclear proliferation. The NPT charts the optimal path towards this goal. Romania strongly supports all initiatives and concrete measures for nuclear disarmament, in an inclusive manner and with the full respect of the sovereignty of all states, as well as of their security concerns and obligations.

https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/armenia-and-azerbaijan-are-part-of-historic-russia-their-independence-is-accidental/,https://www.britannica.com/story/why-did-the-soviet-union-collapse,2025-01-11,"On January 1, 1991, the Soviet Union was the largest country in the world, covering some 8,650,000 square miles (22,400,000 square km), nearly one-sixth of Earth’s land surface. Its population numbered more than 290 million, and 100 distinct nationalities lived within its borders. It also boasted an arsenal of tens of thousands of nuclear weapons, and its sphere of influence, exerted through such mechanisms as the Warsaw Pact, extended throughout eastern Europe. Within a year, the Soviet Union had ceased to exist. While it is, for all practical purposes, impossible to pinpoint a single cause for an event as complex and far-reaching as the dissolution of a global superpower, a number of internal and external factors were certainly at play in the collapse of the U.S.S.R. - The political factor When Mikhail Gorbachev was named general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) on March 11, 1985, his primary domestic goals were to jump-start the moribund Soviet economy and to streamline the cumbersome government bureaucracy. When his initial attempts at reform failed to yield significant results, he instituted the policies of glasnost (“openness”) and perestroika (“restructuring”). The former was intended to foster dialogue, while the latter introduced quasi free market policies to government-run industries. Rather than sparking a renaissance in Communist thought, glasnost opened the floodgates to criticism of the entire Soviet apparatus. The state lost control of both the media and the public sphere, and democratic reform movements gained steam throughout the Soviet bloc. Perestroika exhibited the worst of the capitalist and communist systems: price controls were lifted in some markets, but existing bureaucratic structures were left in place, meaning that Communist officials were able to push back against those policies that did not benefit them personally. In the end, Gorbachev’s reforms and his abandonment of the Brezhnev Doctrine hastened the demise of the Soviet empire. By the end of 1989 Hungary had dismantled its border fence with Austria, Solidarity had swept into power in Poland, the Baltic states were taking concrete steps toward independence, and the Berlin Wall had been toppled. The Iron Curtain had fallen, and the Soviet Union would not long outlast it. - The economic factor By some measures, the Soviet economy was the world’s second largest in 1990, but shortages of consumer goods were routine and hoarding was commonplace. It was estimated that the Soviet black market economy was the equivalent of more than 10 percent of the country’s official GDP. Economic stagnation had hobbled the country for years, and the perestroika reforms only served to exacerbate the problem. Wage hikes were supported by printing money, fueling an inflationary spiral. Mismanagement of fiscal policy made the country vulnerable to external factors, and a sharp drop in the price of oil sent the Soviet economy into a tailspin. Throughout the 1970s and ’80s, the Soviet Union ranked as one of the world’s top producers of energy resources such as oil and natural gas, and exports of those commodities played a vital role in shoring up the world’s largest command economy. When oil plunged from $120 a barrel in 1980 to $24 a barrel in March 1986, this vital lifeline to external capital dried up. The price of oil temporarily spiked in the wake of Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, but by that point the collapse of the Soviet Union was well under way. - The military factor It is a widely held belief that Soviet defense spending accelerated dramatically in response to the presidency of Ronald Reagan and proposals such as the Strategic Defense Initiative. In fact, the Soviet military budget had been trending upward since at least the early 1970s, but Western analysts were left with best guesses in regard to hard numbers. Outside estimates of Soviet military spending ranged between 10 and 20 percent of GDP, and, even within the Soviet Union itself, it was difficult to produce an exact accounting because the military budget involved a variety of government ministries, each with its own competing interests. What can be said definitively, however, is that military spending was consistently agnostic of overall economic trends: even when the Soviet economy lagged, the military remained well-funded. In addition, the military took priority when it came to research and development talent. Technological innovators and would-be entrepreneurs who could have helped support Gorbachev’s partial transition to a market economy were instead funneled into defense industries. - Afghanistan In addition to budgetary matters, the Soviet involvement in Afghanistan (1979–89) was a key military factor in the breakup of the U.S.S.R. The Soviet army, lionized for its role in World War II and a vital tool in the repression of the Hungarian Revolution and Prague Spring, had waded into a quagmire in a region known as the Graveyard of Empires. As many as a million Soviet troops participated in the 10-year occupation, and approximately 15,000 were killed and thousands more were wounded. More than a million Afghans—mostly civilians—were killed, and at least 4 million were externally displaced by the fighting. The army that had bested Hitler and crushed dissent during the Cold War found itself frustrated by mujahideen armed with American surface-to-air missiles. As long as the government controlled the press, dissent about the war in Afghanistan remained muted, but glasnost opened the door to the vocalization of widespread war weariness. The army, perhaps the single most powerful opponent of Gorbachev’s reform efforts, found itself back-footed by the stalemate in Afghanistan, and it lost whatever leverage it might have had in checking the advance of perestroika. In the Soviet republics, the Afgantsy (veterans of the Afghan conflict) agitated against what they perceived to be Moscow’s war. Many soldiers from the Central Asian republics felt closer ethnic and religious ties to Afghans than they did to Russians, and protests were widespread. In the European republics, the cleavage with Moscow was even more dramatic. Antiwar demonstrations broke out in Ukraine, while opposition forces in the Baltic republics viewed the war in Afghanistan through the lens of the Russian occupation of their own countries. This fueled the secessionist movements that proceeded, largely unchecked, to declarations of independence by all three Baltic states in 1990. - The social factor On January 31, 1990, McDonald’s opened its first restaurant in Moscow. The image of the Golden Arches in Pushkin Square seemed like a triumph of Western capitalism, and customers lined up around the block for their first taste of a Big Mac. But such a display was not uncommon in the final years of the Soviet Union; Muscovites queued just as long for morning editions of liberal newspapers. Glasnost had, indeed, ushered in a flurry of new concepts, ideas, and experiences, and Soviet citizens were eager to explore them—whether that involved devouring essays about democratization from leading political philosophers or dipping a toe into a market economy via Western-style fast food. In 1984 Eduard Shevardnadze had told Gorbachev, “Everything is rotten. It has to be changed.” The feeling was not an uncommon one. The Soviet public was disgusted with the widespread corruption endemic to the Soviet state. Gorbachev’s goal with glasnost and perestroika was nothing less than a transformation of the Soviet spirit, a new compact between the Soviet regime and its people. Gorbachev’s chief adviser, Aleksandr Yakovlev, described the challenge facing them: “The main issue today is not only economy. This is only the material side of the process. The heart of the matter is in the political system…and its relation to man.” In the end, the tension between the newly empowered citizenry and a Soviet state with ruined credibility proved too much to overcome, and a last gasp coup attempt by Communist hardliners shattered the Soviet Union. - The nuclear factor Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union and the United States teetered on the edge of mutual nuclear destruction. What few had considered, however, was that the Soviet Union would be brought down by an incident involving a civilian nuclear plant. Gorbachev had been in power for just over a year when, on April 26, 1986, the Unit 4 reactor at the Chernobyl power station in Pryp’yat (now in Ukraine) exploded. The explosion and subsequent fires released more than 400 times the amount of radioactive fallout as the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima. The official response to the disaster would be a test of Gorbachev’s doctrine of openness, and, in that regard, glasnost would be found fatally wanting. Communist Party officials acted quickly to suppress information about the severity of the disaster, going as far as to order that May Day parades and celebrations in the affected area should proceed as planned despite the known risk of radiation exposure. Western reports about the dangerously high levels of wind-transported radioactivity were dismissed as gossip, while apparatchiks quietly collected Geiger counters from science classrooms. Workers were finally able to bring the radiation leak under control on May 4, but Gorbachev did not issue an official statement to the public until May 14, 18 days after the disaster. He characterized the incident at Chernobyl as a “misfortune” and pilloried Western media coverage as a “highly immoral campaign” of “malicious lies.” Over time, Communist Party propaganda was increasingly at odds with the daily experiences of those in the contamination zone who were dealing with the physical effects of radiation poisoning. Whatever trust remained in the Soviet system had been shattered. Decades later, Gorbachev marked the anniversary of the disaster by stating, “even more than my launch of perestroika, [Chernobyl] was perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union five years later.”",CREDIBLE

The Justice Department today announced the ongoing seizure of 32 internet domains used in Russian government-directed foreign malign influence campaigns colloquially referred to as “Doppelganger,” in violation of U.S. money laundering and criminal trademark laws. As alleged in an unsealed affidavit, the Russian companies Social Design Agency (SDA), Structura National Technology (Structura), and ANO Dialog, operating under the direction and control of the Russian Presidential Administration, and in particular First Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Sergei Vladilenovich Kiriyenko, used these domains, among others, to covertly spread Russian government propaganda with the aim of reducing international support for Ukraine, bolstering pro-Russian policies and interests, and influencing voters in U.S. and foreign elections, including the U.S. 2024 Presidential Election. In conjunction with the domain seizures, the U.S. Treasury Department announced the designation of 10 individuals and two entities as part of a coordinated response to Russia’s malign influence efforts targeting the 2024 U.S. presidential election. This announcement follows the designation of actors involved in Doppelganger announced by the Treasury Department in March. “The Justice Department is seizing 32 internet domains that the Russian government and Russian government-sponsored actors have used to engage in a covert campaign to interfere in and influence the outcome of our country’s elections,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “As alleged in our court filings, President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle, including Sergei Kiriyenko, directed Russian public relations companies to promote disinformation and state-sponsored narratives as part of a campaign to influence the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. An internal planning document created by the Kremlin states that a goal of the campaign is to secure Russia’s preferred outcome in the election. The sites we are seizing today were filled with Russian government propaganda that had been created by the Kremlin to reduce international support for Ukraine, bolster pro-Russian policies and interests, and influence voters in the United States and other countries. Our actions today make clear that the Justice Department will be aggressive in countering and disrupting attempts by the Russian government, or any other malign actor, to interfere in our elections and undermine our democracy.” “The Department’s seizure of 32 internet domains secretly deployed to spread foreign malign influence demonstrates once again that Russia remains a predominant foreign threat to our elections,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. “At Putin’s direction, Russian companies SDA, Structura, and ANO Dialog used cybersquatting, fabricated influencers, and fake profiles to covertly promote AI-generated false narratives on social media. Those narratives targeted specific American demographics and regions in a calculated effort to subvert our election. Our republic depends on elections that are free from foreign interference, and we will not rest in our efforts to expose foreign malign influence operations and protect our democracy, without fear or favor.” “Today’s announcement exposes the scope of the Russian government’s influence operations and their reliance on cutting-edge AI to sow disinformation,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray. “Companies operating at the direction of the Russian government created websites to trick Americans into unwittingly consuming Russian propaganda. By seizing these websites, the FBI is making clear to the world what they are, Russian attempts to interfere in our elections and influence our society. The FBI will continue to work with our partners to expose and shutdown these covert influence campaigns.” “This seizure illustrates vividly what the U.S. government and private sector partners have warned for months: the Russian government and its proxies are aggressively accelerating the Kremlin’s covert efforts to seed false stories and amplify disinformation directed at the American public,” said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department’s National Security Division. “Today’s announcement reveals Russia is willing to impersonate our free and open press in its egregious schemes. This is our third disruption of Russian foreign malign influence operations in two months, and the Justice Department remains relentless in protecting Americans from such unacceptable conduct. To Russia, and any other government seeking to stoke discord in our society: know that we will spare no effort and use every available tool to disrupt and expose this malign activity and defend our democratic institutions.” “Protecting our democratic processes from foreign malign influence is paramount to ensure enduring public trust,” said U.S. Attorney Jacqueline C. Romero for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. “As America’s adversaries continue to spew propaganda and disinformation towards the American electorate, we’ll use every tool at our disposal to expose and dismantle their insidious foreign influence campaigns.” The propaganda did not identify, and in fact purposefully obfuscated, the Russian government or its agents as the source of the content. The perpetrators extensively utilized “cybersquatted” domains, a method of registering a domain intended to mimic another person or company’s website (e.g., registering washingtonpost.pm to mimic washingtonpost.com), to publish Russian government messaging falsely presented as content from legitimate news media organizations. In other instances, the perpetrators sought to create their own unique media brands to promote Doppelganger content (e.g., Recent Reliable News). Among the methods Doppelganger used to drive viewership to the cybersquatted and unique media domains was the deployment of “influencers” worldwide, paid social media advertisements (in some cases created using artificial intelligence tools), and the creation of social media profiles posing as U.S. (or other non-Russian) citizens to post comments on social media platforms with links to the cybersquatted domains, all of which attempted to trick viewers into believing they were being directed to a legitimate news media outlet’s website. Overview The affidavit describes the perpetrators’ own internal strategy meeting notes, project proposals, and other records obtained during the course of the investigation. Several notable propaganda project proposals directed against the United States included: - Good Old USA Project: Attachments 8A, 8B - The Guerilla Media Campaign: Attachments 9A, 9B - U.S. Social Media Influencers Network Project: Attachments 10A, 10B Doppelganger’s foreign malign influence efforts were not directed solely against audiences in the United States. Other targets of the perpetrators’ propaganda included Germany, Mexico, and Israel, among others. Doppelganger’s influence campaigns sought to influence the citizenry of those countries to support Russian government objectives, including by undermining the United States’ relationship with those countries. Doppelganger’s use of the U.S.-based domain names at the direction and control of, and for the benefit of, sanctioned persons, including Sergei Vladilenovich Kiriyenko, SDA, and Structura, violates the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). As a result, the accompanying payments for Doppelganger’s online infrastructure violate federal money laundering laws. In addition, Doppelganger’s publication of content on cybersquatted domains with names and content that mimic legitimate media outlets violates federal criminal trademark laws because those domains feature trademarks registered on the Principal Register maintained by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The FBI Philadelphia Field Office is investigating the case. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section and National Security Cyber Section are prosecuting the case, with valuable assistance from the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section.",CREDIBLE

The indictments were announced by U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves, Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen, and FBI Assistant Director in Charge David Sundberg of the FBI Washington Field Office. The first indictment alleges that Dimitri and Anastasia Simes participated in a scheme to violate U.S. sanctions for the benefit of sanctioned Russian broadcaster Channel One Russia and to launder funds obtained from that scheme. Channel One Russia, a state-owned Russian television station, was sanctioned by OFAC on May 8, 2022, for being owned or controlled by, or for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, the Government of the Russian Federation. From at least in or around June 2022 through the present, Dimitri Simes, Anastasia Simes, and others allegedly participated in a scheme to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), by providing services to Channel One Russia, including by serving as a presenter and producer of programming, and by receiving over $1 million, a personal car and driver, a stipend for an apartment in Moscow, Russia, and a team of ten employees from Channel One Russia following its designation by OFAC. The indictment alleges that Dimitri Simes and Anastasia Simes also engaged in a scheme to commit money laundering, knowing the transactions were intended to conceal the proceeds of IEEPA violations. “These defendants allegedly violated sanctions that were put in place in response to Russia’s illegal aggression in Ukraine,” said US Attorney Graves. “Such violations harm our national security interests—a fact that Dimitri Simes, with the deep experience he gained in national affairs after fleeing the Soviet Union and becoming a U.S. citizen, should have uniquely appreciated.” Dimitri and Anastasia Simes maintain a home in Huntly, Virginia. They remain at large and are believed to be in Russia. They are each charged with one count of conspiracy to violate IEEPA, one count of violating IEEPA, and one count of conspiracy to commit international money laundering, each of which each carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. A second indictment alleges that Anastasia Simes further participated in a scheme to violate U.S. sanctions for the benefit of, and to receive funds from, sanctioned oligarch Aleksandr Yevgenyevich Udodov. Udodov was sanctioned by OFAC on February 23, 2023, for operating or having operated in the management consulting sector of the Russian Federation economy. Between at least February 2023 and the present, Anastasia Simes and others allegedly participated in a scheme to violate IEEPA by purchasing art and antiques for the benefit of Udovov from galleries and auction houses in the United States and Europe, and having the items shipped to her residence in Huntly, Virginia, where they were stored for onward shipment to Russia. In return, Anastasia Simes was reimbursed and received a service fee. The indictment alleges that Anastasia Simes also engaged in a scheme to commit money laundering, knowing the transactions were intended to conceal the proceeds of IEEPA violations. (Below are photographs of some of the art and antiques intended for Udodov and stored in Anastasia and Dimtiri Simes’s residence.) In connection with this scheme, Anastasia Simes is charged with one count of conspiracy to violate IEEPA, one count of violating IEEPA, and one count of conspiracy to commit international money laundering, each of which each carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The FBI’s Washington Field Office is investigating both cases. The cases are being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Alexandra Hughes of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia and Trial Attorneys Menno Goedman and Sean O’Dowd of the U.S. Department of Justice’s National Security Division, Counterintelligence and Export Control Section. The case is part of the Justice Department’s Task Force KleptoCapture, an interagency law enforcement task force dedicated to enforcing the sweeping sanctions, export restrictions, and economic countermeasures that the United States has imposed, along with its allies and partners, in response to Russia’s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine. The task force leverages all the Department’s tools and authorities against efforts to evade or undermine the economic actions taken by the U.S. government in response to Russian military aggression.

The EU has implemented laws and supports operational cooperation through non-legislative actions and funding. Cybercrime is a borderless issue that can be classified in three broad definitions: - crimes specific to the internet, such as attacks against information systems or phishing (e.g. fake bank websites to solicit passwords enabling access to victims' bank accounts) - online fraud and forgery: large-scale fraud can be committed online through instruments such as identity theft, phishing, spam and malicious code - illegal online content, including child sexual abuse material, incitement to racial hatred, incitement to terrorist acts and glorification of violence, terrorism, racism and xenophobia Many types of crime, including terrorism, trafficking in human beings, child sexual abuse and drugs trafficking, have moved online or are facilitated online. As a consequence, most criminal investigations have a digital component. EU laws and actions aim to: - improve the prevention, investigation and prosecution of cybercrime and child sexual exploitation - build capacity in law enforcement and the judiciary - work with industry to empower and protect citizens Crime leaves digital traces that can serve as evidence in court proceedings. That is why effective and common EU mechanisms to obtain digital evidence should be established. The European Commission explores options how to support law enforcement authorities in overcoming challenges posed by encryption in the context of criminal investigations. EU law on cybercrime EU rules on cybercrime correspond to and build on different provisions of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. - 2020: Proposal for Interim Regulation on the processing of personal and other data for the purpose of combatting child sexual abuse - 2019: Directive on non-cash payment fraud The directive updates the legal framework, removing obstacles to operational cooperation and enhancing prevention and victims’ assistance, to make law enforcement action against fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment more effective. - 2018: Proposals for Regulation and Directive facilitating cross-border access to electronic evidence for criminal investigations - 2013: Directive on attacks against information systems The directive aims to tackle large-scale cyber-attacks by requiring EU countries to strengthen national cyber-crime laws and introduce tougher criminal sanctions. The directive includes measures that better address new developments in the online environment, such as grooming (offenders posing as children to lure minors for the purpose of sexual abuse). Digital investigations: horizontal issues Encryption Encryption is regarded as an effective way of ensuring the protection of cybersecurity, data protection and privacy. It can help citizens and businesses to defend themselves against the abuse of IT technologies, such as hacking, identity and personal data theft, fraud and the improper disclosure of confidential information. Encryption can also be used by criminals, to hide their actions from law enforcement. This hinders lawful access to important electronic evidence, makes the work of law enforcement authorities’ more challenging, and complicates the process of criminal investigations. What the Commission is doing To support law enforcement authorities in overcoming challenges posed by encryption in the context of criminal investigations, the Commission proposed in the 11th progress report on a more effective and genuine Security Union, concrete non-legislative measures which respect the safeguarding of strong encryption, required for the functioning of the Digital Single Market and do not in any way prohibit, limit or weaken encryption. Encryption remains an on-going and increasing challenge which the Commission will continue to tackle. Dialogues with experts and key stakeholders continue to offer different perspectives and insight on new developments and possible longer-term strategies, taking into account the increasing sophistication and widespread use of encryption tools in communication, as well as the need to safeguarding users’ personal data. Data retention Access to electronic data is important to enable police and public prosecutors to investigate crimes including when committed online or enabled by using internet or telecommunication networks. Access to (non-content) data in turn depends on its availability and retention by communication service providers. Access is always retrospective – a typical investigator’s question could be “Who was accessing the Internet using this IP address two months ago?”. To answer this question, data on all IP address usage would need to be kept, including that of all the persons who did not commit any crimes. As a result, data retention rules should respect fundamental rights such as privacy and data protection as enshrined in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Commission is monitoring developments at national level, and published a study on data retention. The objective is to fill knowledge gaps and gather information about the legal, operational and fundamental rights challenges of mandatory data retention frameworks for criminal investigations and prosecutions, issues of admissibility of evidence, and the impact on electronic communication service providers and their users. Coordination and agency support - EU level: The European Cybercrime Centre Set up by Europol, acts as the focal point in the fight against cybercrime in the Union, pooling European cybercrime expertise to support Member States' cybercrime investigations and providing a collective voice of European cybercrime investigators across law enforcement and the judiciary.

Most purposes explained in this notice rely on the storage or accessing of information from your device when you use an app or visit a website. For example, a vendor or publisher might need to store a cookie on your device during your first visit on a website, to be able to recognise your device during your next visits (by accessing this cookie each time). Vendors179 vendor(s) Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you). A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone. A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often. Vendors43 vendor(s) Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities. If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear. An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles. Vendors132 vendor(s) Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. An online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It wants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on its mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have previously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present you with the corresponding advertisement on the app. A profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having searched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant advertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation. Vendors128 vendor(s) Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns. You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase. You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements. Vendors77 vendor(s) Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents). The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics. An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range. Vendors29 vendor(s) Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers. A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads that are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve their performance. An advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer device. It collects information regarding the way users interact with this new kind of device to determine whether it can build a new mechanism for displaying advertising on this type of device.

Accession negotiations with Ukraine were formally opened in June 2024. The EU and Ukraine also cooperate within the Eastern Partnership. Enlargement EU membership application On 28 February 2022, Ukraine applied for EU membership. On 17 June 2022, the European Commission issued its opinion on the application for EU membership. On 23 June 2022, the European Council granted candidate status to Ukraine. It invited the European Commission to report to the Council on the fulfilment of the conditions specified in the Commission's opinion on the membership application. Accession negotiations In November 2023, the European Commission issued a recommendation to open accession negotiations with Ukraine. In December 2023, EU leaders decided to open accession negotiations with Ukraine and invited the Council to adopt the negotiation framework once the relevant steps set out in the Commission’s report of 8 November 2023 had been taken. Following Ukraine's progress, in March 2024 EU leaders invited the Council to swiftly adopt the draft negotiation framework. - Ukraine report (European Commission, 8 November 2023) - European Council conclusions, 14 and 15 December 2023 - European Council conclusions, 21-22 March 2024 Accession conference meetings Accession negotiations take place at intergovernmental conferences (often called an ‘accession conference’) between ministers and ambassadors of the EU member states and a candidate. Negotiations cover the body of common rights and law (the ‘EU acquis’) and are divided into different chapters, or clusters of chapters, covering different policy fields. Accession conferences can be held at either ministerial or deputy level. On 25 June 2024, the EU held its first intergovernmental conference with Ukraine, formally opening the membership negotiations. Annual progress review Every year, the Council usually adopts conclusions on enlargement that take stock of progress made in each of the EU candidates and partners, including Ukraine, on their European path. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine The EU and its member states firmly condemn Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine. The EU stands firmly with Ukraine and its people, and will continue to provide political, financial, economic, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support to Ukraine and its people for as long as it takes and as intensely as needed. EU measures in support of Ukraine include: - economic assistance - military support - humanitarian aid and civil protection - welcoming refugees - investigation and prosecution of war crimes - protection of children The EU has adopted an unprecedented number of sanctions in response to Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and the illegal annexation of Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. The measures are designed to weaken Russia's economic base, depriving it of critical technologies and markets and significantly curtailing its ability to wage war. Eastern Partnership Association agreement The association agreement under the Eastern Partnership is the main tool to bring Ukraine and the EU closer together. It promotes: - deeper political ties - stronger economic links - respect for common values The Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) is the economic part of the agreement. It provides a framework for the modernisation of Ukraine's economy and trade relations. The association agreement entered into force on 1 September 2017. Association Council The Association Council is the main body established under the EU-Ukraine association agreement to monitor and supervise the implementation of the agreement. The ninth meeting of the EU-Ukraine Association Council took place on 20 March 2024. The EU and Ukraine exchanged views on the situation following Russia’s war of aggression and touched on wider global and regional issues. They also discussed the implementation of the association agreement since the start of the Russian war of aggression. Visa liberalisation Visa facilitation and readmission agreements with Ukraine entered into force in 2008. A visa dialogue was launched the same year. On 11 May 2017, the Council adopted a regulation on visa liberalisation for Ukrainian citizens travelling to the EU for a period of stay of 90 days in any 180-day period.

Deterrence and defence is one of NATO’s core tasks. The Alliance deters aggression by maintaining a credible deterrence and defence posture based on an appropriate mix of nuclear, conventional and missile defence capabilities, complemented by space and cyber capabilities. Allies are significantly strengthening the deterrence and defence of the Alliance as the backbone to their Article 5 commitment to defending each other. The USS Gerald R. Ford sails out of the Oslo Fjord in Norway in May 2023. (Photo: Norwegian Armed Forces) - Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine poses the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic security in decades, shattering peace in Europe and reinforcing the need for NATO to ensure that its deterrence and defence posture remains credible and effective. - In response, NATO has undertaken the biggest reinforcement of its collective defence in a generation, significantly increasing the number of forces on its eastern flank and enhancing its ability to rapidly reinforce any Ally that comes under threat. - This reinforcement includes: - doubling the number of multinational battlegroups on NATO’s eastern flank from four to eight; - regularly exercising the scaling up of forward land forces beyond the battalion-size battlegroups to brigade-size units, when and where required; - ensuring that in-place, combat-ready forces are supported by rapidly available reinforcements, prepositioned equipment, and enhanced command and control; - creating a new NATO Force Model, which provides a larger pool of available and ready forces, improving NATO’s ability to respond to any scenario, including at very short notice; - adopting the most comprehensive and detailed defence plans since the Cold War, improving the coherence of NATO’s collective defence planning with Allies’ national planning; - approving a rotational model of modern air and missile defence systems and capabilities; - developing a new policy for improving logistics support to move, reinforce, supply and sustain forces; - acquiring new and modern equipment, including through joint procurement initiatives and increased investment in defence industrial production; - integrating Finland and Sweden and their capabilities into the Alliance’s plans, forces and command structures; - strengthening the protection of critical undersea infrastructure; - enhancing NATO’s space, cyber, and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) defence capabilities; - conducting more frequent and large-scale training and exercises to demonstrate NATO’s ability to defend any Ally that comes under threat. - In support of all these measures, Allies have made considerable progress in increasing defence spending, including investments in major equipment, taking steps towards fairer burden-sharing within NATO. In 2024, 23 Allies are expected to meet or exceed the target of investing at least 2% of Gross Domestic Product in defence, compared to only three Allies in 2014. - NATO’s ongoing adaptation is driven by two key military concepts: the Concept for Deterrence and Defence of the Euro-Atlantic Area focuses on force employment to deter and defend today, while the NATO Warfighting Capstone Concept offers a vision to guide the Alliance's long-term warfare development to remain militarily strong now and in the future. - Key threats to Allied security - NATO’s purpose: safeguarding the freedom and security of its members - Resilience: the first line of deterrence and defence - Bolstering NATO's deterrence and defence since 2014 - Strengthening deterrence and defence in specific areas - Maintaining the Alliance's military and technological edge - Investing in defence Key threats to Allied security NATO faces the most complex security environment since the end of the Cold War. Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine has shattered peace in Europe and has gravely undermined global security, and is causing enormous human suffering and destruction. Terrorism continues to represent a global security challenge and a threat to stability. At the same time, China’s stated ambitions and coercive policies challenge the Alliance's interests, security and values. The deepening strategic partnership between Russia and China, and their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut and reshape the rules-based international order, are a cause for profound concern. Growing global uncertainty, more sophisticated and disruptive cyber and hybrid threats, the increasing prominence of nuclear weapons in potential adversaries’ strategies, and exponential technological change are all having a substantial impact on the Alliance. Russia is the most significant and direct threat to Allies’ security. It seeks to fundamentally reconfigure the Euro-Atlantic security architecture. It is rebuilding and expanding its military capabilities, and continues its airspace violations and provocative activities. It is waging a campaign of aggressive hybrid actions against Allies, including sabotage, acts of violence, provocations at Allied borders, instrumentalisation of irregular migration, malicious cyber activities, electronic interference, disinformation campaigns and malign political influence, as well as economic coercion. Its irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and coercive nuclear signalling, including its announced stationing of nuclear weapons in Belarus, demonstrate a posture of strategic intimidation. The Alliance is determined to constrain and contest Russia’s aggressive actions, and to counter its ability to conduct destabilising activities towards NATO and Allies. Terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations, is the most direct asymmetric threat to the security of NATO citizens and to international peace and prosperity. Conflict, fragility and instability in Africa and the Middle East directly affect the security of the Alliance and its partners. NATO’s southern neighbourhood, particularly the Middle East, North Africa and Sahel regions, faces interconnected security, demographic, economic and political challenges. These are aggravated by the impact of climate change, fragile institutions, health emergencies and food insecurity. NATO will continue to counter, deter, defend and respond to threats and challenges posed by terrorists and terrorist organisations based on a combination of prevention, protection and denial measures with determination, resolve and in solidarity. NATO’s purpose: safeguarding the freedom and security of its members NATO's essential and enduring purpose is to safeguard the freedom and security of all its members by political and military means. Collective defence is at the heart of the Alliance, as set out in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. NATO's greatest responsibility is to protect and defend Allied territory and populations against attack in a world where peace and security cannot be taken for granted. Deterrence is a core element of NATO's overall strategy: preventing conflict and war, protecting Allies, maintaining freedom of decision and action, and upholding the principles and values it stands for – individual liberty, democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Free societies and the rules-based international order need to be backed by credible transatlantic defence. NATO’s collective strength deters aggression from potential adversaries. At the 2022 Madrid Summit, NATO set a new baseline for its deterrence and defence posture in line with its 360-degree approach, across the land, air, maritime, cyber and space domains, and against all threats and challenges. NATO Leaders built upon this new baseline at the 2023 Vilnius Summit and 2024 Washington Summit, agreeing significant measures to enhance NATO’s deterrence and defence in all domains. In Vilnius, Allies approved a new generation of regional defence plans to strengthen forward defences and increase the Alliance’s ability to rapidly reinforce any Ally that may come under threat. In Washington, they pledged to expand their defence industrial capacity to deliver the critical capabilities needed for collective defence. NATO's deterrence and defence posture is based on an appropriate mix of nuclear, conventional and missile defence capabilities, complemented by space and cyber capabilities. NATO maintains the freedom of action and flexibility to respond to the full spectrum of challenges with an appropriate and tailored approach. Resilience: the first line of deterrence and defence Enhancing national and collective resilience is an integral part of NATO's deterrence and defence posture. This means strengthening the capacity of societies to prepare for, respond to, recover from and adapt to the full range of threats and hazards. Russia’s war against Ukraine, growing geopolitical competition and the many other security challenges faced by the Alliance today underscore the importance of NATO’s “all hazards” and “whole of society” approach to resilience. This means preparing, empowering and investing in the ability of societies to defend themselves against a wide range of threats – from cyber attacks to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear incidents; terrorism; pandemics; natural disasters; and growing strategic threats, including against democratic systems, critical infrastructure, and supply chains. Allies boost their resilience by addressing vulnerabilities that can otherwise be used as leverage or be targeted by adversaries. Resilience is therefore an important aspect of deterrence by denial: persuading an adversary not to attack by convincing it that an attack will not achieve its intended objectives. Resilience also requires close civil-military cooperation, as it impacts NATO's ability to conduct its missions and maintain the mobility of troops and equipment. Ensuring that national and military forces under NATO command are adequately supported with civilian resources and infrastructure is a core feature of NATO's resilience efforts. Since 2014, NATO has been providing guidelines to assist national authorities in improving their resilience across seven baseline requirements by reducing potential vulnerabilities. These requirements are updated regularly to reflect the evolving nature of the challenges faced by the Alliance. In line with the NATO 2030 agenda and the 2021 Strengthened Resilience Commitment, the 2022 Strategic Concept stresses the importance of adopting a more integrated and better coordinated approach to resilience within the Alliance, including against Russian coercion, and in supporting NATO partners to counter malign interference and aggression. Partnerships with non-NATO countries and other organisations are essential to reinforcing Allies' national and collective resilience, and to supporting the Alliance's planning and preparedness through the sharing of information and best practices. Bolstering NATO's deterrence and defence since 2014 Throughout its history, NATO has continuously adapted its deterrence and defence to meet the challenges of the evolving security environment. Over the past decade in particular – since Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and its increasingly threatening posture towards the Alliance – NATO has overhauled its plans and structures to ensure that Allies are ready to respond to any threat from any direction. 2014 – Readiness Action Plan The Readiness Action Plan (RAP), launched at the 2014 Wales Summit, was a major driver for change in the Alliance's deterrence and defence posture. The RAP included assurance measures for NATO Allies in Central and Eastern Europe to reassure their populations, deter potential aggression and reinforce their defence. It also included adaptation measures – longer-term changes to NATO’s forces and command structure – which launched the most significant reinforcement of NATO's collective defence since the end of the Cold War. 2016 – Strengthened deterrence and defence posture, including enhanced Forward Presence Building on the RAP, NATO Heads of State and Government approved a strengthened deterrence and defence posture at the 2016 Warsaw Summit. It provided the Alliance with a broad range of options to be able to respond to any threats from wherever they arise to protect NATO territory, populations, airspace and sea lines of communication. Allies agreed to establish an enhanced Forward Presence in the eastern part of the Alliance, and in 2017 four NATO multinational battlegroups were deployed in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Additional measures were taken to reinforce security in the south-east of the Alliance, with a tailored Forward Presence in the Black Sea region. Furthermore, a number of measures have been undertaken to adapt the Alliance to the challenges emanating from the South, including capacity-building, dedicated exercises and advance planning, as well as setting up the Regional Hub for the South in Naples, Italy, which contributes to NATO's situational awareness. 2018 – NATO Readiness Initiative At the 2018 Brussels Summit, NATO Leaders reiterated their resolve to bolster the Alliance's readiness, responsiveness and reinforcement to respond to threats in a 360-degree approach. A NATO Readiness Initiative was launched to enhance the Alliance's rapid-response capability, either for reinforcement of Allies in support of deterrence or collective defence, including for high-intensity warfighting, or for rapid military crisis response, if required. It consisted of providing 30 heavy or medium manoeuvre battalions, 30 kinetic air squadrons and 30 major naval combatants at 30 days' readiness or less. 2020 – Concept for the Deterrence and Defence of the Euro-Atlantic Area (DDA) In 2020, Allies approved the Concept for the Deterrence and Defence of the Euro-Atlantic Area (DDA). The DDA Concept provides a single, coherent framework for NATO Allies to contest, deter and defend against the Alliance’s main threats in a multi-domain environment. It also strengthens the Alliance’s preparedness to address challenges by enhancing NATO’s advance planning for potential crisis and conflict scenarios. Under the DDA Concept’s framework, NATO has developed strategic, domain-specific and regional military plans to improve the Alliance’s ability to respond to any contingencies. These plans are fully coherent with the planning of Allied forces and the new NATO Force Model, and they include posture management, capability development (including training and exercises), and command and control. 2021 – NATO 2030 agenda and NATO Warfighting Capstone Concept At the 2021 Brussels Summit, Allies agreed the NATO 2030 agenda to strengthen the Alliance further and guide its adaptation for the future. This agenda includes deterrence and defence as a core element of the transatlantic bond between Europe and North America, which is at the heart of the Alliance. Allied Leaders welcomed the significant progress made to strengthen NATO’s deterrence and defence posture since 2014, including increased defence spending, modern capabilities, enhanced political and military responsiveness, and higher readiness. They also welcomed the ongoing implementation of the DDA Concept and approved the NATO Warfighting Capstone Concept, which provides a long-term vision for maintaining and developing NATO’s decisive military edge, ensuring that the Alliance continuously develops its military and technological advantage as the character of conflict evolves. 2022 – Response to Russia’s war against Ukraine Following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, NATO Leaders met in Brussels on 24 March 2022 to address the consequences of Russia’s actions and to take measures to further strengthen NATO’s deterrence and defence. They decided to deploy four multinational battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, in addition to those already present in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, effectively doubling the number of battlegroups on NATO’s eastern flank from four to eight. They also decided to step up cyber defences and scale up exercises focused on collective defence and interoperability. At the Madrid Summit in June 2022, NATO Leaders made decisions to significantly strengthen the Alliance’s deterrence and defence posture. To that end, Allies agreed to adjust the balance between in-place forces and reinforcement. They agreed that the forward deployed battlegroups on the Alliance’s eastern flank should be able to be scaled up to brigade-size units, where and when required. These in-place forces are underpinned by credible, rapidly available reinforcements, prepositioned equipment, and enhanced command and control. Allies also agreed a new NATO Force Model, which strengthens and modernises the NATO Force Structure, supports the Alliance’s core tasks and resources its new generation of military plans. Allies agreed to ensure a substantial and persistent presence on land, at sea and in the air, including through stronger integrated air and missile defence. 2023 – New generation of regional defence plans and Defence Production Action Plan At the 2023 Vilnius Summit, NATO Leaders agreed to modernise NATO for a new era of collective defence, approving the most comprehensive and detailed defence plans since the Cold War. This new generation of regional defence plans is significantly improving the coherence of NATO’s collective defence planning with Allies’ national planning of their forces, posture, capabilities, and command and control. These plans direct how NATO will deter and defend against any aggressor from any direction, explaining how, in the event of a crisis, Allied forces would defend forward and defeat complex threats across NATO territory. They also set out specifically what will be expected of Allies in a crisis. Driven by the increasingly complex threat environment, this is a larger, more demanding, ask of Allies than NATO has made since the end of the Cold War. The plans ensure that Allies can provide the right forces at the right time and in the right places. In Vilnius, Allies also agreed a new Defence Production Action Plan to bolster engagement with the defence industry, accelerating joint procurement, boosting production capacity and enhancing Allies’ interoperability. 2024 – NATO Force Model and NATO Industrial Capacity Expansion Pledge At the 2024 Washington Summit, Allies welcomed the progress made since the 2022 Madrid and 2023 Vilnius Summits on reinforcing and modernising NATO for a new era of collective defence. In order to ensure the effectiveness of the defence plans agreed in Vilnius, Allies are implementing the NATO Force Model agreed in Madrid, which delivers a larger pool of dedicated combat-capable forces, harnessing regional expertise and geographic proximity to improve military responsiveness. As part of these efforts, they also established a new multinational and multi-domain Allied Reaction Force in July 2024, which provides more options to respond swiftly to threats and crises in all directions. The NATO Force Model and the Allied Reaction Force have replaced the NATO Response Force as the framework to organise, manage, activate and command Allied national forces, providing a larger pool of available forces and improving NATO’s ability to respond at very short notice. In Washington, Allied Leaders also agreed the NATO Industrial Capacity Expansion Pledge to increase their cooperation with the defence industry and urgently deliver the most critical capabilities, including ammunition and air defence systems. This Pledge builds off the Defence Production Action Plan, which Allies agreed in 2023. NATO Leaders also agreed at the Washington Summit to strengthen NATO’s command and control, and welcomed ongoing efforts by Allies to increase their presence on NATO’s eastern flank. In addition, Allied Leaders are committed to improving NATO’s ability to reinforce and sustain Allied forces across Alliance territory, including through greater logistics coordination and the prepositioning of ammunition and equipment. Strengthening deterrence and defence in specific areas In addition to the measures listed above, over the past decade NATO has strengthened its deterrence and defence in the following specific areas. Integrated Air and Missile Defence NATO Leaders have agreed to improve the readiness, preparedness and interoperability of NATO’s Integrated Air and Missile Defence (IAMD) through activities across all domains and along the spectrum of conflict. The Alliance is bolstering the integration and coherence of its IAMD through regular training, and the rotational presence of modern air defence systems and capabilities, with an initial focus on the eastern flank. These efforts will support NATO’s readiness, including its ability to deter aggression and manage escalation risks in a crisis that has a nuclear dimension. Nuclear deterrence and arms control NATO continues to address the security implications of Russia's ongoing modernisation of its nuclear forces, including its large stockpile of theatre-range weapons, and expansion of its novel and disruptive dual-capable delivery systems, which pose a significant risk to Alliance security. Russia’s violations and selective implementation of its arms control obligations and commitments have contributed to the deterioration of the broader security landscape. The Alliance is responding by strengthening its advanced conventional capabilities, investing in new platforms – including fifth-generation fighter aircraft – and adapting its exercises, intelligence, and air and missile defence posture. It is doing so while taking all necessary steps to ensure that its nuclear deterrence policy and forces remain credible, effective, safe and secure. At the same time, NATO remains strongly committed to effective arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation, and continues to call for all actors, including Russia and China, to engage constructively. Exercises Exercises remain an integral part of NATO's deterrence and defence posture, since military training is an essential requirement to maintain the Alliance's readiness levels and improve interoperability. NATO training and exercises simulate both conventional and nuclear dimensions of a crisis or conflict, facilitating greater coherence between conventional and nuclear components of NATO’s deterrence and defence posture across all domains and the entire spectrum of conflict. Exercises also play an important role in deterrence by communicating NATO’s capability, readiness and resolve to potential adversaries. Cyberspace NATO has recognised cyberspace as a domain of operations in which it must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, at sea and in space. The creation of a Cyberspace Operations Centre in Belgium in 2018 and the formation of counter-hybrid support teams to assist Allies in need also bolster the Alliance's deterrence efforts. At the 2021 Brussels Summit, Allies endorsed a new Comprehensive Cyber Defence Policy, which supports NATO’s core tasks and overall deterrence and defence posture to enhance the Alliance’s resilience in cyberspace. At the 2024 Washington Summit, Allies agreed to establish the NATO Integrated Cyber Defence Centre to enhance network protection, situational awareness and the implementation of cyberspace as an operational domain. Space At the December 2019 Leaders' Meeting in London, NATO declared space as a fifth operational domain (alongside air, land, sea and cyberspace). The information gathered and delivered through satellites is critical for NATO activities, operations and missions, including collective defence, crisis response and counter-terrorism. The NATO Space Centre established in 2020 in Germany serves as a focal point for sharing information, coordinating Allies' efforts and supporting NATO's operations and missions. At the 2021 Brussels Summit, NATO recognised that attacks to, from or within space could present a clear challenge to the security of the Alliance and could lead to the invocation of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. In 2023, NATO announced plans to establish the Alliance Persistent Surveillance from Space (APSS) initiative to enhance space-based surveillance and intelligence for the Alliance, which will improve situational awareness and decision-making. Cooperation with the European Union NATO's adaptation efforts continue in all domains and in areas that cover a whole-of-society approach to defence and security, such as civil preparedness and countering hybrid threats. The Alliance strengthens these activities through increased cooperation with the European Union (EU), which includes complementary and interoperable capability development to avoid duplication and contribute to transatlantic burden-sharing. Maintaining the Alliance's military and technological edge While the Alliance needs to be able to preserve peace today, it also needs to prepare for the increasingly unpredictable security environment of the future. To this end, at the 2021 Brussels Summit, Allied Leaders agreed to the full implementation of the NATO Warfighting Capstone Concept, which supports having a more proactive and anticipatory approach to military adaptation. Keeping its technological edge has always been an essential enabler of NATO's ability to deter and defend against potential adversaries. Innovations in emerging and disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence, autonomous weapons systems, big data and biotech are changing warfare. To help preserve its technological edge, NATO has agreed an implementation strategy for emerging and disruptive technologies. It also established a Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA) and, at the 2022 Madrid Summit, launched a multinational Innovation Fund, bringing together governments, the private sector and academia to bolster NATO's technological edge. The Alliance will play an important role as a forum for cooperation on various security-related aspects of these emerging technologies. Investing in defence The Defence Investment Pledge, adopted by NATO Leaders at the 2014 Wales Summit, called for all Allies to stop cuts to defence budgets and move towards the NATO-agreed guideline of spending at least 2% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on defence within a decade. Allies also agreed, in that same timeframe, to move towards spending at least 20% of annual defence expenditure on new major equipment and related research and development. Since then, Allies have all increased their defence spending, further developed their forces and capabilities, and have contributed to Allied operations, missions and activities. At the 2023 Vilnius Summit, NATO Leaders agreed a renewed Defence Investment Pledge, making an enduring commitment to investing at least 2% of GDP annually in defence. They also affirmed that in many cases, expenditure beyond 2% of GDP will be needed in order to remedy existing shortfalls and meet the requirements across all domains arising from a more contested security order. At the same time, NATO Leaders committed to investing at least 20% of their defence budgets on major equipment, including defence-related research and development. Allies also committed to contributing the necessary forces, capabilities and resources to the full range of NATO operations, missions and activities. In 2024, 23 Allies are expected to meet or exceed the target of investing at least 2% of GDP in defence, compared to only three Allies in 2014. Over the past decade, European Allies and Canada have steadily increased their collective investment in defence – from 1.43% of their combined GDP in 2014, to 2.02% in 2024, when they are investing a combined total of more than USD 430 billion in defence.",CREDIBLE

Gives Iraq Until Jan. 15 to Leave Kuwait or Face War : Gulf crisis: Historic measure passes 12 to 2, with China abstaining. It is only the second time the Security Council has voted to use military force. UNITED NATIONS — In a historic vote, the U.N. Security Council on Thursday authorized war to oust Iraq from Kuwait. It was only the second time since the United Nations was founded in 1945 that members of the world body voted to use military force. But unlike measures adopted at the start of the Korean War recommending the immediate commitment of troops, Thursday’s resolution gives Iraqi President Saddam Hussein at least until Jan. 15 to withdraw his forces from Kuwait. The council passed the measure by a vote of 12 to 2, with China abstaining. The six-week cooling-off period is certain to feature intensive diplomacy, which will reach a crescendo as the deadline nears. After Jan. 15, war will not automatically follow. Although the resolution allows military force as an option, it does not require it. The Security Council chamber was packed to overflowing, the hallways outside jammed with reporters, when the 15 council members--represented by two ambassadors and 13 even more senior foreign ministers--cast their ballots. Precisely at 5:27 p.m. EST, Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in his capacity as the council’s president, a post he holds this month, called for the vote. “Will those in favor of the draft resolution please raise their hands,” Baker said in a firm voice. Twelve nations signaled approval. “Those opposed or against,” Baker asked. As expected, Cuba and Yemen voted in the negative. “Abstentions?” China abstained. China, as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council--the others are the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union--has the power to veto a measure before the council. Just before the vote, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen had said he could not vote in favor of the resolution because it provided for military force. The resolution was passed by the smallest margin of any of the 10 anti-Iraq measures adopted since Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. Several of the previous measures were passed unanimously; others were approved 13-2. The latest resolution found Iraq “in flagrant contempt of the council” for ignoring previous measures, which included strict demands for an immediate withdrawal from Kuwait, a trade and air embargo and the release of all hostages. It authorized member states to “use all necessary means” to implement the withdrawal of Iraq’s troops and “to restore international peace and security in the area.” “We have a chance to make this Security Council and the United Nations true institutions for peace and justice around the globe,” Baker said as he convened the meeting. “We must not let the U.N. go the way of the League of Nations. “Today’s vote marks a watershed in the history of the United Nations,” he said after the balloting--speaking as secretary of state, not as the council’s president. “A dangerous man has committed a blatant act of aggression in a vital region at a critical moment in history. ”. . . If he (Hussein) should come to dominate the resources of the gulf, his ambitions will threaten all of us here and the economic well-being of all nations,” Baker said. “If Iraq should emerge from this conflict with territory or treasure or political advantage, then the lesson will be clear: aggression pays.” The secretary of state, who later was to characterize the moment as “the hinge of history,” said: “. . . Members of the council, we are at a crossroads. Today, we show Saddam that the sign marked ‘Peace’ is the direction he should take.” “We have been faced with the first extremely grave test of the post-Cold War era, and we are coping with it,” said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. Shevardnadze said the delay until Jan. 15 is “one last sincere chance to give common sense a chance to work or, if you will, for the instinct of self-preservation to come into play.” Later, in the hallway outside the council, standing before a tapestry of Picasso’s “Guernica” mural depicting the horrors of war, the Soviet foreign minister underscored his warning. “As for face-saving, there is no longer this question,” Shevardnadze said. “He (Saddam Hussein) now has to save his people, his country. He has to save the world. He has to save peace in the region and global peace.” The foreign minister said that memories of the Soviet Union’s 1980-89 involvement in Afghanistan and in Czechoslovakia in 1968 for the time being mitigated against the Soviet Union sending forces to join the troops in the desert. But he sternly warned that if Iraq attacks Soviet citizens, his nation could act swiftly to employ military force. Speaking before the vote, Iraq’s U.N. ambassador, Abdul Amir Anbari, delivered a half-hour diatribe against the United States, accusing the Bush Administration of organizing a “malicious, brutal and aggressive policy” against his nation. “Peace is our goal,” the Iraqi delegate said. “We work for it. We desire it. If war is imposed upon us by the United States, this will be our destiny.” Anbari pledged that the Iraqi people would defend themselves “against injustice and tyranny.” Before the meeting, as he entered the U.N. building, the Iraqi used much stronger language. “If attacked, we’ll never surrender,” he told reporters. Yet for all the stress on the threat of war, many delegates told the Security Council that they saw Resolution 678 as an opportunity for peace. “It is not yet too late to solve this peacefully,” said Canadian External Affairs Secretary Joe Clark. “We have offered the government of Iraq a pause for good will. ”. . . The choice between peace and war is now in the hands of Iraq.” Malaysia’s foreign minister also cautioned prudence. “Malaysia warns against any action that would lead to the virtual destruction of Iraq,” Abu Hassan Bin Haji Omar said, stressing that any military action should not go beyond the liberation of Kuwait. Canada and Malaysia joined the United States, Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Finland, France, Romania, the Soviet Union, Britain, and Zaire in voting for the resolution. Cuba and Yemen voted against it. “The Security Council has taken a decision of immense portent,” said U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. “I would like to stress that, even on the most stringent reading, the resolution just adopted envisages at least 45 days of earnest effort to achieve a peaceful solution of the crisis.” Under gray skies, caravans of foreign ministers converged on the U.N. building earlier in the day. As the diplomats entered the Security Council, buses of schoolchildren also arrived to take tours of the world organization, where guides extol the virtues of peace and humanitarian aid. In fighting for passage of 678, Baker lobbied up to the last minute, to the doors of the council chamber. In a final blitz, he met with the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, Cuba, China, Britain, Ethiopia, Finland, France and Canada. In the last two weeks, he traveled from the Middle East to Europe to South America to meet with officials of all the 14 other nations on the council. As part of the lobbying process, Cuba and China were granted high-level contact with the United States that they had been denied previously. Baker’s meeting with the Cuban foreign minister in New York was the first publicly acknowledged high-level contact in more than 30 years. Foreign Minister Qian will visit Washington today, becoming the first senior Chinese official to be invited to the capital since the Tian An Men Square massacre in June, 1989. In explaining his decision to abstain rather than approve the crucial resolution, Qian said before the vote, “The Chinese delegation has difficulty in voting for this resolution because it authorized the use of force.” His nation, Qian said, had voted for previous resolutions against Iraq because “although the sanctions are severe, they fall outside of the use of force. “China will not cast its veto on this draft resolution either,” he added. A disappointed Bush Administration official said Thursday night that China had missed a chance to improve its strained relations with the United States when it voted to abstain. U.S. officials had sought to persuade China to join with the other four permanent members of the council in supporting the use of force. “We’d hoped for more,” said this official. “They (Chinese officials) have lost another opportunity here to try to improve their image in this country, to try to show that they shared certain values with the rest of the international community.” It was not clear whether Foreign Minister Qian, who flew from Beijing to New York City on Wednesday, had asked Baker for further concessions in U.S. policy toward China on the eve of the U.N. vote. Earlier this week, the Administration eased its restrictions on high-level contacts between U.S. and Chinese officials in order to permit Qian to visit Washington today. The Beijing government has also been urging the Bush Administration to lift its restrictions on World Bank loans to China and on U.S. military and technology sales to China. Chinese officials have repeatedly said they favor an Arab solution to the gulf crisis and oppose the use of force by superpowers in the Mideast. In contrast to the Korean War resolutions which were adopted in June, 1950, and which spoke openly of military force, the latest Persian Gulf resolution adopts the euphemism “all necessary means” to avoid the word war. In 1950, the Security Council authorized military action within days of North Korea’s invasion of South Korea--a vote made possible only because the Soviet Union, which would have vetoed the measure, was boycotting the United Nations. By contrast, Thursday’s use-of-force resolution came months after Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait and after numerous attempts by the Security Council to persuade Saddam Hussein to withdraw. Zaire will hold the Security Council’s presidency on Jan. 15, when the resolution’s ultimatum expires. In the pre-vote debate Thursday, Kuwait spoke first. The foreign minister of the exiled government, Sheik Sabah al Ahmed al Sabah, told the council that so far the prospects were not good for peace and “war is the only avenue to insure restoration of our rights.” Reviewing the council’s previous resolutions, Sabah added, “All of these efforts ran against a stone wall of intransigence.” Also speaking before the vote, Yemen--the only Arab member of the Security Council--urged the council to give more time for existing economic sanctions to have an effect on Iraq. Yemen’s U.N. ambassador, Abdalla Ashtal, said the resolution authorizing force “is so broad and vague” that it is not limited to enforcement of previous resolutions. “In the annals of the United Nations, it will be remembered as the war resolution,” he said. “. . . It looks like patience is a rare commodity these days.” Colombian Foreign Minister Luis Fernando Jaramillo told the council that “this pause of good will must not be misinterpreted by Saddam Hussein.” The Colombian diplomat said if Iraq ignores the moratorium on the use of force, it must bear all the responsibility for what happens next. Cuba said the invasion and occupation of Kuwait by Iraq should be condemned, but it opposed “a resolution that constitutes a virtual declaring of war.” In his remarks to the council, Baker said the military pause until Jan. 15 will be observed unless Iraq uses chemical or biological weapons or abuses any of its hundreds of foreign hostages. BACKGROUND It has been 40 years since the U.N. Security Council last sanctioned the use of force against a renegade nation. That was in June, 1950 after North Korea invaded South Korea, prompting a U.S.-led call for U.N. intervention. The Soviet Union was boycotting Security Council sessions to protest the seating of China’s Nationalist government, when a hurriedly prepared resolution allowing use of force against North Korea was adopted. The war was to last three years and cost America more than 50,000 dead and 100,000 wounded. Times staff writer Jim Mann in Washington contributed to this article. TEXT OF RESOLUTION This is the text of the Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force if Iraq does not withdraw from Kuwait before Jan. 15, 1991 : The Security Council, recalling and reaffirming its Resolutions 660 (1990), 661 (1990), 662 (1990), 664 (1990), 665 (1990), 666 (1990), 667 (1990), 669 (1990), 670 (1990), 674 (1990) and 677 (1990), Noting that, despite all efforts by the United Nations, Iraq refuses to comply with its obligation to implement Resolution 660 (1990) and the above subsequent relevant resolutions, in flagrant contempt of the council, Mindful of its duties and responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations for the maintenance and preservation of international peace and security, Determined to secure full compliance with its decisions, Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations: 1. DEMANDS that Iraq comply fully with resolution 660 (1990) and all subsequent relevant resolutions and decides, while maintaining all its decisions, to allow Iraq one final opportunity, as a pause of goodwill, to do so; 2. AUTHORIZES member states cooperating with the government of Kuwait, unless Iraq on or before 15 Jan. 1991 fully implements, as set forth in Paragraph 1 above, the foregoing resolutions, to use all necessary means to uphold and implement Security Council resolution 660 (1990) and all subsequent relevant resolutions and to restore international peace and security in the area; 3. REQUESTS all states to provide appropriate support for the actions undertaken in pursuance of Paragraph 2 of this resolution; 4.

He continued in an October 9, 2023, email to Lead Stories: Ukraine is in an existential battle against Russia - why would it be selling anything to Hamas? Hamas only has one state backer: Iran. Hamas is not a proxy of Iran, but it is a partner. A 2020 State Department report said Iran has heavily supported militant groups in the Palestinian territories: Iran has historically provided up to $100 million annually in combined support to Palestinian terrorist groups, including Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. These terrorist groups have been behind a number of deadly attacks originating from Gaza, the West Bank, Syria, and Lebanon, including attacks against Israeli civilians ... Raphael Cohen, a senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation, said in another October 9, 2023, email to Lead Stories he's ""skeptical,"" adding that ""it's not particularly likely that Ukrainians would sell weapons to Hamas ... for a variety of reasons."" He listed several of them: First off, it's going to anger the people who they rely on for support, so it would be strategically stupid. Second, they need those weapons to defend themselves, so they're not really in a place to begin supplying weapons elsewhere. And then, when you think about who would have a vested interest in leaking this story or making this story up, it sounds awfully like Russian misinformation to me, at least. In the sense that Russia has a vested interest in trying to interrupt particularly American supplies of weaponry to Ukraine. Additionally, Cohen said such a narrative -- Ukraine supplying weapons to Hamas -- would further complicate efforts to get another round of military aid through Republicans in Congress. Michael Meier, acting director of the International Humanitarian Law Clinic at Emory Law, echoed Cohen in an October 9, 2023, email to Lead Stories. He said: I believe it is unlikely [Ukraine] would sell weapons to Hamas. First, they need all the weapons they can get for their fight so don't really have any excess weapons to sell. Second, the US is a major supplier of arms to Ukraine. They know Israel is a major ally to the US. It makes no sense they would sell weapons to Hamas and risk that relationship.

Belarus, a close Russian ally that has provided support for Moscow's 28-month full-scale war in Ukraine, said last week that Kyiv was bolstering its forces along the frontier. According to Reuters, the Kremlin said on Monday the report was a cause of concern. ""It is not the first time Belarus offers information about Ukraine presenting a threat and strengthening itself,"" border guard spokesman Andriy Demchenko told Ukrainian TV. ""This is another part of the information operation conducted by Belarus with support by Russia."" He said the border remained a concern, and Ukraine was strengthening it with engineering while maintaining the necessary number of troops to prevent any provocations. He also said that Belarus had been conducting military exercises since June 21, and that blaming Ukraine for friction at the border could be aligned with those drills. On Sunday, the Belarus Defense Ministry claimed it had information showing Ukraine had been moving troops, weapons, and military equipment to the border, in particular in Zhytomyr region. Minsk also said its own forces had deployed additional air defenses to protect the border area from drones, after claiming to have shot down a Ukrainian quadcopter earlier last week.

What do you do if you fall through the ice while wearing 20 kilograms of military gear? Cold Response 2022 is a long-planned exercise bringing together thousands of troops from NATO Allies and partners, testing their ability to work together in cold weather conditions across Norway – on land, in the air and at sea. The host country Every year, NATO organises dozens of military exercises. NATO members also organise national exercises that include other Allies. Cold Response 2022 is organised by the Norwegian Armed Forces. Learn more about the exercise on their website. Over the coming weeks, Allied and partner armed forces will trek across the vast wilderness, conduct live-fire drills, leap into freezing lakes, and much more. It's all about training vital skills, making sure that our armed forces are prepared to respond to any threat or crisis – and keep our countries and people safe. Cold Response 2022 is bringing together Allies from Europe and North America, demonstrating the enduring transatlantic bond at the heart of NATO. The basics - WHO: Around 30,000 troops from 27 countries from Europe and North America - WHAT: Training together in cold weather exercises – on land, in the air and at sea - WHERE: NATO Ally Norway and surrounding seas - WHEN: March-April 2022 - WHY: Helping Allies and partners practise working together so that they are prepared for any situation Cold Response 2022 is a long-planned and regular exercise, which Norway hosts biannually. This year's exercise was announced over eight months ago. It is not linked to Russia's unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine, which NATO is responding to with preventive, proportionate and non-escalatory measures. Did you know? Norway was a founding member of NATO in 1949. Why did Norway, a neutral country with close links to its neighbours, join an Atlantic alliance in 1949 instead of a Scandinavian union?

There's a reason that Norway hosts the NATO Centre of Excellence for Cold Weather Operations! But many other NATO Allies host exercises and help develop this expertise as well, from the bitterly cold Baltics to the remote volcanic beaches of Iceland to the Canadian High Arctic. Check out the videos below to see cold-weather troops in action. From Arctic Express to Trident Juncture – a long legacy of exercises in Norway Norway has hosted exercises with NATO Allies and partners since the early 1950s.

Thank you, Minister. Thank you, dear Andrii. It is my fifth visit to Ukraine since Russia launched the full-scale invasion. I came to Ukraine before that, but since the war of aggression started, this is the fifth visit. And it's maybe the last one, in any case, as High Representative. But it is not a goodbye visit. This is a visit with a clear purpose, coming from the European Union Council in Budapest and after the American elections. The clear purpose of this visit is to stress European Union support to Ukraine. This support remains unwavering. This support is absolutely needed for you to continue defending yourself against Russia’s aggression. And thank you for recognizing that this has been my personal priority since day one of the full-scale invasion. I was visiting Donbas some days before the invasion, and immediately after, I did everything I could in order to mobilize [EU’s] financial resources to arm Ukraine to the European Peace Facility and to put on the table of the [EU] Council for the approval of the Member States a strong package of sanctions, both individual sanctions and sectoral sanctions. And now we are close to 1.000 days since this full-scale invasion. But also, don't forget – I'm sure you don't forget, but maybe the world is not aware – that it is 4.000 days since the aggression started in 2014. In the wall [that I have seen today] full of pictures of Ukrainian soldiers who they lost their lives, [it can be clearly seen that] this started in 2014. So, 1.000 days since the full-scale invasion, 4.000 days since the start of the aggression in 2014. And today, Ukraine and Ukrainian people continue being attacked by swarms of drones and missiles targeting civilian objects and trying to terrorize the civilian population, the Ukrainian people. And winter is here, and by attacking the electricity system and destroying the electricity capacity of Ukraine, Russia's Putin wants to plunge Ukraine into the cold and darkness. Allow me to recall that from day one I said clearly: “Ukraine doesn't need applauses. President Zelensky and the Ukrainian people don't need standing ovations, don't need to be told every time that they are very brave and their fight is very important.” It's good to say that, but the important thing is to provide tanks, fighter jets – I said that since the beginning – air defences and ammunition. You don't fight a war without ammunition. You don't fight a war without the military capacity that you need. And I have been constantly pushing for more and faster. This has been my permanent call. We have to do more and faster. And it's still true. We have to do more and faster. More military support, more training capacities, more money, faster supplies, and also the permission to strike the enemy’s military targets on its territory. It's not enough to stop the arrows, you have to attack the archers. This is something in which I want to insist. You insist [on it], rightly so, and it's truly, absolutely true. We cannot only shoot down the arrows. We do that a lot. We need to eliminate the archers [exercising] the right of self-defence of Ukraine. We need faster deliveries and fewer self-imposed red lines. Fewer self-imposed red lines. Because time [for Ukraine] is measured in human lives and the extent of destruction. Every day that we lose discussion about how much support are we going to provide, this is measured on Ukrainians losing lives. And now Putin has enlisted North Korean soldiers to join the war. They are there. They are at your borders. And by increasing the military cooperation between Russia and the so-called Democratic [People’s] Republic of Korea, North Korea, they show how this war is further globalizing. I just visited Japan and South Korea to discuss how to increase pressure on North Korea, but I am afraid the presence of North Korea [in this war] is a fact, and it can only increase unless we put a lot of pressure on North Korea. Also, the security of South Korea depends on Ukraine, and is defended here too. The world peace and security depend on how the war goes here in Ukraine, against Ukraine. But apart from supporting you to defend yourself, we have been also supporting your diplomatic efforts, supporting Ukraine's peace formula, which for us is the only way to achieve a just and lasting peace. There are different ways of reaching peace, but the only one that matters is a just and lasting peace. And on that our position is clear: It is for Ukraine to decide when to sit at the negotiation table and on which terms. And we, the European Union, we stand firmly on your side on this. But let's not be naive. Putin doesn't want to negotiate and will not negotiate unless he is forced to do it. This is made clear by all interlocutors in the world. That we have seen by his ruthless and barbaric action over the past years, it's not a speculation, it's a fact of life that has been proved by his behavior. And allow me to remark that we, the European Union, we have supported Ukraine militarily until now with about $45 billion. And we are aware that we need to continue increasing our support. We have also started to invest with the proceeds from Russian frozen assets, and with them to buy weapons, or more important, to help you to produce weapons here in Ukraine. You don't need to buy the weapons produced by others. It's much more efficient that you produce your own weapons by increasing your industrial capacity. And for now, $400 million will go into supporting your defense industry, and more will come using this Danish model and increasing the support - it's very important what I am saying - in order for you to have your own capacity to produce. And I have the chance to visit a factory this afternoon during my visit in order to see directly the progress we are doing. Also, Minister, I want to announce that yesterday we extended the mandate of our training mission for Ukraine (EUMAM) for two more years and increased the ambition of this training mission in order for this mission to correspond better to your needs, which I know are huge. We have already trained 60.000 Ukrainian soldiers, and we will reach 75.000 by the end of the winter. I mentioned sanctions at the beginning. Yes, we are on the 15th package of sanctions against Russia, and we have to tighten measures against circumvention of these sanctions because Russia cannot produce without foreign parts, foreign chips, and other components. So, we have to use the sanctions in order to isolate industrial capacity of Russia from the components they need to import from the rest of the world. We mentioned also the attacks against your electricity infrastructure. We have provided more than $2 billion to repair, to stabilize, and connect your electricity network to the European Union network. And recently, we have increased the capacity to export electricity to from 1,7 gigawatts to 2,1 gigawatts. The figures matter, but the important thing is that your grid is connected with the European Union grid, and you are importing the electricity that Russia wants to prevent you from producing at home. Finally, the F-16 has arrived to Ukraine, and air defence systems are increasing, although I know very well they are still not enough. Minister, you mentioned that today it was 35 years since the Berlin Wall fell, and I want to remember this day. I want to remember that that moment marked the end of the Cold War, and we thought that the world order could be an order of peace and cooperation. But this hope has definitely vanished with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The hope of a world based on cooperation, multilateralism, building peace and prosperity went definitely out with this invasion. And with this invasion, we see an imperialistic Russia trying to grab by force territory and control of a neighbour. But we also see a strong Ukraine, a candidate to join the European Union, firmly anchored on the European Union path. And allow me to stress the importance of this fact. Ukraine is today a candidate to be a member of the European Union, something that was difficult to imagine 35 years ago. And now you are on track to become a member of our family. And this is the most important security commitment that we can provide to you. And believe me, we will do everything in order to support you on the reforms needed in order to make the membership a reality. And I want to congratulate you, the Ukrainian people, because this is an endeavour for the Ukrainian people, not only for the government, because in the last report that we approved at the European Union Commission, in the enlargement progress report, in the difficulties that you are living, you still managed to advance on key reforms. Finally, dear Minister, next week I will chair the regular meeting of the European Union foreign and defence ministers. And both you and Minister Umerov will join us. [Russian aggression] It will be high on the agenda, as it has been since the starting of the war. It has been a priority topic, and I will convey to Member States the importance of our continued support, both in the diplomatic field with the Foreign Ministers Council, and in the defence and security[field] in the Council that joins the Defence Ministers of the European Union Member States. We will make the case for boosting political and especially military support to Ukraine, especially now at this critical hour. Slava Ukraini! Q&A Q: A quick first question to both of you, and then a question just to the Minister. What can or should Europe do more concretely to help Ukraine if Donald Trump cuts US support to Ukraine? And to the Minister, is Ukraine willing to cross any of its red lines in terms of conceding territory to Russia or renouncing its NATO ambitions under any Trump peace plan? And have you invited Donald Trump formally to visit Ukraine since his election, and do you expect a visit soon? On the 27th of June we signed the European Union-Ukraine Joint Security Commitment. It is a long-term commitment by 27 Member States to provide broad support in all areas of military, financial, military and political assistance for a period of 10 years. This commitment remains valid. But it is certainly too early to make any hasty judgment about what administration that is still not in place - is still not yet in place and will take still two months to be in place - could take. And I cannot speculate about it. What I can say is that our security commitments remain valid and that our action has been so important, even more important than the US action. Because if you add up all kinds of support to Ukraine, military, civilian, humanitarian, financial, we from the European Union have provided 122 billion of assistance to Ukraine, which is about 50%, 47% to say exactly the figures, of all support that Ukraine has received. 47% of global support comes from the European Union, while the US share is about 40%. So I don't want to speculate. I cannot say foresee what an administration which is not yet in place will do, and even less to define which could be the answer of the European Union to something that is not today a concrete proposal from an administration that still is not working. But 122 billion of European Union support, 47% of the whole global support is there, money coming from the Russian frozen assets, a new loan decided by the G7 to which the European Union contributes with 35 billion. We are almost at 1 million ammunition shells being provided and we will continue looking for more. 75.000 Ukrainian soldiers being trained by our mission shows clearly the will that we have proved in order to support Ukraine. Q: As President Zelensky said, at least 1.000 North Korean soldiers are already in Russia, even more, some of them have taken part of fights. That's why my question for you, how will you respond to that fact? Are you considering at least to send [military] instructors to Ukraine? We understood that this decision needs support of all Member States of EU. Well, certainly the participation, it seems that already active participation of North Korean troops in the war of aggression of Russia against Ukraine is one of the most worrisome things that has happened in the last days. This marks a globalization of the war. Who could have imagined? Who could have imagined North Korean troops fighting against Ukraine? And last week before coming here, I was in Seoul, I was in South Korea, not by accident. I was there just in order to put all diplomatic pressure on the Indo-Pacific area and in particular on North Korea through the neighbours, in order to make them understand that this is a worrisome step and we will continue putting all diplomatic pressure in order to try to avoid that this presence could increase. About your specific question on the training mission to act in Ukrainian territory, yes, I still don't have a consensus among Member States in order to make this request fulfilled, but it doesn't prevent the training mission continue doing what they do, as I mentioned before, 75.000 soldiers: already 60.000 and 15.000 more before the winter. This is not a defensive mission. We try to train the Ukrainian soldiers as close as possible to the Ukrainian border, but it's not per se a defensive mission. It can be done somewhere else. And that's what we are doing. For the time being, there is no consensus to do that in the Ukrainian territory. I cannot exclude that this will happen, but my job is to try the make the mission to work and increase the number of Ukrainian soldiers being trained because I know personally that a soldier sent to the front line without the adequate training has difficulties to survive, not only to send soldiers, but well-trained and well-equipped soldiers is the way to win a war.

The doctrine now says an attack from a non-nuclear state, if backed by a nuclear power, will be treated as a joint assault on Russia. The update was proposed in September and rubber stamped on Tuesday, the 1,000th day of the war with Ukraine. It also follows Washington’s decision on Monday to allow Ukraine to fire long-range US missiles into Russia. Under the changes, a large attack on Russia with conventional missiles, drones or aircraft could meet the criteria for a nuclear response, as could an attack on Belarus or any critical threat to Russia's sovereignty. Any aggression against Russia by a state which is a member of a coalition would be seen by Moscow as aggression from the whole group. The updates expand the number of countries and coalitions, and the kinds of military threats, subject to a possible nuclear response, according to state-run news agency Tass. Putin has threatened the use of nuclear weapons before, and Ukraine has criticised it as ""nuclear sabre-rattling"" to deter its allies from providing further support. But Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said ""we strongly are in favour of doing everything to not allow nuclear war to happen"". Speaking at a press conference at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, Mr Lavrov said a declaration signed by the group, which includes Russia ""clearly said we want to move towards a world free of nuclear weapons"". Announcing the change, the Kremlin urged other countries to study the changes. ""This is a very important text,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, according to Tass, adding ""it should become a subject to a very deep analysis"". On Monday, Russia warned of ""an appropriate and tangible"" response to US President Joe Biden's move to let Ukraine use ATACMS missiles to strike the country. Such an attack inside Russian territory ""would represent the direct involvement of the United States and its satellites in hostilities against Russia"", a foreign ministry statement said. Mr Peskov said on Tuesday that the new doctrine was published ""in a timely manner"" and that Putin had requested it be updated earlier this year so that it was ""in line with the current situation"", AP reported.",CREDIBLE

NATO is a defensive alliance of 32 countries from Europe and North America. Learn more: What is NATO? - 2. Why does NATO exist? NATO exists to defend its member countries and their one billion citizens. It does this by bringing together the governments and the armed forces of the 32 Allies, and by providing a security guarantee that an attack on one of them is an attack on all of them. Learn more: NATO’s purpose Learn more: Collective defence and Article 5 - 3. Is Ukraine a NATO member? Ukraine is not a NATO member. Ukraine is a NATO partner country, which means that it cooperates closely with NATO but it is not covered by the security guarantee in the Alliance’s founding treaty. Learn more: NATO member countries Learn more: NATO partners - 4. Will Ukraine join NATO? Yes. NATO member states (called ‘NATO Allies’) agreed at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Ukraine will become a member of NATO, noting that its next step would be to submit an application to the Membership Action Plan (MAP), a NATO programme covering political, economic, defence, resource, security and legal reforms of aspirant countries. At the 2023 Vilnius Summit, Allies removed the requirement for Ukraine to pursue a MAP, which will change Ukraine’s membership path from a two-step process to a one-step process. At the 2024 Washington Summit, Allies stated that they will continue to support Ukraine on its irreversible path to NATO membership, reaffirming that they will be in a position to extend an invitation for Ukraine to join the Alliance when Allies agree and conditions are met.

NATO is helping Ukraine defend itself against Russia's war of aggression by coordinating the delivery of aid from Allies and partners to Ukraine. Together, NATO Allies account for 99% of all military aid to Ukraine. Through NATO’s Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP) and related funds, Allies have pledged around EUR 800 million (approximately USD 870 million) to meet Ukraine's critical needs for non-lethal aid, including cold-weather clothing, body armour, fuel, transport vehicles, secure communications, combat rations, demining equipment and medical supplies. In addition, under the CAP, Allies have committed to supporting Ukraine further with a multi-year assistance programme, which will help Ukraine transition from Soviet-era to NATO standards, training and doctrines; help rebuild Ukraine's security and defence sector; and continue to cover critical needs. NATO has also upgraded political ties by establishing the NATO-Ukraine Council, a forum for crisis consultation and decision-making where all NATO members and Ukraine sit as equals. NATO member countries are sending weapons, ammunition and many types of light and heavy military equipment to Ukraine, including anti-tank and air defence systems, howitzers, drones, tanks and fighter jets. NATO's Article 5 security guarantee and its iron-clad promise of collective defence provides Allies with the confidence that they can send weapons to Ukraine without diminishing their own security. Furthermore, Allied forces are training Ukrainian troops to use this equipment. All of this is making a difference on the battlefield every day, helping Ukraine to uphold its right of self-defence, which is enshrined in the United Nations Charter. To coordinate all of these equipment donations and the training of Ukrainian forces, Allies have agreed to establish NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU), which will be based in Wiesbaden, Germany and have logistics hubs in the east of the Alliance, staffed by nearly 700 personnel from Allied and partner countries. To ensure that all of this support continues, Allies have made a Pledge of Long-Term Security Assistance for Ukraine. Under this Pledge, Allies have agreed to provide a minimum baseline funding of EUR 40 billion within the next year, and to provide sustainable levels of security assistance for Ukraine to prevail. Many Allies are also providing humanitarian aid to civilians and hosting millions of Ukrainian refugees. Allies are working with relevant stakeholders in the international community to hold accountable all those responsible for war crimes, including conflict-related sexual violence. Allies have also worked closely to support international efforts to enable exports of Ukrainian grain and to alleviate the global food crisis. In the longer term, the Alliance is committed to assisting Ukraine and supporting efforts on its path of post-war reconstruction and reforms. All of these initiatives constitute a bridge to Ukraine’s membership in NATO.

How has NATO supported Ukraine since Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014? Since Russia’s illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea in 2014, NATO has helped to reform Ukraine’s armed forces and defence institutions, including with equipment and financial support. Allies have also provided training for tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops. Ukrainian forces have also developed their capabilities by participating in NATO exercises and operations. Since 2016, NATO’s support has been organised through a Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP), which includes a wide range of capacity-building programmes and trust funds, focused on key areas like cyber defence, logistics and countering hybrid warfare. Allied Leaders agreed a strengthened CAP at the 2022 Madrid Summit, and further support to Ukraine under the CAP at the 2023 Vilnius Summit and 2024 Washington Summit. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, NATO and Allies have been providing unprecedented levels of support to Ukraine (see FAQ #5 above). Learn more: Relations with Ukraine - 7. What is NATO’s position on Ukraine’s occupied territories? Since Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea and destabilisation of eastern Ukraine in 2014, NATO has adopted a firm position in full support of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders. The Allies strongly condemn and do not recognise Russia’s illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea, and denounce its temporary occupation. NATO also condemns Russia’s illegal attempt to annex four regions of Ukraine – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – in September 2022, which is the largest attempted annexation of European territory by force since the Second World War. The sham referenda in these regions were engineered in Moscow and imposed on Ukraine. They have no legitimacy, and NATO does not recognise them. These lands are Ukraine and will always be Ukraine. The overwhelming vote in the United Nations General Assembly condemning Russia’s attempted annexations sent a clear and strong message that Russia is isolated and that the world stands with Ukraine, in defence of the rules-based international order. Learn more: Statement by the North Atlantic Council on the so-called “referenda” in parts of Ukraine Learn more: NATO Secretary General condemns Russia’s illegal attempts to annex Ukrainian territory - 8. Why isn’t NATO sending troops or closing the skies over Ukraine? NATO’s actions are defensive, designed not to provoke conflict but to prevent conflict. The Alliance has a responsibility to ensure that this war does not escalate and spread beyond Ukraine, which would be even more devastating and dangerous. Enforcing a no-fly zone or deploying combat troops to Ukraine would bring NATO forces into direct conflict with Russia. This would significantly escalate the war and lead to more human suffering and destruction for all countries involved. Learn more: NATO Secretary General press conference, 23 March 2022 - 9. What are NATO and Allies doing to impose costs on Russia? NATO Allies and partners have imposed unprecedented costs on Russia, including severe sanctions that are helping starve the Kremlin’s war machine of resources. Allies continue to refine the sanctions in order to increase the pressure on Moscow. These efforts will make it harder for Russia to rebuild its tanks, manufacture missiles and finance its war. President Putin’s decision to attack Ukraine is a terrible strategic mistake, for which Russia will pay a heavy price, both economically and politically, for years to come. Learn more: Statement by NATO Heads of State and Government, 24 March 2022 - 10. What is NATO doing to enhance the defence of its countries and citizens? Following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Allies activated NATO’s defence plans and deployed thousands of extra troops from both sides of the Atlantic. NATO rapidly established four new multinational battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, in addition to the existing battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. The eight battlegroups extend all along NATO’s eastern flank, from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south. Today, NATO has 500,000 troops at high readiness working across all domains – land, sea, air, cyber and space. At the 2022 Madrid Summit, Allies agreed a fundamental shift in NATO’s deterrence and defence. This included strengthening forward defences, preparing the battlegroups in the eastern part of the Alliance to be enhanced from battalions up to brigade level, transforming the NATO Response Force and increasing the number of high-readiness forces to well over 300,000. These forces will be underpinned by more pre-positioned equipment and supplies; more forward-deployed capabilities; and upgraded defence plans, with forces pre-assigned to defend specific Allies. All of this constitutes the biggest overhaul of Allied collective defence and deterrence since the Cold War. At the 2023 Vilnius Summit, Allies built upon their Madrid decisions by approving new regional defence plans to counter the two main threats to the Alliance: Russia and terrorism. NATO Leaders also pledged to invest a minimum of 2% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) annually on defence, and endorsed a Defence Production Action Plan to accelerate joint procurement, boost interoperability and generate investment and production capacity. Under this Action Plan, Allies have agreed more than USD 10 billion in framework contracts, covering critical needs like 155 mm artillery, anti-tank guided missiles and main battle tank ammunition. At the 2024 Washington Summit, Allies reaffirmed their commitment to investing 2% of GDP in defence (noting that two thirds of Allies have reached that threshold) and pledged to expand their defence industrial capacity to urgently deliver the most critical capabilities. They welcomed the progress made since the Madrid and Vilnius Summits on reinforcing and modernising NATO for a new era of collective defence, and agreed to further enhance NATO’s Integrated Air and Missile Defence with new ballistic missile defence assets, and to boost NATO’s cyber defence with a new NATO Integrated Cyber Defence Centre. NATO Allies are also increasing the resilience of their societies and infrastructure. This includes enhancing cyber capabilities and defences, and providing support to each other in the event of cyber attacks. Following the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Allies have enhanced their naval presence in the Baltic and North Seas, and are increasing security around other key installations and pieces of critical infrastructure. NATO members are stepping up intelligence-sharing and surveillance across all domains, to ensure the protection of critical undersea and energy infrastructure. Allies are also enhancing their preparedness for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats, strengthening their energy security, and boosting resilience to hybrid threats, including disinformation.

What is NATO’s response to Russia’s dangerous rhetoric around nuclear, chemical and biological weapons? Russia’s threatening nuclear rhetoric is dangerous and irresponsible. NATO takes these threats seriously, but will not be intimidated. NATO remains vigilant and conveys a clear message to Russia that a nuclear war cannot be won and should never be fought. Any use of nuclear weapons by Russia would fundamentally change the nature of the war, and it would have severe consequences for Russia. Furthermore, NATO Allies are profoundly concerned by the reported use of chemical weapons by Russia against Ukrainian forces. Any use by Russia of a chemical or biological weapon would be a violation of international law and a war crime, and result in severe consequences. Learn more: Weapons of mass destruction Learn more: Combined Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defence Task Force - 12. What is NATO’s position on countries supporting Russia’s war? NATO condemns all those who are facilitating, and thereby prolonging, Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. Belarus continues to enable Russia’s war by making available its territory and infrastructure, including for Russia’s announced stationing of nuclear weapons in Belarus. North Korea and Iran are fuelling Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine by providing direct military support to Russia, such as munitions and uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). The People’s Republic of China (PRC) has become a decisive enabler of Russia’s war against Ukraine through its so-called “no limits” partnership and its large-scale support for Russia’s defence industrial base, including the transfer of dual-use materials, such as weapons components, equipment and raw materials that serve as inputs for Russia’s defence sector. The PRC cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation. NATO Allies urge all countries not to provide any kind of assistance to Russia’s aggression. Learn more: 2024 Washington Summit Declaration The security of Ukraine is of great importance to NATO and its member states. The Alliance fully supports Ukraine’s inherent right to self-defence, and its right to choose its own security arrangements. Ukraine’s future is in NATO. Relations between NATO and Ukraine date back to the early 1990s and have since developed into one of the most substantial of NATO’s partnerships. Since 2014, in the wake of Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea, cooperation has been intensified in critical areas. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, NATO and Allies have provided unprecedented levels of support. more >>DEEP DIVE - RELATED TOPICS › Read more about the Alliance, its policies, activities and structures",CREDIBLE

(infographic) EU response to Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine The EU and its member states stand united in their unwavering support for Ukraine and its people, and firmly condemn Russia’s military aggression. Latest news EU adopts 15th package of sanctions against Russia On 16 December 2024, the Council adopted the 15th package of sanctions against Russia. The new measures weaken Russia's military and industrial complex and address the circumvention of sanctions through targeting Putin's shadow fleet. The EU has also sanctioned 54 individuals and 30 entities responsible for actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. What does the EU say about Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine? The EU and its member states strongly condemn Russia's brutal war of aggression against Ukraine and the illegal annexation of Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. They also condemn Belarus' involvement in Russia's military aggression. Since February 2022, the European Council and the Council of the European Union have been meeting regularly to discuss the situation in Ukraine from different perspectives. The European Council reiterates its resolute condemnation of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, which constitutes a manifest violation of the UN Charter, and reaffirms its continued support for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. European Council conclusions, 19 December 2024 EU leaders demanded repetedely that Russia immediately cease its military actions, unconditionally withdraw all forces and military equipment from Ukraine and fully respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence. They emphasised the right of Ukraine to choose its own destiny and commended the people of Ukraine for their courage in defending their country. In response to the military aggression, the EU has massively expanded sanctions against Russia, by adding a significant number of persons and entities to the sanctions list, and by adopting unprecedented restrictive measures. The EU has shown unity and strength and has provided Ukraine with humanitarian, political, financial and military support. The European Council reconfirms the European Union’s unwavering commitment to providing continued political, financial, economic, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support to Ukraine and its people for as long as it takes and as intensely as needed. Russia must not prevail. European Council conclusions, 19 December 2024 The EU is committed to continue to show solidarity and provide support to the refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine and the countries hosting them. It is also coordinating with partners and allies, within the UN, OSCE, NATO and the G7. On several occasions, the European Council condemned Russia’s indiscriminate attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, and urged Russia to stop the systematic missile strikes against Ukraine's energy infrastructure. EU leaders underlined that Russia, Belarus and all those responsible for war crimes and the other most serious crimes will be held to account for their actions in accordance with international law. Latest European Council conclusions: What measures has the EU taken against Russia? Individual and economic sanctions The EU has adopted massive and unprecedented sanctions in response to Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and the illegal annexation of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions of Ukraine. The measures are designed to weaken Russia's economic base, deprive it of critical technologies and markets and significantly curtail its ability to wage war. The EU is closely coordinating its actions with its partners and allies, including NATO, G7, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Norway, South Korea and Australia. - Timeline - Packages of sanctions against Russia since February 2022 - Sanctions against Russia - Sanctions against Russia explained In this context, the EU has also adopted sanctions against Belarus, Iran and North Korea in response to those countries' involvement in the Russian aggression against Ukraine. Violation of sanctions added to list of EU crimes Currently, member states have different definitions of what constitutes a violation of restrictive measures and what penalties should be applied in the event of such a violation. This could lead to: - different degrees of enforcement of sanctions - a risk of these measures being circumvented This is why, on 28 November 2022, the Council adopted a decision to add the violation of restrictive measures to the list of ‘EU crimes’ included in the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. On 12 April 2024, the Council adopted new rules to make sure that the violation of restrictive measures is criminalised. The law defines what conduct constitutes a criminal offence and the appropriate penalties. - criminal offences include: helping people to bypass an EU travel ban, trading sanctioned goods or running transactions with those hit by EU restrictive measures - dissuasive penalties: penalties vary depending on the offence but should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive - stricter enforcement: member states will be required to step up their efforts to make sure EU sanctions are respected Suspension of visa facilitation The Council adopted a decision that fully suspends the visa facilitation agreement between the EU and Russia. Consequently, the general rules of the visa code will apply to Russian citizens. This will result in: - an increase in the visa application fee from €35 to €80 - the need to present additional documentary evidence - increased visa processing times - more restrictive rules for the issuance of multiple-entry visas The decision entered into force on the day of its adoption and applies as of 12 September 2022. Non-acceptance of Russian travel documents issued in Ukraine On 8 December 2022, the Council adopted a decision on the non-acceptance of Russian travel documents issued in Ukraine and Georgia. This decision is a response to Russia’s practice of issuing Russian international passports to residents of the occupied regions. It also follows Russia’s unilateral decision to recognise the independence of the Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in 2008. Russian travel documents issued in, or to persons resident in, Russian-occupied regions in Ukraine or breakaway territories in Georgia will not be accepted as valid travel documents for obtaining a visa or crossing the borders of the Schengen area. How is the EU supporting Ukraine and the Ukrainian people? The EU and its citizens stand in full solidarity with Ukraine and its people. The EU has taken unprecedented measures to support Ukraine and its people. Measures include: - economic and financial assistance - humanitarian aid - civil protection support - military support - reception of refugees through the EU temporary protection mechanism - support in the investigation and prosecution of war crimes - support in the reconstruction of a democratic Ukraine How has the EU responded to the market impact of the war? The Russian invasion of Ukraine has had a disruptive effect on global markets. World prices for key commodities such as fuels and fertilisers skyrocketed in 2022. The war has caused uncertainty about the security of the energy supply in the EU. Russia's attacks on crops and transport infrastructure have hampered Ukraine's ability to export its agri-food production, which has further aggravated the global food crisis. Energy crisis EU countries have stood united in their response to increasing energy prices and threats to the EU's energy security. The emergency measures adopted by the Council to ensure a sufficient and affordable energy supply have helped calm the markets. The price of gas, which reached an unprecedented peak in August 2022, is now relatively stable. EU coordinated measures have focused on: - diversifying energy supplies and their routes - securing gas in national reserves - reducing energy bills for citizens and businesses - enhancing solidarity among EU countries - preventing price spikes - moving faster towards cleaner energy EU countries are shifting away from Russian fossil fuels with gas imports from Russia going from 40% of the total imports in 2021 to 15% in 2023. The EU is moving fast towards cleaner energy and autonomy. Food security EU countries have responded to the global food crisis by: - providing emergency relief to those most in need - helping developing countries make their food production more sustainable - supporting open and barrier-free trade - collaborating closely with global partners Thanks to the so-called solidarity lanes facilitated by the EU, millions of tonnes of grain and oilseed have been exported from Ukraine since May 2022. Food gets to countries in need in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.

These commitments and pledges leverage innovative instruments, such as IBRD and IDA loans, IBRD loans guaranteed by partners, donor grants and equity, IFC blended finance and MIGA guarantees. The World Bank Group’s Role The World Bank Group is uniquely positions to help rebuild Ukraine as we bring strong oversight practices and expertise in reconstruction, particularly in agriculture, energy, infrastructure/transport and social sectors, as well as global experience in supporting development-oriented reforms. We have expanded existing projects, established multi-donor trust funds, and channeled guarantees and parallel financing from donor countries. We routinely monitor our Ukraine portfolio for evidence of fraud and corruption and have robust mechanisms in place to swiftly deal with any reports of irregularities. We primarily work in areas where other organizations are not present, such as in Ukraine’s social sectors, including health, social protection, and education. We collaborate with bilateral and other multilateral development banks including the IMF and EU (on reforms), EBRD and EIB (on investment). We are harmonizing procurement practices in Ukraine with other MDBs. The World Bank Group (IBRD, IFC, and MIGA) is working with the Ukrainian government and partners to identify opportunities for private financing of Ukraine’s reconstruction. Reforms that prepare Ukraine to rebuild and improve the investment climate are critical. The government has asked the World Bank Group for advice on reforms and investments to prepare the country for EU accession (many of which have been included in the “Ukraine Plan” with the EU). World Bank PEACE. Since the start of Russia’s invasion, donor support has been deployed through the World Bank’s project Public Expenditures for Administrative Capacity Enhancement (PEACE) to help the government of Ukraine meet urgent needs and provide core public services. PEACE is widely viewed as having helped the government survive the war by providing adequate budget support and sustaining its capacity to deliver essential public services. | PEACE support is reaching: 10 million “pensioners” (covering those in old-age poverty or who are vulnerable) and pay salaries to 500,000 education employees, 145,000 government employees, and 56,000 first responders. It is keeping more than 12,000 schools open. | This support has reached 15 million Ukrainians and is helping to provide wages for government and school employees, pensions for the elderly, salaries for public servants, and social programs for the vulnerable. To ensure money goes where it is intended, the World Bank has deployed a range of mechanisms designed to monitor service delivery and check for fraud and corruption. The World Bank also introduced framework projects to respond to priority needs, support recovery and build capacity for reconstruction in health, energy, transport, housing, agriculture and education. These emergency operations mobilize partner resources through an innovative and flexible design that allows funds to be disbursed quickly, can be scaled as necessary, and can absorb additional financing as it becomes available. They include appropriate fiduciary, environmental and social safeguards. IBRD funding is secured thanks to the bilateral guarantees provided by development partners. - 3.8 million doses of childhood vaccinations. - 2.3 million receiving primary health care. - 65,000 families receiving compensation to make emergency repairs to their homes. | The Bank is also supporting development policy and investment operations to needed to strengthen the country’s economic policy framework and enhance its macro-financial stability as well as provide urgent relief to households, support reforms of public resources expenditures and help markets function better. IFC IFC launched a $2 billion Economic Resilience Action program to support Ukraine's private sector during Russia’s invasion. Since February 2022, IFC invested almost $2 billion including $530 million mobilized to bolster Ukrainian agriculture, financial, technology and telecoms sectors, address energy crisis, help implement urgent repairs in the residential sector and support municipalities hosting IDPs. This includes $547 million in trade finance guarantees to keep key inputs coming and continue grain exports, $465 million to agrifood companies and $70 million to the technology sector, $360 million to banks to reach SMEs, $217 million to telecom sector. In addition to financial support, IFC’s program includes analytical work, advisory services, and pre-investment projects to enable private investment in Ukraine’s reconstruction. Addressing the energy crisis, IFC is working on near-term opportunities to help spur alternative business models in the current legislative environment and preparing for the scale-up needed in the medium term, subject to the adoption of key reforms, and is providing risk-sharing facilities and advisory services to partner banks to unlock new financing for distributed clean energy. This is expected to unlock €120 million in commercial loans for distributed clean energy in the short-term. IFC has also provided trade finance to enable the import of energy-efficient food processing equipment, and import of emergency mobile gas turbines. MIGA Since the start of the invasion, MIGA has issued $227 million in 6 new guarantees using $48.3 million in donor funds, which implies that $1 of donor funding supports $4.7 in guarantees in Ukraine. MIGA also established the SURE TF to help deploy a two-fold strategy in Ukraine: (a) enable private investment by providing guarantees (political risk insurance (PRI) and credit enhancement) to investors and lenders; (b) ensure that projects are implemented in accordance with global best practices on meeting integrity, environmental, social, and climate standards. Amidst limited availability of private reinsurance, SURE TF enables MIGA’s guarantee issuance in Ukraine by sharing up to 75% of the risk. In the immediate term, MIGA is providing guarantees to support trade in essential goods, continued bank lending to firms including SMEs, as well real sector projects which have clear demonstration effects. Once peace returns, MIGA expects to use the reinsurance market to provide PRI guarantees for real sector projects at scale. The SURE’s fund size as of October 2024, which apart from contributions also accounts for administrative fees, investment income, and SURE TF’s share of premium income, was $114.12 million. URTF To swiftly mobilize efforts for reconstruction, the World Bank has established the Ukraine Relief, Recovery, Reconstruction and Reform Trust Fund (URTF), a multi-donor fund to channel grant contributions from donor partners. The URTF’s objectives are to help sustain the country’s administrative and service delivery capacity, conduct relief efforts, as well as to support the planning and implementation of Ukraine’s recovery, resilient reconstruction, and reform agenda. The URTF supports the World Bank’s Framework Projects and ensures that the Ukrainian authorities can quickly and effectively utilize these critical investments and leverage the multiple sources of financing efficiently and at scale.

As part of the protest, people should form long queues at polling stations on 17 March at midday, Ms Navalnaya said. ""We need to use the election day to show that we exist and there are many of us,"" she said in a video message. Ms Navalnaya's husband died suddenly at a Russian penal colony on 16 February. She has blamed Mr Putin for his death. Her call for a polling day protest has been dubbed ""Midday against Putin"". Russia's presidential election - which most international observers do not believe will be free or fair - will take place from 15 to 17 March. Mr Putin is widely expected to win a fifth term in office. Ms Navalnaya said turning up at polling stations at the same time was a ""very simple and safe action"" that could not be prohibited by the authorities, but would allow like-minded people to ""see that there are many of us and we are strong"". People can then vote for any candidate except President Putin, spoil their ballot or write ""Navalny"" in big letters, Ms Navalnaya said. The idea of a midday gathering at polling stations was put forward by Navalny two weeks before his death. Navalny - who continued to keep up a social media presence from jail through messages posted by his lawyers - wrote on X that the election day protest had the chance to be a real ""all-Russian protest action... available to everyone, everywhere."" ""Millions will be able to take part in it. And tens of millions will witness it,"" Navalny wrote. Navalny himself was barred from running in the 2018 presidential vote because of an embezzlement conviction widely condemned as politically motivated. He died while serving a lengthy prison sentence on politically motivated charges. The Kremlin has said the 47-year-old died of natural causes, but his supporters and many foreign leaders have blamed Mr Putin for his fate. Ms Navalnaya stepped into the political spotlight soon after husband's death was announced, and has since addressed the European Parliament and held talks with US President Joe Biden. In her YouTube message, she spoke of being heartened by the large crowds that came out last week for her husband's funeral in Moscow. Since last Friday, thousands of people have continued to turn up to Borisovskoye Cemetery, and Navalny's grave has been submerged by flowers. ""I can't tell you how much that has meant to me,"" Ms Navalnaya said. ""Alexei dreamed of the beautiful Russia of the future - and that is you,"" she added.",CREDIBLE

What it means The separatist enclave sandwiched between Ukraine and Moldova has been in the headlines again since last week. This is due to a rare event — a “congress of deputies of all levels”, i.e. members of the so-called parliament, as well as district, city, town, and village councils of the self-proclaimed “Transnistria”. An extraordinary decision was expected at the “congress” — the seventh since the existence of this unrecognized country. The last time, in 2006, such a decision was a “referendum” on joining Russia (of course, not recognized by anyone). And now, as it was alleged, “Transnistrian deputies” may “ask” to join the Russian Federation and contribute to the crisis right next to Ukraine's borders. What happened in Tiraspol on February 28, why the “Congress of Deputies of Transnistria” did not end as dramatically as expected, and what else can be expected from Russia — find out in the article by hromadske. What is “Transnistria”? What is now referred to as “Transnistria” is the self-proclaimed “Transnistrian Moldovan Republic” (“TMR”), a strip of land along the left bank of the Dniester River between Ukraine and the rest of Moldova. The origins of the current “TMR” lie in the Soviet era, when the pseudo-state formed its own local elite, and its ethnic composition — approximately equal parts Moldovan, Russian, and Ukrainian — was markedly different from the rest of the Moldovan Soviet Socialist Republic. Another equally important factor was the 14th Soviet (later Russian) Army stationed in the “Transnistrian capital” of Tiraspol. In the late 1980s, the “perestroika” in the Soviet Union gave impetus to the declaration of independence by the republics dependent on it — the Moldavian SSR was no exception. At that time, the idea of unification with Romania was widespread among the Moldovan elite (their peoples have a long common history and a common language), which the Tiraspol elite was not satisfied with due to the aforementioned differences. In 1992, these differences escalated into a several-month war between Chişinău and Tiraspol, with the aforementioned 14th Russian Army on the latter's side. Eventually, in July of that year, the parties signed an agreement to resolve the conflict, in which Russia became a “mediator”. Since then, the Transnistrian conflict has been de facto frozen. A so-called security zone was created along the Dniester, where a joint “peacekeeping mission” of Russia and Moldova operates. The “5+2” negotiation format was established (parties to the conflict — Moldova and Transnistria; mediators — Ukraine, Russia, and the OSCE; observers — the United States and the EU), within which several never implemented settlement plans were put forward. And the Russian 14th Army continues to remain there despite its 1992 promises to withdraw from the “TMR”. How does Russia and the war affect “Transnistria”? During its separation from Moldova, “Transnistria” has acquired its own de facto authorities: it has its own “constitution”, its own “president” and “parliament”, even its own “currency”, the Transnistrian ruble, and its official languages are “Moldovan”, Ukrainian, and Russian. “Transnistria” was and is economically extremely dependent on Russia, or rather, on Russian gas, which was used by the enterprises there that were preserved from the Soviet era. And Chişinău has long been interested in this dependence, as it received free electricity generated at the Kuchurgan thermal power plant in the south of “Transnistria”. At the same time, the debt for gas from Moscow was recorded on Moldova, and only the current government has taken on both the dependence on “Transnistrian” electricity and the debt to Gazprom. Of course, Russian propaganda is strong in the “PMR”. The local population actually watches only Russian TV channels. It is not surprising that in 2006, “Transnistria” organized a “referendum” in which 97% of the population declared their desire to join the Russian Federation. But it is also not surprising that the results of an incomprehensible vote in a country that is not recognized by anyone (including Russia itself) have not been recognized by any country in the world. Since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, “Transnistria” has found itself in a difficult position. On the one hand, at the beginning of the active phase of the war, Russian troops in the “PMR” were seen as a potential threat to Ukraine. On the other hand, their number (exact figures are unknown, but the contingent probably does not exceed two thousand) and combat capability (outdated Soviet equipment, lack of experience) raise serious questions: what if the 14th Army is defeated and “Transnistria” will cease to exist? Therefore, the “Transnistrian” authorities resorted to provocations, such as unexplained explosions in April 2022, and banal propaganda about saboteurs being trained by Chişinău and Kyiv for sabotage against Tiraspol. The seventh “Congress of deputies of all levels of the Transnistrian Moldovan Republic” held on February 28, 2024, should be viewed in this light. What happened at the “Congress of Deputies of Transnistria”? The Congress had a formal and very specific reason. On January 1, Moldova abolished tax privileges for “Transnistrian” companies to equalize their rights with companies in the rest of Moldova. This is a logical step for a country that seeks peaceful reintegration. But for a region with a dead economy dependent on Russia, it is a painful blow. And last year, Moldova adopted amendments to the criminal code on liability for separatism and espionage, which Tiraspol presented as Chişinău's intention to imprison almost every Transnistrian (which is not true). There were expectations that the “Congress of Transnistrian deputies” would adopt an appeal to the Russian authorities to include the region in the Russian Federation. Given Tiraspol's dependence on the Kremlin, it cannot be ruled out that the scenario of asking for “joining Russia” was indeed a possibility. The final declaration of the “congress” indeed does not lack harsh and even openly pathetic wording such as “Moldova has actually unleashed an economic war against our people.” But in fact, it only decided to ask the Russian “parliament” to “implement diplomatic measures to protect ‘Transnistria’ in the face of Moldova's increasing pressure.” And also to ask international institutions to “influence the leadership of Moldova to return to an adequate dialogue and stop violations of the rights and freedoms of the inhabitants of ‘Transnistria’”. Why did the appeal turn out to be so streamlined? First, nothing has actually changed in “Transnistria” since 2006, when the “PMR” held a referendum on “joining Russia”. Formally speaking, the “congress” was not supposed to adopt any new request. But, interestingly, the declaration makes no mention of this “referendum” or indeed of the “PMR's” desire to be part of Russia in general. Secondly, even if “Transnistria” were to ask Russia to join again, this step would not make practical sense. After all, the enclave borders only Moldova and Ukraine, and Russian forces have no access to it, while the combat capability of the 14th Army already present in the region raises significant questions. Therefore, it is possible that in the event of a real military provocation by “Transnistria”, its reintegration with Moldova would be quickly completed with the help of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. How are people reacting to the “congress” and what can we expect next? Chişinău has consistently emphasized that it sees no reason for the escalation in unrecognized “Transnistria”. Moldova's Bureau for Reintegration, which is responsible for dialogue with Tiraspol, called the statement of the “Transnistrian deputies” about oppression “a propaganda declaration” and reminded that the Transnistrian region enjoys “the benefits of policies of peace, security and economic integration with the European Union, which are favorable for all citizens.” Moldovan President Maia Sanduwas more unequivocal, emphasizing Russia's role in spreading rumors about the “possible annexation of Transnistria”. “The Kremlin is doing this to intimidate Moldovans. Moreover, this is an election year. The Kremlin wants us to be scared, to be spineless, to be ruled by corrupt officials, and to be able to negotiate with them by bribing politicians, as has been the case for many years. We cannot allow them to do this. We must keep the peace,” thePresident said. Statements from the Ukrainian side also pointed to the Kremlin's interest in regional destabilization. For example, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine emphasized the unviability of the 5+2 format due to the presence of the aggressor state. “Ukraine continues to advocate for the earliest possible withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of the Transnistrian region of Moldova, the disposal of ammunition at the warehouses in Kovbasna, and the reformatting of the mission on the Dniester from a military to a civilian one,” the ministry added. Andrii Yusov, a representative of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine, was even more concise: “Today, given the situation in the ‘PMR’, nothing happened. Russia did not get the desired result. In this situation, their efforts, both political and informational, have been defeated.” As expected, the Western powers emphasized their support for Moldova's territorial integrity and sovereignty, and the European Unionplans to discuss additional aid for Chişinău in early March. The reaction of Russia is interesting. Rather, its stinginess. On February 28, the propaganda media also published a comment from an “interlocutor” in the Russian Foreign Ministry, who only said that “protecting the interests of the residents of ‘Transnistria’ is one of Russia's priorities” and “all requests are always carefully considered by relevant Russian authorities.” Another point is that the appeal of the “Congress of Deputies of Transnistria” should be addressed to the Russian parliament. “Should be” — because the declaration of the “congress” mentions only the intention to send such an appeal. As of March 1, it still does not exist. The fact that Tiraspol did not have time to prepare such a seemingly important address, for which it had to convene a “congress of deputies of all levels” for the first time in almost 18 years, is quite eloquent in itself. Vladimir Putin did not say a word about “Transnistria” in his address to the federal assembly on February 29, which was in fact the announcement of his election program. The theoretical explanation for Moscow's waiting is quite trivial: it has not given up the idea of bringing all of Moldova under its influence, as Maia Sandu said. The country will hold presidential elections in the fall of 2024, and parliamentary elections early next year. And there is reason to believe that the pro-European Sandu and her Action and Solidarity party will not win as convincingly as in previous elections. That is why the Kremlin is actively looking for someone who could play on the pro-Russian field as an opposition to the current government. So this time, another Russian-inspired escalation seems to have been avoided. But this does not mean that Russia has given up its attempts to arrange it. - Share:",CREDIBLE

News • Soviet Union, former northern Eurasian empire (1917/22–1991) stretching from the Baltic and Black seas to the Pacific Ocean and, in its final years, consisting of 15 Soviet Socialist Republics (S.S.R.’s): Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belorussia (now Belarus), Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kirgiziya (now Kyrgyzstan), Latvia, Lithuania, Moldavia (now Moldova), Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. The capital was Moscow, then and now the capital of Russia. During the period of its existence, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was by area the world’s largest country. It was also one of the most diverse, with more than 100 distinct nationalities living within its borders. The majority of the population, however, was made up of East Slavs (Russians, Ukrainians, and Belorussians); these groups together made up more than two-thirds of the total population in the late 1980s. At its greatest extent, between 1946 and 1991 (the figures and descriptions given below refer to this period), the U.S.S.R. covered some 8,650,000 square miles (22,400,000 square kilometres), seven times the area of India and two and one-half times that of the United States. The country occupied nearly one-sixth of the Earth’s land surface, including the eastern half of Europe and roughly the northern third of Asia. The U.S.S.R. extended more than 6,800 miles (10,900 kilometres) from east to west, covering 11 of the world’s 24 time zones. The most westerly point was on the Baltic Sea, near Kaliningrad; the easternmost was Cape Dezhnev on the Bering Strait, nearly halfway around the world. From north to south the U.S.S.R. extended some 2,800 miles from Cape Chelyuskin to Kushka on the Afghan border. Nearly half the territory of the U.S.S.R. was north of 60° N, at the same latitude as Alaska, Baffin Island, and Greenland. In addition to having the world’s longest coastline, the U.S.S.R. had the longest frontiers. To the north the country was bounded by the seas of the Arctic Ocean, and to the east were the seas of the Pacific. On the south the U.S.S.R. was bordered by North Korea, Mongolia, China, Afghanistan, Iran, and Turkey. On the southern frontier there were three seas: the Caspian Sea, the world’s largest inland sea, as well as the almost completely landlocked Black Sea and Sea of Azov. Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Finland, and Norway lay to the west. The U.S.S.R. was the successor to the Russian Empire of the tsars. Following the 1917 Revolution, four socialist republics were established on the territory of the former empire: the Russian and Transcaucasian Soviet Federated Socialist Republics and the Ukrainian and Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republics. On December 30, 1922, these constituent republics established the U.S.S.R. Additional union republics (Soviet Socialist Republics) were set up in subsequent years: the Turkmen and Uzbek S.S.R.’s in 1924, the Tadzhik S.S.R. in 1929, and the Kazakh and Kirgiz S.S.R.’s in 1936. In that year the Transcaucasian Republic was abolished and its territory was divided between three new republics: the Armenian, Azerbaijan, and Georgian S.S.R.’s. In 1940 the Karelo-Finnish, Moldavian, Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian S.S.R.’s were established. The Karelo-Finnish S.S.R. became an autonomous republic in 1956, leaving a total of 15 union republics (soyuznye respubliki). In addition to these, the U.S.S.R. as of 1990 was made up of 20 autonomous republics (avtonomnye respubliki), 8 autonomous provinces (avtonomnye oblasti), 10 autonomous districts (avtonomnye okruga), 6 regions (kraya), and 114 provinces (oblasti). Under the constitution adopted in the 1930s and modified down to October 1977, the political foundation of the U.S.S.R. was formed by the Soviets (Councils) of People’s Deputies. These existed at all levels of the administrative hierarchy, with the Soviet Union as a whole under the nominal control of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R., located in Moscow. This body had two chambers—the Soviet of the Union, with 750 members elected on a single-member constituency basis; and the Soviet of Nationalities, with 750 members representing the various political divisions: 32 from each union republic, 11 from each autonomous republic, 5 from each autonomous region, and 1 from each autonomous district. In elections to these bodies, the voters were rarely given any choice of candidate other than those presented by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), which, until the amendment of Article 6 of the constitution in March 1990, was the “leading and guiding force of Soviet society and the nucleus of its political system.” In theory, all legislation required the approval of both chambers of the Supreme Soviet; in practice, all decisions were made by the small group known as the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, itself strongly influenced by the Politburo of the CPSU, and were unanimously approved by the deputies. The role of the soviets in the individual republics and other territories was primarily to put into effect the decisions made by the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. The political system was thus authoritarian and highly centralized, and this also applied to the economic system. The economic foundation of the U.S.S.R. was “Socialist ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange,” and the economy of the entire country was controlled by a series of five-year plans that set targets for all forms of production. Dramatic changes, both political and economic, occurred during the late 1980s and early ’90s, ushered in by the adoption of perestroika (“restructuring”) and glasnost (“openness”). On the economic side the planned, highly centralized command economy was to be replaced by the progressive introduction of elements of a market economy, a change that proved difficult to achieve and was accompanied by declining production in many sectors and increasing distribution problems. In the political sphere, amendments to the constitution in 1988 replaced the old Supreme Soviet with the Congress of People’s Deputies of the U.S.S.R. The new congress had 2,250 members; one-third of these were elected on a constituency basis, one-third represented the political territories (as in the old Supreme Soviet), and the remaining third came from “all-union social organizations” such as the trade unions, the CPSU, and the Academy of Sciences. Voters were presented with a choice of candidates, and many non-Communists were elected. The Congress of People’s Deputies elected a new Supreme Soviet of 542 members and also chose the chairman of that body, who was to be the executive president of the U.S.S.R. Congresses of People’s Deputies were also established in each republic. These congresses could be legitimately described as parliaments, and they engaged in vigorous debate over the economic and political future of the country. From 1989, conflicts developed between the parliament of the U.S.S.R. and those of the individual republics, mainly over the respective powers of the centre (the U.S.S.R. government) and the republics. These conflicts were exacerbated by the resurgence of ethnic nationalism and increasing demands for autonomy and even for full independence. Following the abortive coup of August 1991, in which the CPSU was heavily implicated, the party itself was abolished. By December 1991 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics had virtually ceased to exist, and the future of its territories and peoples was uncertain. Three republics—Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania—had achieved complete independence and were internationally recognized as sovereign states, and several others were demanding independence. Attempts were made, led by Mikhail Gorbachev, the president of the Soviet Union, to establish a new “Union of Sovereign States” with some degree of integration in foreign policy, defense, and economic affairs, but agreement among the remaining 12 republics was not achieved. Whatever the legal position, the union republics had begun to act as if they were sovereign states and were negotiating with each other, bypassing the vestigial central government. This process culminated on December 8, 1991, in the signing of an agreement between the three Slav republics of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus for the establishment of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), with an agreed common policy for foreign affairs and defense. The CIS later came to include all the remaining republics except Georgia, but great difficulty was experienced in arriving at agreed policies. The future thus remained uncertain, but there could be no disagreement with the statement by the leaders of the Commonwealth that “the U.S.S.R. has ceased to exist as a geopolitical reality.” This article contains a history of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics from 1917 to 1991. For the geography and history of the former Soviet Socialist republics, see the articles Moldova, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Ukraine. The Russian Revolution Late tsarist Russia Sometime in the middle of the 19th century, Russia entered a phase of internal crisis that in 1917 would culminate in revolution. Its causes were not so much economic or social as political and cultural. For the sake of stability, tsarism insisted on rigid autocracy that effectively shut out the population from participation in government. At the same time, to maintain its status as a great power, it promoted industrial development and higher education, which were inherently dynamic. The result was perpetual tension between government and society, especially its educated element, known as the intelligentsia. Of the socioeconomic causes of tsarism’s ultimate collapse, the most important was rural overpopulation: tsarist Russia had the highest rate of demographic growth in Europe; in the second half of the 19th century the rural population increased by more than 50 percent. Potentially destabilizing also was the refusal of the mass of Russian peasantry, living in communes, to acknowledge the principle of private property in land. In the late 19th century the political conflict pitted three protagonists: tsarism, the peasantry (with the working class, its subdivision), and the intelligentsia. The tsar was absolute and unlimited in his authority, which was subject to neither constitutional restraints nor parliamentary institutions. He ruled with the help of a bureaucratic caste, subject to no external controls and above the law, and the army, one of whose main tasks was maintaining internal order. Imperial Russia developed to a greater extent than any contemporary country a powerful and ubiquitous security police. It was a crime to question the existing system or to organize for any purpose whatsoever without government permission. The system, which contained seeds of future totalitarianism, was nevertheless not rigidly enforced and was limited by the institution of private property. Some eighty percent of the empire’s population consisted of peasants. The vast majority of Russian peasants lived in communes (obshchiny), which held land in common and periodically redistributed it to member households to allow for changes in family size. The communal organization, composed of heads of households, exercised great control over members. Communal peasants did not own their land but merely cultivated it for a period of time determined by local custom. Under these conditions they had little opportunity to develop respect for private property or any of the other qualities necessary for citizenship. Politically they tended toward primitive anarchism. To some extent this also held true for industrial workers, some two million strong at the turn of the century, most of whom came from the village. The intelligentsia was partly liberal, partly radical, but in either case unalterably opposed to the status quo. Radical intellectuals tried in the 1860s and ’70s to stir the peasants and workers to rebellion. Having met with no response, they adopted methods of terror, which culminated in 1881 in the assassination of Emperor Alexander II. The government reacted with repressive measures that kept the revolutionaries at bay for the next two decades. In the meantime the field was left to liberal intellectuals, who in January 1904 formed the Union of Liberation, a semilegal political body committed to the struggle for democracy. The oppositional groups received their chance in 1904–05 when Russia became involved in a war with Japan. Caused by Russia’s designs on Manchuria, the war went badly from the start, lowering the regime’s prestige in the eyes of the people. The Union of Liberation, moving into the open, presented a program of fundamental political reforms. In January 1905, following the massacre of a worker demonstration bearing a petition drafted by the Union of Liberation (“Bloody Sunday”), the country exploded in rebellion, which, ebbing and flowing in response to news from the front, reached a climax in October 1905. On October 17 (October 30, New Style), faced with a general strike, Emperor Nicholas II issued a manifesto that promised the country a legislative parliament. The October Manifesto in effect ended the autocratic system. The following year Russia was given a constitution. Elections took place to a representative body, the State Duma, which was empowered to initiate and veto legislative proposals. The population received guarantees of fundamental civil liberties. Censorship was abolished. Between 1906 and 1911 Russia was administered by the greatest statesman of the late imperial era, Pyotr Stolypin. Stolypin both ruthlessly suppressed disorders and carried out extensive reforms. The most important of these were laws allowing peasants to withdraw from the commune and establish independent farmsteads. Stolypin hoped to create a self-reliant yeomanry to act as a stabilizing force in the countryside. He also had other social and political reforms in mind. These were frustrated by the hostility of the court as well as of the opposition parties. He was murdered by a revolutionary in 1911. The constitution of 1906 was frequently violated by both the government and the opposition. The former misused its emergency clauses to adjourn the Duma and rule by decree. The latter, especially the radical parties, sabotaged the legislative process. Even so, in its last decade Russia enjoyed greater freedom than ever before. It also enjoyed relative prosperity: on the eve of World War I it was the world’s leading producer of petroleum and exporter of grain. Conditions in the countryside gradually improved, and in 1916 peasants owned or rented 90 percent of the arable land. The February Revolution World War I weakened tsarism. The humiliating defeats that the Russian army suffered at the hands of the Germans, who expelled it from Poland, lowered the prestige of the monarchy further. There were also unsubstantiated rumours that Empress Alexandra, a German by origin, betrayed military secrets to the enemy. The opposition, instead of rallying behind the crown, exploited its difficulties to wrest further powers so as to be in a position to take charge once the war was over. The government, for its part, clung jealously to all its prerogatives, from fear that involving public figures in the war effort would make it impossible to reassert strong tsarist authority once peace was reestablished. In no other belligerent country were political conflicts waged as intensely during the war as in Russia, preventing the effective mobilization of the rear. One result of this was disorganization of food supplies. Although Russia produced more than enough to feed itself, economic mismanagement combined with the breakdown of transportation led in the third year of the war to a sharp rise in prices and to food shortages in the cities. The final assault on the monarchy began in November 1916, when the head of the liberal Constitutional Democratic Party, Pavel Milyukov, during a session of the Duma, implied the government was guilty of treason. During the exceptionally severe winter of 1916–17, food and fuel deliveries to the major cities, especially the capital, Petrograd (the name given to St. Petersburg between 1914 and 1924), continued to decline. Dissatisfaction with the government’s conduct of the war, coupled with economic hardships, led in late February 1917 (early March, New Style) to an outburst of popular fury. The revolt began with a mutiny of the Petrograd garrison, staffed by superannuated reservists; from them it spread to the industrial quarters. Nicholas II, persuaded by his generals that he and his wife were the main obstacle to victory, agreed to abdicate (March 2 [March 15, New Style]). Instead of improving Russia’s war effort, the abdication of the man who, however unqualified to rule, symbolized for the mass of the population the idea of statehood led to the rapid disintegration of the country. Authority was nominally assumed by a provisional government, issued from the Duma and headed by Prince Georgy Lvov. In fact, it was from the outset exercised by the Petrograd Soviet (“Council”), a body that claimed to represent the nation’s workers and soldiers but actually was convened and run by an executive committee of radical intellectuals nominated by the socialist parties. Similar soviets sprang up in other cities. In the summer of 1917, their socialist leaders united to form in Petrograd the All-Russian Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies. The All-Russian Soviet assumed responsibility for ensuring that the provisional government, which it labeled “bourgeois,” did not stray from the path of progress. It legislated on its own without bearing responsibility for the consequences. On March 1 (March 14, New Style), fearing a counterrevolution, the Soviet issued “Order No. 1,” which instructed the troops to disarm their officers. Its effect was to cause a breakdown of discipline in the armed forces. The regime of “dual power” quickly brought disarray to the country. In May representatives of the Petrograd Soviet entered the government, but this action did not stop the slide to anarchy as peasants seized land, soldiers deserted, and ethnic minorities clamored for self-rule. An offensive that the minister of war, Aleksandr Kerensky, launched on June 16 (June 29, New Style), 1917 in the hope of rallying patriotic spirits soon ran out of steam.",CREDIBLE

""You don't need to reduce welfare to reduce your climate impact,"" said Mattias Goldmann, founder of the Swedish 2030-secretariat, who works towards Sweden reaching its climate target for the national transport sector. Sweden outperforms all other European countries when it comes to reducing net greenhouse gas emissions, according to the European Environment Agency. The country already emitted five times less carbon dioxide, or CO2, per capita than the European average back in 1990. Since then, Sweden has reduced its net greenhouse gas emissions by another 80%, while the average reduction in the EU has only been 30%. What's most stunning, though, is that Sweden, a heavily industrialized country which produces steel, cement and cars, managed to clean up its act — while also growing its economy twofold. So how do you successfully decarbonize an economy while still growing it? Investing in clean energy sources The Scandinavian country has some natural advantages. 70% of Sweden is forest land. And forests are very useful when it comes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions because they remove CO2 from the atmosphere. The country is also blessed with a great deal of wind, as well as mountains, streams and lakes — perfect for renewable energy. But it wasn't just hitting the natural resources jackpot that got the country to where it is now. Sweden realized its natural potential early on and started investing in renewable energy sources much earlier than many other countries. ""Sweden has had hydropower for more than a century,"" according to Goldmann. They also cut out fossil fuels from their energy mix back in the 1970s, when the global oil crisis hit. When countries were looking for other sources of energy, Sweden substantially built out nuclear energy. Today, almost 70% of Sweden's electricity comes from renewables, especially hydropower and wind. The rest of its electricity demand is met by nuclear power. This means their greenhouse gas emissions for electricity production are almost zero right now. ""So, they are almost not using any fossil fuels for producing electricity. If you compare it with other countries, that's a whole other world,"" said Jorre De Schrijver, an energy expert from the European Environment Agency. Decarbonizing heat production And it's not just electricity that's now produced without fossil fuels in Sweden — that also goes for heating and energy-intense industrial processes. So, what was the trick there? The first step was that Sweden invested in district heating systems early on, which are more efficient. This means that instead of having a heater in each home, you build big, centralized heaters that are connected to many houses and industrial areas through insulated pipes and underground infrastructure. ""You need the government and the private sector to work together to provide this infrastructure,"" said Asa Persson, who advises the Swedish government on climate policy and rates its performance. It's also quite expensive — just think of all the piping you need to lay across entire neighborhoods. Nonetheless, the government decided to go for this approach early on and stuck with it. ""They saw the benefits of having these bigger system solutions. Sweden as a cold country had a real incentive to have a sort of energy efficient and sort of rational heating system in place to serve inhabitants,"" said Persson. The good thing about district heating is that you can shift the fuels that such a system uses. In the past, Sweden relied on fossil fuels like oil and coal. But since the 1990s, the country attached particular importance to the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency, investing in the use of energy, especially wood fuels. Today, 97% of the heating in Sweden comes from biofuels and burning waste. ""Sweden managed to reduce emissions from electricity and heating by 70% in the last 30 years. So that also shows that big, bold changes are possible,"" said Persson. Strong policies: giving people and businesses incentives And these big, bold changes didn't come out of thin air. Sweden has implemented clear climate policies since the 1990s, such as introducing one of the world's first — and by now one of the world's highest — carbon taxes, charging individuals for the carbon dioxide they emit. ""There's a clear message for us: either we do something that's bad for the environment and we have to pay the tax, or do we do something that's better and we're not taxed,"" said Goldmann. A 2019 empirical case study found that the Swedish carbon tax had a significant impact on CO2 emissions: it was responsible for a 6% decline of emissions from transport in an average year. And it sped up the changes in the energy and heating sector by giving people and businesses the incentive to invest in renewable energy instead of fossil fuels. While people many other countries would revolt against any new tax, acceptance in Sweden has been high. ""There has been support for environmental and climate policy for a long time in Sweden, and the country has also prided itself for being a leader in that regard,"" said Persson. This is true across the political spectrum. In Sweden, seven out of eight parties agreed back in 2017 on the world's most stringent climate target: to be net zero by 2045. ""It's a world leading target that gave business and citizens a strong belief that this is actually going to continue happening and that I can invest in it knowing that even with the change of government, it will still stand,"" said Goldmann. Setbacks due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine While Sweden has taken some major steps to slash emissions, not all sectors have been successfully decarbonized yet. Transport and agriculture are currently Sweden's largest sources of emissions. And it's especially the transport sector that's currently Sweden's biggest problem child. Following the energy crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Sweden's conservative government rolled back some important policies. It lowered petrol and diesel taxes by a quarter, which means Sweden now has among the lowest prices on diesel and gasoline in Europe. It also introduced other measures that make it less expensive to drive a car to support struggling households, while abolishing incentives that were previously offered to buy electric vehicles. ""We are increasing emissions by roughly 5 million tons of carbon dioxide per year. In fact, this is the biggest increase in transport emissions in the history of Sweden,"" said Goldmann. But he believes it's just a momentary setback as the government promised that these new measures will only be short-term, and that Sweden is still on track to meet its targets for the transport sector again: a reduction of 70% of emissions between 2010 and 2030. Lessons learned So what lessons can other countries learn from the Swedish success story? ""Sweden, I think, illustrates that yes, it's indeed possible to produce electricity without any greenhouse gas emissions at all, and that's an example for other countries in the world,"" said energy expert De Schrijver from the European Environment Agency. Can Sweden's approach serve as a blueprint for other countries? ""Find where your main climate impact is and where you can make the biggest difference. Find what is your sort of unique selling point as a country, where is your entry point, and build on that,"" said Goldmann. ""That will give you the green businesses, the green jobs, the billions in export income that you can use for other things that you want, better welfare, better schooling, and so forth,"" he added. He says that while the situation was different in each country, it was very important to include everyone in the transition. Persson agrees. ""The biggest lesson is that you need close cooperation between government, private sector, and the local government as well to really develop these system solutions together and take risks, make these big long-term investments. That has been a success factor behind Sweden's decarbonization,"" she said. Edited by: Sarah Steffen",CREDIBLE

News • World War II, conflict that involved virtually every part of the world during the years 1939–45. The principal belligerents were the Axis powers—Germany, Italy, and Japan—and the Allies—France, Great Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and, to a lesser extent, China. The war was in many respects a continuation, after an uneasy 20-year hiatus, of the disputes left unsettled by World War I. The 40,000,000–50,000,000 deaths incurred in World War II make it the bloodiest conflict, as well as the largest war, in history. Along with World War I, World War II was one of the great watersheds of 20th-century geopolitical history. It resulted in the extension of the Soviet Union’s power to nations of eastern Europe, enabled a communist movement to eventually achieve power in China, and marked the decisive shift of power in the world away from the states of western Europe and toward the United States and the Soviet Union. (Read Sir John Keegan’s Britannica entry on the Normandy Invasion.) Axis initiative and Allied reaction The outbreak of war By the early part of 1939 the German dictator Adolf Hitler had become determined to invade and occupy Poland. Poland, for its part, had guarantees of French and British military support should it be attacked by Germany. Hitler intended to invade Poland anyway, but first he had to neutralize the possibility that the Soviet Union would resist the invasion of its western neighbour. Secret negotiations led on August 23–24 to the signing of the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact in Moscow. In a secret protocol of this pact, the Germans and the Soviets agreed that Poland should be divided between them, with the western third of the country going to Germany and the eastern two-thirds being taken over by the U.S.S.R. Having achieved this cynical agreement, the other provisions of which stupefied Europe even without divulgence of the secret protocol, Hitler thought that Germany could attack Poland with no danger of Soviet or British intervention and gave orders for the invasion to start on August 26. News of the signing, on August 25, of a formal treaty of mutual assistance between Great Britain and Poland (to supersede a previous though temporary agreement) caused him to postpone the start of hostilities for a few days. He was still determined, however, to ignore the diplomatic efforts of the western powers to restrain him. Finally, at 12:40 pm on August 31, 1939, Hitler ordered hostilities against Poland to start at 4:45 the next morning. The invasion began as ordered. In response, Great Britain and France declared war on Germany on September 3, at 11:00 am and at 5:00 pm, respectively. World War II had begun. Forces and resources of the European combatants, 1939 In September 1939 the Allies, namely Great Britain, France, and Poland, were together superior in industrial resources, population, and military manpower, but the German military, or Wehrmacht, because of its armament, training, doctrine, discipline, and fighting spirit, was the most efficient and effective fighting force for its size in the world. The index of military strength in September 1939 was the number of divisions that each nation could mobilize. Against Germany’s 100 infantry divisions and six armoured divisions, France had 90 infantry divisions in metropolitan France, Great Britain had 10 infantry divisions, and Poland had 30 infantry divisions, 12 cavalry brigades, and one armoured brigade (Poland had also 30 reserve infantry divisions, but these could not be mobilized quickly). A division contained from 12,000 to 25,000 men. It was the qualitative superiority of the German infantry divisions and the number of their armoured divisions that made the difference in 1939. The firepower of a German infantry division far exceeded that of a French, British, or Polish division; the standard German division included 442 machine guns, 135 mortars, 72 antitank guns, and 24 howitzers. Allied divisions had a firepower only slightly greater than that of World War I. Germany had six armoured divisions in September 1939; the Allies, though they had a large number of tanks, had no armoured divisions at that time. The six armoured, or panzer, divisions of the Wehrmacht comprised some 2,400 tanks. And though Germany would subsequently expand its tank forces during the first years of the war, it was not the number of tanks that Germany had (the Allies had almost as many in September 1939) but the fact of their being organized into divisions and operated as such that was to prove decisive. In accordance with the doctrines of General Heinz Guderian, the German tanks were used in massed formations in conjunction with motorized artillery to punch holes in the enemy line and to isolate segments of the enemy, which were then surrounded and captured by motorized German infantry divisions while the tanks ranged forward to repeat the process: deep drives into enemy territory by panzer divisions were thus followed by mechanized infantry and foot soldiers. These tactics were supported by dive bombers that attacked and disrupted the enemy’s supply and communications lines and spread panic and confusion in its rear, thus further paralyzing its defensive capabilities. Mechanization was the key to the German blitzkrieg, or “lightning war,” so named because of the unprecedented speed and mobility that were its salient characteristics. Tested and well-trained in maneuvers, the German panzer divisions constituted a force with no equal in Europe. The German Air Force, or Luftwaffe, was also the best force of its kind in 1939. It was a ground-cooperation force designed to support the Army, but its planes were superior to nearly all Allied types. In the rearmament period from 1935 to 1939 the production of German combat aircraft steadily mounted. The table shows the production of German aircraft by years. | year | combat types | other types | |---|---|---| | 1933 | 0 | 368 | | 1934 | 840 | 1,128 | | 1935 | 1,823 | 1,360 | | 1936 | 2,530 | 2,582 | | 1937 | 2,651 | 2,955 | | 1938 | 3,350 | 1,885 | | 1939 | 4,733 | 3,562 | The standardization of engines and airframes gave the Luftwaffe an advantage over its opponents. Germany had an operational force of 1,000 fighters and 1,050 bombers in September 1939. The Allies actually had more planes in 1939 than Germany did, but their strength was made up of many different types, some of them obsolescent. The corresponding table shows the number of first-line military aircraft available to the Allies at the outbreak of war. | aircraft | British | French | Polish | |---|---|---|---| | bombers | 536 | 463 | 200 | | fighters | 608 | 634 | 300 | | reconnaissance | 96 | 444 | — | | coastal command | 216 | — | — | | fleet air arm | 204 | 194 | — | Great Britain, which was held back by delays in the rearmament program, was producing one modern fighter in 1939, the Hurricane. A higher-performance fighter, the Spitfire, was just coming into production and did not enter the air war in numbers until 1940. The value of the French Air Force in 1939 was reduced by the number of obsolescent planes in its order of battle: 131 of the 634 fighters and nearly all of the 463 bombers. France was desperately trying to buy high-performance aircraft in the United States in 1939. At sea the odds against Germany were much greater in September 1939 than in August 1914, since the Allies in 1939 had many more large surface warships than Germany had. At sea, however, there was to be no clash between the Allied and the German massed fleets but only the individual operation of German pocket battleships and commerce raiders. Technology of war, 1918–39 When World War I ended, the experience of it seemed to vindicate the power of the defensive over the offensive. It was widely believed that a superiority in numbers of at least three to one was required for a successful offensive. Defensive concepts underlay the construction of the Maginot Line between France and Germany and of its lesser counterpart, the Siegfried Line, in the interwar years. Yet by 1918 both of the requirements for the supremacy of the offensive were at hand: tanks and planes. The battles of Cambrai (1917) and Amiens (1918) had proved that when tanks were used in masses, with surprise, and on firm and open terrain, it was possible to break through any trench system. The Germans learned this crucial, though subtle, lesson from World War I. The Allies on the other hand felt that their victory confirmed their methods, weapons, and leadership, and in the interwar period the French and British armies were slow to introduce new weapons, methods, and doctrines. Consequently, in 1939 the British Army did not have a single armoured division, and the French tanks were distributed in small packets throughout the infantry divisions. The Germans, by contrast, began to develop large tank formations on an effective basis after their rearmament program began in 1935. In the air the technology of war had also changed radically between 1918 and 1939. Military aircraft had increased in size, speed, and range, and for operations at sea, aircraft carriers were developed that were capable of accompanying the fastest surface ships. Among the new types of planes developed was the dive bomber, a plane designed for accurate low-altitude bombing of enemy strong points as part of the tank-plane-infantry combination. Fast low-wing monoplane fighters were developed in all countries; these aircraft were essentially flying platforms for eight to 12 machine guns installed in the wings. Light and medium bombers were also developed that could be used for the strategic bombardment of cities and military strongpoints. The threat of bomber attacks on both military and civilian targets led directly to the development of radar in England. Radar made it possible to determine the location, the distance, and the height and speed of a distant aircraft no matter what the weather was. By December 1938 there were five radar stations established on the coast of England, and 15 additional stations were begun. So, when war came in September 1939, Great Britain had a warning chain of radar stations that could tell when hostile planes were approaching.",CREDIBLE

The Russian occupation of Crimea started on February 20, 2014. Backed by the false claims about the return of the “ancestral Russian land,” it became the first step in the Russian plan to take over Ukraine. Why did Russia invade Crimea? The question of “why Russia wants Crimea” is inseparable from the question “why Russia invaded Ukraine” as a whole. Even in the 21st century, Russia has not dropped its imperialistic ambitions; it sees Ukraine, and Crimea in particular, as an integral part of “Mother Russia”. The aggressor state uses military force to reverse what it considers the “historical mistakes”: Ukrainian independence in its internationally recognized borders. Despite what Russia claims, Crimea has never been its “ancestral Russian land”: the Crimean Khanate became part of the Russian Empire (and ceased to exist) after a series of wars in 1783. The peninsula holds significant importance in terms of access to the Black Sea and the Azov Sea, as well as control over those waters. Therefore, Russia has been trying to hold on to Crimea and closely integrate it ever since. The Crimean Peninsula is the historical homeland of three indigenous people: Crimean Karaites, Krymchaks, and Crimean Tatars or Qırımlılar. Crimean Tatars, in particular, are the largest group of indigenous people on the peninsula and have a long history of statehood. When the Russian Empire annexed Crimea in the 18th century, the indigenous population dropped from 90% to around 29%. In 1944, USSR unlawfully deported almost all Crimean Tatars from Crimea and forbade them to move back. They were able to return home only almost 50 years later as the Soviet Union collapsed. Russian occupation in 2014 once again forced hundreds of thousands of people, Crimea Tatars and Ukrainians, to flee their homes. In each case, Russians moved to the peninsula instead, drastically changing the demographic – and later relying on it to strengthen their claim over the Crimea. When did Russia invade Crimea? February 20, 2014, is the official date of the beginning of the Russian occupation of Crimea. In the final days of the Revolution of Dignity, the Russian plan to take control of the Crimean Peninsula was put into motion. Russia had been concentrating troops near the region beforehand, in particular, under the pretext of military exercise, as well as guarding the Winter Olympics in Sochi. Some Russian forces have already been stationed in Crimea as the Russian Black Sea Fleet never left the peninsular, even as Ukraine regained independence in 1991. The open phase of the Russian occupation of Crimea began on February 27, when the Russian military without any insignia seized administrative buildings, blocked Ukrainian military units, and turned off Ukrainian television and radio. How did Russia take Crimea? At gunpoint of Russian servicemen, the Verkhovna Rada (parliament) of Crimea “voted” for the so-called “referendum on the status of Crimea”. It was held with numerous violations and falsifications under the total control of the many armed Russian soldiers on March 16, and just two days later, Vladimir Putin and representatives of the Russian occupation administration in Crimea signed the so-called Treaty on the Accession of Crimea to Russia. On March 25, 2014, the Russians captured the last military unit holding the Ukrainian flag in Crimea, a Cherkasy Navy minesweeper. The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation entirely occupied the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol. Why “annexation of Сrimea” may not be the right term? Annexation may be defined as a formal act: a state’s claim over a taken territory is made effective by actual possession and legitimized by general recognition. In the case of Crimea, annexation implies its inevitable accession to Russia. However, Russian claims over the peninsula have never been ever close to wide international acceptance. The UN General Assembly, PACE, OSCE PA, and most countries, including the United States and the EU members, consider Crimea a part of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders. What Russia has been doing for 10 years now is an occupation. A forceful and a temporary one. Amidst the full-scale war, Ukrainians are fighting to liberate every part of the country from the horror that the Russian invasion brought. Even under the occupation: more than 500 people in Crimea have been persecuted by the Russian occupational administration for their actions against Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. Several underground movements now operate there, spreading leaflets about Russia’s war crimes and helping the Armed Forces of Ukraine with information. Crimea will be liberated from Russia: it is an integral part of protecting the people, restoring international security, and establishing a long-lasting peace. And that is what Ukraine is fighting for.",CREDIBLE

In his speech commemorating the anniversary, Putin said that ""the regime in Kyiv exalts Hitler's accomplices, the SS men."" Moscow has repeatedly tried to justify its war on Ukraine as an effort to ""de-Nazify"" its southern neighbor, even though Ukraine has a democratically elected Jewish president who lost relatives in the Holocaust. Ukraine was once part of the Soviet Union and itself suffered devastation at the hands of Hitler's forces. It rejects the comparisons as spurious pretexts for a war of conquest. St. Petersburg, which during World War II was called Leningrad, marked its 80th anniversary of the end of a nearly 900-day siege by Nazi forces. The Red Army broke the blockade of the city on January 19, 1943, after more than 1 million residents died from hunger or under bombardment. The Soviet Union lost an estimated 27 million people during World War II. During his speech, Putin also excoriated Europe for ""Russophobia"" and criticized the Baltic States over human rights violations. ""In a number of European countries, Russophobia is promoted as state policy…in the Baltic states, tens of thousands of people are declared subhuman, deprived of their most basic rights, and subjected to persecution,"" Putin asserted, referring to migration crackdowns. Moscow has repeatedly accused the Baltic nations of xenophobia and of mistreating Russian minorities. Russia takes 'strategically insignificant' hamlets Russia has seized two Ukrainian hamlets this month, the British Defense Ministry said Saturday, in its daily Ukraine intelligence update. Neither, it said, is ""strategically insignificant."" Vesele, a small village near Bakhmut, had a pre-war population of 102, and Krokhmalne, near Kharkiv, had only 45 residents. Russia's capturing of the hamlets ""represents a continuation of Russia's minor, incremental gains,"" the ministry said, while Ukraine continues to focus on ""active defense."" The ministry also did not hold out hope that Russia's strategy for capturing the Ukrainian town of Avdiivka would work. Because Russia has suffered such heavy personnel and armored vehicle losses against Ukraine, the Russian troops will attempt to enter Avdiivka through service tunnels, a plan designed to cut down on drone attacks from Ukraine. However, Russia has been attempting to infiltrate Avdiivka via the tunnels since October, the ministry said. ""Avdiivka is likely to remain in Ukrainian control over the coming weeks,"" it predicted. No evidence POWs on plane, says Ukraine Officials in Ukraine say Russia has provided no credible evidence to support its claims that Ukrainian forces shot down a military transport plane allegedly carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war, who were to be swapped for Russian POWs. Ukraine's coordination staff for the treatment of prisoners of war said relatives of the named POWs were unable to identify their loved ones in crash site photos provided by Russian authorities. The head of Ukraine's military intelligence service also said Friday that Kyiv did not provide verifiable information about the passengers aboard the Russian airplane that was downed on Russian soil. Lieutenant Colonel Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine's military intelligence chief, made the comments after Russia's investigative committee posted online a video of what it described as Ukrainian prisoners of war boarding the plane that later crashed. The video on the committee's Telegram channel shows vehicles approaching an Ilyushin IL-76 aircraft on a snowy airfield. Individuals are seen getting out of the vehicles in preparation for boarding. The video has no sound and is accompanied only by a single line of explanation that it depicts Ukrainian servicemen boarding the military transport. It gives no location. Moscow says nine Russians also died in the crash. During his first remarks on the crash Friday, Putin blamed Ukraine for downing of the plane without providing proof for its accusations. ""I don't know if they did it on purpose or by mistake, but it is obvious that they did it,"" Putin said. ""In any case, what happened is a crime. Either through negligence or on purpose, but in any case, it is a crime."" Putin said in televised remarks. Putin said the plane could not have been brought down by Russian ""friendly fire"" because Russia's air defense systems have safeguards to prevent them from attacking their own planes. Russia's state investigative committee said Friday it had recovered Ukrainian identity documents and tattooed body parts from the crash site for genetic testing. It said the evidence collected also included ""documents of Ukrainian servicemen who died in the disaster, confirming their identities, as well as accompanying documents from the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia."" Russia has sole access to the crash site, and independent news organizations are unable to verify its account or examine the evidence that has been recovered. Ukraine disputes Russia's assertion that it had been forewarned that a plane carrying Ukrainian prisoners of war would be flying over Russia's southwestern Belgorod region at that time. At the United Nations Security Council, a Ukrainian envoy repeated her government's call for an international investigation, saying the Russian military did not allow emergency workers access to the crash site. Some material for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.",CREDIBLE
https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/moldovas-authorities-falsified-results-about-the-eu-referendum/,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23kdjxxx1jo,2024-10-19,"Russian cash-for-votes flows into Moldova as nation heads to polls The sniffer dogs at Chisinau Airport have been working extra hard in recent months, searching for money that might be evidence of Russian meddling in Moldovan politics. Ami, a black retriever, gives every suitcase that rolls in on the baggage claim belts a good sniff on all sides. If she detects cash, she will freeze. Back in May she was doing that a lot. That is when customs officers began finding large amounts of money on passengers arriving via connecting flights from Moscow. People who had never left Moldova before were returning from a few days in Russia with wads of notes. “Almost everyone had money: 2,000, 3,000, 7,000 euros”, the head of customs at Chisinau Airport, Ruslan Alexandrov, remembers. The amounts themselves were not illegal but the patterns were suspicious. “There were certain flights: Moscow-Istanbul-Chisinau, Moscow-Yerevan-Chisinau,” the customs chief explains. “Normally people don’t come in with that much money. Not from Moscow.” So police and prosecutors began seizing the cash. In one day alone they say they scooped $1.5m (£1.2m). No-one ever asked for their money back. The authorities believe the cash mules were part of a major and ongoing operation to buy political influence run by a fugitive Moldovan oligarch named Ilan Shor. Convicted of major fraud in Chisinau, he is now resident in Russia which will not extradite him. Ahead of two key votes this weekend, the capital’s airport is on alert. Flights from all ""high risk"" routes are met by sniffer dogs and at least half the passengers are pulled over for extra baggage scans. On Sunday, President Maia Sandu is running for re-election on a staunchly pro-EU platform, challenged by 10 other candidates. Many are openly sympathetic to Moscow; some see Moldova as a ""bridge"". Voters will also get to cast their ballot in a referendum on whether to enshrine Moldova’s goal of EU accession in the constitution. In fact, membership talks have already begun but the country has been in a battle over its political direction for decades, ever since Moldova gained independence from Moscow as the Soviet Union fell apart. That East-West tug has intensified since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. President Sandu – a former World Bank economist first elected on a promise to clean up corruption – then steered Moldova much more sharply towards the West. She began to openly identify Vladimir Putin’s Russia as a major security threat. The Kremlin denies playing any role in Chisinau politics, but officials here accuse Russia of operating via proxies to disrupt and destabilise the country. “I’m not aware of anywhere else where we’ve seen such a brazen and open attempt to corrupt an election,” Moldova’s chief anti-corruption prosecutor, Veronica Dragalin, told me this week in her office in Chisinau. Born in Moldova, she spent most of her life in the US – most recently as a prosecutor in Los Angeles – before returning to the country and a job in a small office on the fifth floor of a Soviet-era block with a broken lift. What her team say they have uncovered, working with police, is a pyramid payments scheme openly run from Russia by Ilan Shor and his group. “We’re talking about a foreign country sending money in an attempt to influence the election,” Ms Dragalin spells it out. She details evidence gained through wiretaps, police infiltrators and witnesses – some of which her office has made public. “At the start they tried to make it look legitimate. Now it’s almost like they’re flagrantly flaunting all the laws… [and] openly influencing the decision to vote,” the prosecutor says. “The primary goal is to have the referendum fail.” According to her team, once the cash couriers were detected at the airport and that route made more difficult, payments began to be channelled via a sanctioned Russian bank, PSB. By early October as many as 130,000 voters had received payment through this scheme - about 10% of the active electorate, according to Viorel Cernauteanu, the chief of police. “In September alone, $15m (£12m) was transferred,” he told me, explaining how they could trace funds and recipients because they gave personal data to open a bank account. Offering money or goods in return for votes is a crime with a possible five-year jail sentence. Last month, a new law made it an administrative offence to accept money, too. But in one of Europe’s poorest countries it is not hard to find willing recipients of cash. Moldovan investigators admit they cannot identify the source of funds paid into PSB bank – whether it is Russian state money, private capital or the cash Ilan Shor was convicted of stealing in Moldova. But he himself is very open about his actions and aims. In a typical recent post on TikTok, Shor called for a “firm NO” to the EU. He then urged followers to choose “the president I decide on, as someone I can work with”. In return he promised monthly top-up payments of 5,000 Moldovan lei to pensioners, or about £200. Shor fled Moldova in 2019 and was later sentenced in absentia for money laundering and embezzlement. Last year, his party was banned and he is also under Western sanctions, accused of ""malign influence campaigns"" for Russia. Media companies linked to him, Telegram channels and various political groupings have all been blocked. But his message – anti-EU, sympathetic to Moscow – still seeps through. Some remain receptive to that, as well as the cash. Ilya Uzun is one big fan. The deputy governor of Gagauzia, a small autonomous region of southern Moldova, also happens to respect Russian President Vladimir Putin. He tells me that is because he likes strong leaders who he thinks ""put their country first"". Russia’s war on neighbouring Ukraine changed nothing on that score. He admires former US President Donald Trump for the same reason, whilst his scorn for the EU – which recently placed him under sanctions for ""destabilising activities"" – mainly focuses on LGBT rights, which he opposes virulently. Later, when I ask passers-by in the regional capital Comrat about the EU referendum, several reply that they’ll vote ""no"" in order to keep ""gay parades"" from their town. Pro-Russian views and Kremlin-led narratives have always been strong in Gagauzia, where many still watch Russian state TV channels despite a national ban. Lately, Shor has been investing heavily here. The deputy governor repeatedly refers to him as “our political leader” and shrugs off the criminal conviction as if it were political. “Try and say a bad word here about Ilan Shor and people will spit at you!”, Uzun declares as we drive down Lenin Street past a statue of the Russian revolutionary, a little grubby but still intact. Many shop signs, those not in the local Gagauz language, are in Russian. I hear how Shor pays top-up pensions to 30,000 people in the region as well as re-tarmacking some 50 km (31 miles) of roads between remote villages, which we see. “All he does is for the people,” Uzun enthuses. The anti-corruption prosecutor later clarifies that using donations for social spending is not a crime. But channelling Shor’s funds to political parties is an offence – and Uzun’s boss, regional governor Evghenia Gutul, has been charged with that. After a while we roll up to a children’s fairground. “Look at Gagauziyaland, it’s beautiful!” Uzun beams, leading the way beneath a giant rainbow into a deserted but brand-new park. The wind is bitterly cold and the mini dragon roller-coaster and merry-go-round we are looking at both stand empty and still. But Uzun insists people in Gagauzia will vote “how Shor tells them” - not for money, but because they trust him. “All the talk, that he’s an arm of the Kremlin, destabilising Moldova: that’s absolutely not true. This is the truth: what you see here,” he waves towards the frozen fairground. On Friday, Moldova’s election campaign reached its climax. Maia Sandu was met for her own final rally in the small town of Telenesti, where women in traditional dress sang and supporters clapped as she passed. She has not taken part in election debates and did not want to speak to the BBC. But addressing a couple of hundred people through a microphone, Sandu urged Moldovans to vote for her and for the EU as the best path to peace. “This has been a very difficult campaign with a lot of lies and dirty money,” she told them, asking voters to “put our country out of harm’s way” and prevent her opponents “derailing Moldova from its European path”. That path has been a bumpy one for many years, with multiple diversions. Still, Moldova had already made its choice and opened accession talks with the EU. Now a referendum that Sandu initiated in an attempt to reinforce that goal and bolster her own support has turned into a risky political move. It looks like the presidential ballot is not the only vote she has to worry about on Sunday.",CREDIBLE

A Cold French Shower On All The De-Dollarization Hysteria Sure, financial instability in the U.S. and the weaponization of the dollar have raised crucial questions about how long the dollar can remain the world's de-facto currency. But France's leading business daily says don't expect major changes any time soon. PARIS — Americans are a strange bunch. Fifteen years after allowing the eruption of the largest global financial crisis in nearly a century, they were not even able to prevent a bank with more than $200 billion in assets from collapsing in a few hours. These people are as careless with their public accounts as they are with their private finances. This year, the U.S. public deficit is expected to approach 6% of GDP, almost double that of the European Union. As if this impasse were only a minor problem. Can we continue to trust a country's currency so inconsistent with money? More and more countries are answering this question by buying gold. After beginning their return to the yellow metal in 2009, just after the great financial crisis, central banks acquired 1,136 tons last year. A record for over half a century! And if they have increased their purchases, especially in emerging countries, it is not only to protect their reserves from inflation or banking crises. It may also be with monetary plans in mind. For the power of the dollar is increasingly difficult to bear. The United States has turned it into a weapon. Currency as a weapon For three decades, the currency has become a lever by which Washington imposes on other countries the respect of rules decided by the Americans alone. Like the embargo on Iran, following which the American authorities have severely condemned European firms that have continued transactions with Tehran via dollars (in 2014, BNP Paribas had to pay a fine of $9 billion). Last year, the weaponization of finance took a new step. Following the invasion of Ukraine, the United States and Europe decided on unprecedented sanctions that affected not only the assets of the Russian Central Bank, but also the means of payment. ""The patent abuse of the role of the dollar as a global reserve currency will weaken it,"" retorted Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Beyond Russia, the sanctions have caused a shock in many emerging countries, starting with China. If the United States can block a financial system with its Western allies, another financial system must be set up! Indonesian President Joko Widodo, for example, has recommended that local governments do without Visa and MasterCard. The focus is on the dollar, both a tool and a symbol of U.S. financial dominance. Plans to pay for commodities in other currencies have been accelerated. India now pays for Russian barrels in rupees. China is multiplying agreements to pay for its purchases in yuan (nickel in Russia, oil in Iraq) and to facilitate currency exchanges (Brazil, Argentina). It could also use its digital central bank currency as a monetary spearhead. Brazil and Argentina dream of a common currency. However, it is too early to talk about the de-dollarization of the world. The power of a currency cannot be decreed. It is built over years and even decades, by inspiring confidence in traders and investors. For this to happen, a solid economy, liquid and open financial markets, and credible regulations are needed. The dollar replaced the pound as the world's currency in the 1920s because the U.S. economy was thriving while the U.K. economy was weakened by the war. The Bretton Woods Agreement, signed 20 years later, only formalized the dollar's dominance. A Chinese leap forward And for now, the dollar remains at the heart of world finance. This is true in trade. It is involved in 88% of foreign exchange transactions, well ahead of the euro, which is at 31% (in these 2022 figures from the Bank for International Settlements, the sum is equal to 200% because each transaction involves two currencies). Transactions involving the yuan have jumped by a whopping 70% in three years... but they represent barely 7% of the total. This is also true for the other major function of money — reserve instruments. Nearly 60% of the world's foreign exchange reserves, which amount to some $11 trillion, are still denominated in U.S. currency. China has held fewer U.S. Treasury bonds than at any time in the past 15 years, but it appears to be replacing some of them with US-issued real estate-backed bonds, purchased via Belgium or Luxembourg. The de-dollarization will inevitably take place one day. But it will not happen any time soon. A Cold French Shower On All The De-Dollarization Hysteria Sure, financial instability in the U.S. and the weaponization of the dollar have raised crucial questions about how long the dollar can remain the world's de-facto currency. But France's leading business daily says don't expect major changes any time soon. PARIS — Americans are a strange bunch.

Is this a total disaster or can children adapt to the new media? For Die Zeit, Wenke Husmann takes a closer look at what scientists say about how screens influence the development of children's brains. *BERLIN — Every parent I know occasionally lets their child use their cell phone or tablet, even if they are under the age of 3. And they all have a guilty conscience. But as a parent, you also want to comb out your child's knotted hair or finish eating in peace. Besides, we live in the digital age, where screens are everywhere anyway. Just a few minutes surely can't be that bad. Or can they? This “or can they?” also concerns scientists. Researchers are looking into the physical, cognitive and social consequences of 0- to 3-year-olds using smartphones or tablets on their own. Their initial findings are worrying. For the latest news & views from every corner of the world, Worldcrunch Today is the only truly international newsletter. Sign up here. The more time a two-year-old spends in front of a screen, the higher their body mass index (BMI). Researchers in Sydney, for example, measured this back in 2014, with their young test participants spending an average of almost five hours a week in front of a screen. The health problem: an elevated BMI is a risk factor for developing Type 2 diabetes. Worldwide, myopia (nearsightedness) is the eye disease with the fastest-growing rate of affected individuals. Prolonged staring — such as at a screen — is considered a significant cause, especially at an age before the eyeballs are fully grown. That means at an age younger than 4 years. While children also stare when reading books, 2-year-olds don't do that yet. Children who use screens also sleep worse, and sleep plays a crucial role in learning. If its quality decreases, the brain cannot develop optimally and performs less effectively — resulting in children processing and memorizing experiences or learned information less efficiently. Poorer brain performance Last year, a research group from Singapore illustrated the development of children's brains in relation to screen use through electroencephalograms: Children who did not use digital media as babies and toddlers were ahead in brain activity compared to peers who spent a lot of time — up to several hours daily — in front of screens. The researchers found this developmental delay not only during toddlerhood. They demonstrated it both at 18 months of age and much later, at school age around 9 years old. The more a toddler engages with a screen, the less they crawl, kick and turn. The more a toddler engages with a screen, the less they crawl, kick and turn. Later, they also climb, balance and jump less often, simply because digital media rob time for such activities. As a parent, one might say: So the child learns to walk, hop and climb a few weeks later, where's the problem? But brain research shows that walking, hopping and climbing don't only train balance and body awareness, but also activate areas in the brain responsible for cognitive tasks like understanding, remembering and speaking. This connection can also be tested: Children with poorer gross motor development also achieve poorer results in cognitive tests. 2D vs 3D As a parent, you might wonder how this can be. Why should it be harmful for a child to watch animal videos, for example? If they're well-made, aren't they perhaps even educational? David Martin, a pediatrician at Witten/Herdecke University, has been studying the consequences of screen media use for children under three for years. During a video call, he illustrates the problem: ""Even if I only see you on the screen, I know that the dark area on your head is hair and how it would feel if I touched it. I know that the window sill behind you continues, even though I only see it to your right and left. I know that the blue rectangle at the very top is the sky. I know all this because I have acquired this world knowledge in the three-dimensional world."" A toddler has to learn this first — and that doesn't happen in two dimensions. The phenomenon has been known since the 1970s and is now referred to as the Video Deficit Effect. Research teams have repeatedly observed 2-year-olds watching an adult hide a toy in a room in experiments with slightly modified test procedures. Children literally have to grasp the world first. One group of test children observes the process directly in the same room, the other only via a screen. Children in the first group are then able to find the toy, while children in the second group are not. They cannot make the transfer from two to three dimensions. This starts working from about 3 years of age. ""Children literally have to grasp the world first for the brain to comprehend it,"" Martin says. Screens are unsuitable for this. According to Martin, the consequences are ""catastrophic."" What this catastrophe looks like can be seen in images of healthy preschoolers' brains taken by U.S. researchers. The images show both gray and white brain matter. The more intensively a child had engaged with digital media, the smaller and less functional the structures were. Martin is very keen to make parents aware of such consequences when their baby handles a screen, even if it's not for hours, but only a few minutes a day. He is therefore co-author of the medical guideline ""Prevention of Dysregulated Screen Media Use,"" which recommends that parents keep their child away from any display until the age of 3. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend similarly strict measures: Children up to the age of 2 should never be left alone with digital screens. From 3 years old, a maximum of one hour per day — and only accompanied by an adult. The only exception: video calls with grandma or grandpa. Children who did not use digital media as babies and toddlers were ahead in brain activity compared to peers who spent a lot of time in front of screens. It's worth delving deeper into the state of research, with the help of an expert. Sabina Pauen is a professor of developmental psychology and researches mainly category and concept acquisition as well as causal understanding in early childhood at the University of Heidelberg. In other words, she investigates how children learn to understand the world. She also deals with self-regulation and the social-cognitive development of young children through interactions. In short: Everything that could be relevant to the question of how harmful the use of digital screens is for very young children. She warns against jumping to conclusions about the dangers of screens for toddlers. Pauen notes that the state of research is anything but clear-cut. Often, for example, the data basis is very thin. For instance, while the images of toddlers' brains from the U.S. study are impressive, and the conclusion that the brain structures of children who spent a lot of time in front of screens appear less large and less capable is correct, only 47 children were examined. Nothing can be deduced about causal factors from such correlative studies. Forget it. Moreover, the young subjects had above-average screen use. What other potentially relevant factors could have played a role? How stimulating do the parents make family life? What eating habits do they have? The researchers don't address these questions. ""Nothing can be deduced about causal factors from such correlative studies,"" says Pauen. ""Forget it."" The topic of screen time for children is a broad field, almost unmanageable for researchers. There are smartphones, tablets, laptops, children's computers and televisions that have been around for decades. What can be seen there ranges from texts to images and films to interactive games. There is content of all levels for adults and now also for children. The diversity of media, their forms, content and use makes scientific investigation complicated because comparison is complicated. For valid statements, researchers also need time. A lot of time, at least more than rapid technological progress often allows them for long-term studies. Screen use becoming higher in toddlers Another difficulty for researchers nowadays is finding comparison groups of children who grow up completely without screens. In Germany, almost all households have internet, Wi-Fi and smartphones. And the number of young children up to 3 years old who not only use digital devices but already have their own is continuously increasing: 10 years ago, only 3% of children had their own computer. Today, 21% do. But regardless of whether it's on their own device, that of their parents or their older brother's, on average, today's 2- and 3-year-olds watch more than an hour of films, videos, shows on some kind of screen — each day. Researchers must therefore constantly create more sophisticated study designs. They would also have to work with the largest possible cohorts and equally large comparison groups, which also bring similar framework conditions in terms of age, time, content of media use, as well as their socioeconomic background and health status, for the collected data to be meaningful at all. This is simply hardly feasible. Serious researchers are aware of these difficulties. That's why, for example, the team that recorded the impressive images of brain activity in relation to screen use by young children in Singapore writes: ""Further efforts are urgently needed to investigate the direct relationship between children's screen consumption and family factors."" And even if a study is well-conducted, scientifically sound and transparent, there's still the task of weighing and interpreting the results. For example, the study on children's increased BMI does show a correlation with their screen time and therefore a greater risk of Type 2 diabetes. But the same data also shows that birthweight and length, as well as how long the child was subsequently breastfed are much more relevant for this health risk. So if a mother feeds both herself and her baby healthily, that's much more crucial for her child's development. Screens are everywhere Vitolda Klein/Unsplash Not a reward Does this data situation mean absolution for parents who occasionally hand their 2-year-old a smartphone, or are these parents actually jeopardizing their child's well-being? Pauen initially responds with the admittedly interpretable but also incredibly relieving sentence: ""It depends."" The researcher doesn't concur with the drastic demands for absolutely no screen use. She is convinced that parents feel offended by the radical demand for total abstinence — and then completely shut down instead of consciously dealing with the topic of screen time. But that's crucial. Because besides all the possible physical and neurological consequences, spending a lot of time in front of a screen can also have emotional-psychological effects on a child. What these are depends not only on the absolute duration but also on the how. On the one hand, using digital screens affects a child's self-regulation. Learning to deal with one's feelings — especially unpleasant ones like anger and frustration — is an important process. Parents should absolutely avoid using the tablet or phone as a reward or comfort. ""However, if I as a child learn that 'When I'm bored or frustrated, I turn on my tablet,' that's an avoidance mode,"" explains Pauen. ""And that ultimately worsens the problem because the child doesn't learn more suitable strategies for regulating unpleasant feelings."" For this reason, parents should indeed absolutely avoid using the tablet or phone as a reward or comfort. ""It's like with sweets,"" says Pauen. ""If you declare something as a reward, the child associates it with pleasant feelings — and will later crave it all the more intensely."" This can develop into a real vicious cycle. If a child spends a lot of time in front of a screen, it will lead to new frustration situations on other levels — poorer school results, for example — and then the child will reach for the phone or tablet even faster to escape the newly created frustration again. If you give a screen to very young children, do it as consciously as possible, not as a reward or consolation and above all, use the screen together. An important factor in this complex learning process for babies and toddlers is the experience of seeing their own emotions reflected in their parents' faces. Anyone who has ever leaned over a baby knows this: You automatically imitate their facial expression. This is not a cute coincidence, but vital for the child. It teaches them to read and interpret faces and that emotions can be shared with other people. What they feel matches what they see. A cell phone display can severely disrupt this feedback. Which brings us to the parents' cell phone. If you secretly look at your own screen in front of your baby, your face will reflect your reaction to whatever you are looking at — and not to your own baby. This creates a discrepancy that a child cannot interpret. A baby can't understand why mom is smiling when she is grimacing because she is cold. And it can't see the funny meme that she has just received on WhatsApp. Children who are regularly exposed to such situations react confused and stressed, and in extreme cases aggressively. Researchers refer to this relatively new disorder of parent-child interaction as technoference. Pauen is also planning an experimental study and wants to install a camera on her office window. This will record all the parents push a baby carriage on the sidewalk below the window. It sounds as if you've already done something wrong as a parent if you type a reply back to your friend's message even though you're breastfeeding or giving your baby a bottle. This is happening more and more frequently. “Unfortunately,” Pauen says. Developing parental care Pauen explains matter-of-factly: Humans are creatures that have certain needs and are dependent on others responding to these needs. A baby cannot communicate its needs verbally. It is particularly dependent on the adults around it noticing what it needs. If parents don't look and listen, they won't notice. And this doesn't just apply to a single, specific moment. Humans do have a predisposition for parental care. But when we become parents, we also need to develop this further — in continuous interaction with our child. Those who have little interaction miss out on important opportunities to learn to understand their child. The world has been digital for a few decades now. As parents, there's no getting around it. So if you really need to respond to emails or do something on the computer or cell phone, you are better advised to clearly signal this to your child and then not be available for this time. The boundary can be another room or at least a clear turning away. Working from home is a particular challenge in this context, and good childcare is simply necessary for this reason, too. The world is what it is, and it has been digital for a few decades now. As parents, there's no getting around it. So if you give a screen to very young children, then please do it as consciously as possible, not as a reward or consolation and above all, use the screen together. Adapting to screens? At the end, the professor of developmental psychology puts forward a hypothesis that gives every stressed parent hope: She believes it is possible that we humans could adapt to digital circumstances. Just as we quickly learned to focus on our eyes to interpret facial expressions in the face of all the mask-wearing people during the pandemic, we could also adapt to the modern human behavior of looking at screens. This hypothesis may be supported by the experiment in which 2-year-olds were unable to find their toy if they only observed the person who had hidden it on a screen: Very young children, aged just 6 or 10 months, can indeed draw age-appropriate conclusions from what they have watched on a screen. Only then do they begin to no longer associate reality with what they have seen on the screen. This seems paradoxical, and the explanation is fascinating: Children older than 1 year have learned in the meantime that what they see on a screen does not always correspond to reality: Cars cannot fly! There are no talking rubber balls! They now overgeneralize this knowledge — and no longer consider anything they only see on video to be true. They only start to differentiate at the age of 3 that some of it is fantasy, but some is also a reflection of reality. Proof of this explanation was provided by a clever variation of the same experiment: 2-year-olds were again shown on a screen how someone was hiding a toy. This time, however, they were made to believe that they were observing the process through a real window. Afterward, they were perfectly capable of finding the toy. *Originally published Jan. 1, 2025, this article was updated Jan. 5, 2024 with enriched media.

https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/the-us-persecutes-people-for-non-conformity-and-political-views/,https://www.axios.com/2024/09/05/dimitri-simes-mueller-russian-tv-indictment,2024-09-05,"The former president of the Center for the National Interest who was repeatedly named in the Mueller report on Russian interference in the 2016 election was charged with working for a sanctioned Russian television station and laundering the funds. Why it matters: These charges follow a series of announcements from the Biden administration Wednesday targeting Russian influence schemes, one of which involved another state-owned network allegedly deceiving online commentators with the intent to amplify Kremlin propaganda. The indictment alleges Russian-born Dimitri Simes andhis wife Anastasia Simes participated in a plot to violate sanctions to benefit Russian state-owned broadcaster Channel One Russia, which was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2022. Simes was a presenter for Channel One Russia and collected over $1 million from the network since it was sanctioned by the Treasury Department, the indictment alleges. He additionally received a personal car, a stipend for a Moscow apartment and a team of 10 employees. While illegally working for the network, the indictment alleges Simes spoke with several Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, and was instructed on how to cover certain topics, such as the war in Ukraine. Driving the news: Simes' name was mentioned dozens of times in the 2019 Mueller report detailing Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election for his then-think tank's work with the Trump campaign. The report outlined his interactions with members of the former president's circle, including former President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. It also details a foreign policy speech delivered by Trump at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., that Simes' think tank helped to organize. He was not charged with any crime related to the investigation and subsequent report, which read, ""The investigation did not identify evidence that the Campaign passed or received any messages to or from the Russian government through CNI or Simes."" What they're saying: ""These defendants allegedly violated sanctions that were put in place in response to Russia's illegal aggression in Ukraine,"" U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves said in a statement. ""Such violations harm our national security interests—a fact that Dimitri Simes, with the deep experience he gained in national affairs after fleeing the Soviet Union and becoming a U.S. citizen, should have uniquely appreciated,"" he continued. Zoom out: A second indictment announced Thursday detailed a scheme in which Anastasia Simes and others purchased art and antiques to benefit sanctioned oligarch Aleksandr Yevgenyevich Udodov. Anastasia Simes would allegedly purchase items from galleries and auction houses in the United States and Europe, then ship the items to the Simes' home in Huntly, Va., where they were stored to be shipped to Russia. She was reimbursed in return and received a service fee, according to court filings. State of play: The couple has a home in Virginia but is thought to be at large in Russia, the DOJ said in a release. A Russian influence operation used unwitting, prominent right-wing influencers to spread propaganda ahead of the 2024 election, the Justice Department alleged Wednesday. Why it matters: The influencer scheme is yet another chapter in Russia's long running effort to infiltrate the opinions of American audiences via social media and online manipulation. The Justice Department announced Wednesday that it is seizing 32 domains tied to a Russian influence campaign accused of spreading propaganda to influence voters in U.S. and foreign elections. Why it matters: Members of Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle directed Russian companies to promote disinformation as part of a campaign to influence the 2024 election, the Justice Department alleged. Russian disinformation warfare is more calculated and intentional than ever — as it employs more strategies that require hefty financial investments and long-term planning. Why it matters: These new tactics make it much harder to decipher between a legitimate U.S. influencer posting about the election and a Russian operative posing as an American pundit.",CREDIBLE

But he added the Kremlin was investigating “who ordered” the attack and implied Kyiv was responsible. “The question that arises is who benefits from this? This atrocity may be just a link in a whole series of attempts by those who have been at war with our country since 2014 by the hands of the neo-Nazi Kyiv regime,” Putin claimed.",CREDIBLE

The corridor lay along the lower course of the Vistula River and consisted of West Prussia and most of the province of Posen (Poznań), which the Treaty of Versailles (1919) had transferred from defeated Germany to Poland. Perhaps no provision of the treaty caused so much animosity and resentment among Germans as this arrangement, for the corridor ran between Pomerania and East Prussia and separated the latter province from the main body of the German Reich to the west. On the other hand, it should be noted that (1) the territory was historically Polish (that is, before the partitions of Poland in the late 18th century) and was inhabited by a Polish majority; (2) the provision accorded with the 13th of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points, for giving Poland “a free and secure access to the sea” and indeed its only access; and (3) the territory ceded did not include Danzig (Gdańsk), then a purely German town, which was established as a free city under the sovereignty of the League of Nations. Poland developed the corridor port of Gdynia as an alternative to Danzig. Free German transit was permitted across the corridor. The Polish Corridor was the issue, or at least the apparent pretext, over which World War II began. In March 1939 the Nazi dictator of Germany, Adolf Hitler, demanded the cession of Danzig and the creation of extraterritorial German highways across the corridor connecting to East Prussia. Poland refused these demands and secured French and British guarantees against German aggression. In September Germany invaded Poland, thus beginning the war. Hitler annexed the Polish Corridor, Danzig, Posen, and districts along the Silesian frontier and placed the rest of the conquered Polish territory under a German governor. But after World War II the whole area was remapped, with great shifts of German and Polish populations, and the issue disappeared, as the Polish Corridor, along with Gdańsk and East Prussia, became part of postwar Poland. Germany, country of north-central Europe, traversing the continent’s main physical divisions, from the outer ranges of the Alps northward across the varied landscape of the Central German Uplands and then across the North German Plain. One of Europe’s largest countries, Germany encompasses a wide variety of landscapes: the tall, sheer mountains of the south; the sandy, rolling plains of the north; the forested hills of the urbanized west; and the plains of the agricultural east. At the spiritual heart of the country is the magnificent east-central city of Berlin, which rose phoenixlike from the ashes of World War II and now, after decades of partition, is the capital of a reunified Germany, and the Rhine River, which flows northward from Switzerland and is celebrated in visual art, literature, folklore, and song. Along its banks and those of its principal tributaries—among them the Neckar, Main, Moselle, and Ruhr—stand hundreds of medieval castles, churches, picturesque villages, market towns, and centers of learning and culture, including Heidelberg, the site of one of Europe’s oldest universities (founded in 1386), and Mainz, historically one of Europe’s most important publishing centers. All are centerpieces of Germany’s thriving tourist economy, which brings millions of visitors to the country each year, drawn by its natural beauty, history, culture, and cuisine (including its renowned wines and beers). The name Germany has long described not a particular place but the loose, fluid polity of Germanic-speaking peoples that held sway over much of western Europe north of the Alps for millennia. Although Germany in that sense is an ancient entity, the German nation in more or less its present form came into being only in the 19th century, when Prussian Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck brought together dozens of German-speaking kingdoms, principalities, free cities, bishoprics, and duchies to form the German Empire in 1871. This so-called Second Reich quickly became Europe’s leading power and acquired colonies in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. That overseas empire was dismantled following Germany’s defeat in World War I and the abdication of Emperor William II. Economic depression, widespread unemployment, and political strife that verged on civil war followed, leading to the collapse of the progressive Weimar Republic and the rise of the Nazi Party under Adolf Hitler. After gaining power in 1933, Hitler established the Third Reich and soon thereafter embarked on a ruinous crusade to conquer Europe and exterminate Jews, Roma (Gypsies), homosexuals, and others. The Third Reich disintegrated in 1945, brought down by the Allied armies of the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, France, and other countries. The victorious powers divided Germany into four zones of occupation and later into two countries: the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), separated for more than 40 years by a long boundary. In East Germany this boundary was, until the fall of its communist government in 1989, marked by defenses designed to prevent escape. The 185 square miles (480 square km) of the “island” of West Berlin were similarly ringed from 1961 to 1989 by the Berlin Wall running through the city and by a heavily guarded wire-mesh fence in the areas abutting the East German countryside. Although Berlin was a flashpoint between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the city declined in national and international significance until 1989–90, when a popular and peaceful uprising toppled the East German government and soon after restored a united Berlin as the capital of a reunified Germany. Since World War II, Germany has made great efforts to both commemorate the victims and redress the crimes of the Holocaust, providing strong material and political support for the state of Israel and actively prosecuting hate crimes and the propagation of neo-Nazi doctrine; the latter became an issue in the 1990s with the rise in Germany of anti-immigrant skinhead groups and the availability of Hitler’s Mein Kampf over the Internet. Clearly, modern Germany struggles to balance its national interests with those of an influx of political and economic refugees from far afield, especially North Africa, Turkey, and South Asia, an influx that has fueled ethnic tensions and swelled the ranks of nationalist political parties, particularly in eastern Germany, where unemployment was double that of the west. Tensions became especially acute in the second decade of the 21st century, when more than one million migrants entered Germany in the wake of the revolutions of the Arab Spring and the Syrian Civil War. The constitution of the republic, adopted in 1949 by West Germany, created a federal system that gives significant government powers to its constituentLänder (states). Before unification there were 11 West German Länder (including West Berlin, which had the special status of a Land without voting rights), but, with the accession of East Germany, there are now 16 Länder in the unified republic. The largest of the states is Bavaria (Bayern), the richest is Baden-Württemberg, and the most populous is North Rhine–Westphalia (Nordrhein-Westfalen). Matters of national importance, such as defense and foreign affairs, are reserved to the federal government. At both the state and federal levels, parliamentary democracy prevails. The Federal Republic has been a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) since 1955 and was a founding member of the European Economic Community (seeEuropean Union). During the four decades of partition, the Federal Republic concluded a number of agreements with the Soviet Union and East Germany, which it supported to some extent economically in return for various concessions with regard to humanitarian matters and access to Berlin. West Germany’s rapid economic recovery in the 1950s (Wirtschaftswunder, or “economic miracle”) brought it into a leading position among the world’s economic powers, a position that it has maintained.

Much of Germany’s post-World War II success has been the result of the renowned industriousness and self-sacrifice of its people, about which novelist Günter Grass, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1999, remarked, “To be a German is to make the impossible possible.” He added, more critically, For in our country everything is geared to growth. We’re never satisfied. For us enough is never enough. We always want more. If it’s on paper, we convert it into reality. Even in our dreams we’re productive. This devotion to hard work has combined with a public demeanor—which is at once reserved and assertive—to produce a stereotype of the German people as aloof and distant. Yet Germans prize both their private friendships and their friendly relations with neighbors and visitors, place a high value on leisure and culture, and enjoy the benefits of life in a liberal democracy that has become ever more integrated with and central to a united Europe.

Poverty in the United States As shown in the statistic above, the poverty rate among all people living in the United States has shifted within the last 15 years. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) defines poverty as follows: “Absolute poverty measures poverty in relation to the amount of money necessary to meet basic needs such as food, clothing, and shelter. The concept of absolute poverty is not concerned with broader quality of life issues or with the overall level of inequality in society.” The poverty rate in the United States varies widely across different ethnic groups. American Indians and Alaska Natives are the ethnic group with the most people living in poverty in 2022, with about 25 percent of the population earning an income below the poverty line. In comparison to that, only 8.6 percent of the White (non-Hispanic) population and the Asian population were living below the poverty line in 2022. Children are one of the most poverty endangered population groups in the U.S. between 1990 and 2022. Child poverty peaked in 1993 with 22.7 percent of children living in poverty in that year in the United States. Between 2000 and 2010, the child poverty rate in the United States was increasing every year; however,this rate was down to 15 percent in 2022. The number of people living in poverty in the U.S. varies from state to state.

Mr Stoltenberg praised Armenia for its long-standing partnership and contributions to NATO operations, including increased troop numbers in KFOR’s peacekeeping mission. “For nearly 20 years, Armenia has been a key partner in NATO’s KFOR peacekeeping mission, helping to ensure a safe and secure environment for all communities in Kosovo,” he said. On stability in the South Caucasus, the Secretary General urged Armenia and Azerbaijan to reach an agreement to pave the way for the normalisation of relations and a durable peace. “This matters for Euro-Atlantic security as we face a more dangerous world,” he emphasised, reiterating that “NATO supports Armenian sovereignty and territorial integrity, and your peaceful aspirations.” The Secretary General warned that “Russia’s war in Ukraine is a sobering reminder that we cannot take peace for granted… If Putin succeeds in Ukraine, there is a real risk that his aggression will not stop there and other authoritarian actors will be emboldened,” he said. Mr Stoltenberg called on all NATO partners to “do what they can to ensure Putin does not win his war of aggression.” “The situation on the battlefield remains difficult, but this is a reason to step up, not to scale back our support,” he said. During his visit, the Secretary General discussed the progress in Armenia’s domestic reforms. He highlighted Armenia’s commitment to ensuring democratic control of its armed forces, including by participating in NATO’s building integrity programme. “You have also shown a real commitment to tackling corruption, strengthening your democratic institutions, and upholding the rule of law,” he concluded.",CREDIBLE

The law on civil partnerships was adopted. Background In August, prime minister Arturs Krišjānis Kariņš was replaced by Evika Siliņa, who led a new coalition government. Torture and other ill-treatment In July, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture reported allegations of ill-treatment of people in police custody and prisons. People in migration detention also reported to the Committee cases of severe ill-treatment by officials at the border. Refugees’ and migrants’ rights In June, legal amendments granted border guards powers to “prevent” irregular entries at the border, which in practice can result in unlawful summary returns.1 Another amendment – triggered in August and due to expire in February 2024 – introduced the option of activating an “enhanced” border protection regime in case of “disproportionately large” irregular crossings. Between August 2021 and August 2023, when a state of emergency was in force at Latvia’s borders allowing summary returns, border officials committed serious abuses against refugees and migrants. During the year, Latvia reported 13,863 “prevented” border crossings, increasing from 5,286 in 2022. Human rights defenders In January, the authorities opened criminal proceedings for smuggling against two members of the NGO I Want to Help Refugees, for their work assisting refugees and migrants at the border. Discrimination As a result of legislative changes in 2022 connected to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, certain permanent residence permits granted to Russian citizens were set to expire in September. Almost 18,000 people affected had to pass a Latvian language test as part of the procedure to renew their residence permits. At the end of the year, 1,213 Russian citizens were liable to be deported, having failed to regularize their stay under the amended law. The ombudsman observed that this requirement risked violating the constitutional principle of equality and non-discrimination. In October, media and journalists’ organizations expressed concern about a parliament-backed proposal, that from 2026 onwards public media would only produce content in Latvian and languages belonging to the “European cultural space”, affecting access to information for the large Russian-speaking population. Gender-based violence On 30 November, Latvia ratified the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention). LGBTI people’s rights The law on civil partnership was finally adopted in November. Right to a healthy environment Unlike most EU countries, Latvia’s greenhouse gas emissions in the first and second quarters of the year were higher than the same period in 2022. The European Commission continued infringement proceedings against Latvia for failure to comply with EU standards on reduction of emissions of certain pollutants. Economic, social and cultural rights Following recommendations by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 2021, the statutory minimum wage was increased from EUR 500 to EUR 620 per month and several other benefit payments were increased.",CREDIBLE

In more than a year of war, the rf army has inflicted many mutilations on our country. Find out more about which cities the occupiers have mercilessly wiped off the face of the Еarth The full-scale war in Ukraine is one of the most brutal in recent decades. The last time Europe saw such destruction was in the 1990s, when fighting broke out in Yugoslavia. Despite the absurdity of war in the 21st century, russian troops continue to target civilians and commit war crimes. In this article, we will tell you about the Ukrainian cities that the russian army has destroyed since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in 2022. According to estimates, as of the beginning of 2023, the russian army has launched about 5,000 missiles and 3,500 air strikes against Ukraine. The invaders launched almost 1000 more strikes using kamikaze drones. These figures do not include shelling from artillery and multiple launch rocket systems. According to preliminary estimates by the Ukrainian authorities, more than 350,000 facilities and millions of square meters of residential, educational, medical, and sports infrastructure have been destroyed in the country, and thousands of kilometers of roads and railways, airports, ports, and much more have been damaged. During the russian attacks, missiles and shells fall in densely populated cities and villages where civilians still live. However, there are settlements in Ukraine that could not survive the attacks of the russian occupiers. Which cities in Ukraine were completely destroyed by the russians? Mariupol (Donetsk region) Is a city that has been under fire since the very first days of the war. A few days after russia's invasion of Ukraine, enemy troops began a blockade of the city. The occupiers bombed the town with all the weapons they had at their disposal. One of the most horrific moments of the war was the bloody bombing of the Mariupol Drama Theater, where people were hiding from the shelling. According to various sources, between 300 and 600 civilians, including children, were killed. Volnovakha (Donetsk region) The fighting for Volnovakha and the Volnovakha district lasted from 26 February to 12 March 2022. After the almost complete destruction of the region, a decision was made to withdraw the Armed Forces of Ukraine to save the lives of Ukrainian soldiers. During the fighting for Volnovakha, the russian side used the tactic of massive indiscriminate shelling of the city, including residential areas and civilian infrastructure. Sievierodonetsk (Luhansk region) The fighting for the city lasted for two months. Although the settlement was not of strategic importance, russians chaotically attacked the city. According to the Ukrainian authorities, the city was destroyed by 90% as a result of massive bombardment by the russian army. ""When we release Sievierodonetsk and Rubizhne, we will be horrified. What we will see if we enter the cities will break our hearts once again, because it is worse than Pripyat... there is no life there at all,"" said Serhiy Gaidai, former head of the Luhansk regional military administration. Maryinka (Donetsk region) Destroyed houses and shell craters are all that remains of Maryinka, a town east of Donetsk. The small town has survived fierce attacks by russian forces, who are still trying to take control of the Ukrainian Donbas. Before the war, almost 10,000 people lived in Marinka, but now the town is devastated. Marinka has survived ruthless artillery duels, after which it looked like a set for an apocalypse movie. The occupation forces deliberately destroyed houses to prevent them from being used as shelters. Don't want to miss important updates and useful articles? Subscribe to our weekly newsletter! Soledar (Donetsk region) Russian troops have completely destroyed the town of Soledar in Donetsk region, which was home to about 10,000 people before the full-scale war. Satellite images show that there is literally not a single building left in the city. Bakhmut (Donetsk region) Is a town that russian troops have been storming for almost 10 months. Attacks on the small town continue daily. Due to the ongoing fighting, rows of apartment buildings, schools, shops and other infrastructure have been reduced to smoldering ruins. Parts of the city that were surrounded by trees and parks a year ago are now completely devoid of all vegetation and covered with brown dust and debris. Bakhmut has faced an environmental disaster due to the actions of the russian army, which fires hundreds of shells at the city every day. We have shown only a part of the cities that were destroyed due to russia's full-scale aggression. In fact, there are many more destroyed settlements. Cities such as Rubizhne, Popasna, Lyman and Izium have also suffered greatly at the hands of the occupiers. Air attacks on Ukrainian cities continue We should not forget that the russian army continues its aggression against Ukraine. Missile and air bombardments have not become rare, but rather continue to cause more and more damage to Ukrainians. Earlier, The New York Times published an extensive study that assessed the extent of the destruction in Ukraine since the beginning of the russian invasion. According to the estimates, between February 2022 and December 2023, about 210,000 buildings were destroyed in Ukraine, mostly located along the nearly 1,300-kilometre-long frontline. Settlements in Kharkiv, Kyiv, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro, Sumy, and Chernihiv regions continue to suffer from daily shelling. Every day, russian shelling destroys the civilian infrastructure of these regions and kills people living there. In view of these circumstances, we advise foreign tourists planning to visit Ukraine to take a responsible approach to their safety and take out an insurance policy covering military risks. And don't forget that Ukraine needs the support of the entire democratic world. It is important to continue to remind others of the insidious war that Ukrainians are experiencing in the 21st century.

This aerial activity, which now occurs on a near-daily basis, is reported by the Taiwan Defense Ministry. The Taiwan ADIZ Violations Database, compiled by independent defense analyst Benjamin Lewis, illustrates a marked escalation in Chinese military operations near Taiwan in recent years. The ADIZ, an area where a country asserts authority to identify aircraft for national security purposes, has been a focal point amid heightened tensions between China and Taiwan. China maintains its claim over Taiwan as sovereign territory, despite the current government in Beijing never having ruled on the island. Notably, the figures for last year fell slightly short of the 1,738 ADIZ sorties reported in 2022 due to a quieter December, which saw the lowest incursion rate since July 2022. However, 2023 still saw nearly 76 percent more of these flights than the 972 reported in 2021—the first full year they were commonplace. Taiwan's defense ministry began issuing reports on Chinese military activities in the Taiwan Strait in September 2020, after Beijing ended its former policy of largely confining its activities to its side of the 100-mile-wide waterway. The shift followed visits by high-ranking officials from the administration of former U.S. President Donald Trump. Lewis' database has highlighted an increasing diversity of aircraft types entering the zone annually. December witnessed the detection of 13 distinct aircraft, including various fighter jets, bombers, early warning and anti-submarine planes. April showcased the most diverse array, with 20 distinct airframes. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones, a recent inclusion in Taiwan's defense reports since September 2022, have constituted approximately 9 percent of the reported aircraft in recent months, Lewis pointed out. China's foreign ministry didn't respond to Newsweek's written request for comment by publication time. Analysts view the flights by China's People's Liberation Army into Taiwan's ADIZ as a form of gray-zone activity, or pressure that stops short of kinetic warfare. Bonnie Glaser, managing director of the German Marshall Fund of the United States Indo-Pacific Program, previously told Newsweek that in addition to asserting its sovereignty claims, Beijing aims to use the sorties to wear down Taiwan's more limited armed forces by forcing them to scramble fighters with each intrusion. ""Beijing also seeks to erode the confidence of the Taiwanese people in their ability to defend their way of life,"" she added. Crossings over the strait's invisible demarcation are not limited to aircraft. Taiwan's defense authorities also include PLA Navy warships on their daily updates of Taiwan Strait activity. Maritime ADIZ violations picked up after former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's controversial visit to Taipei in August 2022. These vessels sometimes come as close as Taiwan's contiguous zone, a 24-nautical-mile buffer bordering the self-ruled island's territorial waters. One such instance last month saw a Taiwanese frigate intercept two Chinese ships—a frigate and a destroyer. The ensuing heated radio exchange was picked up and shared by plane-spotting group Taiwan ADIZ. Starting in December, Taiwan's defense authorities also started reporting what are believed to be Chinese weather balloons. Experts have told Newsweek the balloons' relatively low sub-30,000-foot altitudes make them unlikely to be primarily used for surveillance.

We watch and enjoy it live or on TV. Sport is all around us, representing an integral part of the lives of millions of Europeans. Especially so this summer, after the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, the biggest global sporting event of all, kicked off yesterday, with an Opening Ceremony broadcasted globally. For the first time the EU featured very prominently in the Paris 2024 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony with a performance on a floating barge under the European Union motto “United in diversity”. On the boat were dancers, symbolizing youth, the spirit of openness and dynamism of the EU, who danced to Eurodance music. This was a unique opportunity for the EU to promote its values such as peace, unity and solidarity, where diversity is a strength, and team spirit a key for success, linking them with those of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. The Olympic Games also offer the occasion to highlight the importance of freedom of movement and study in the EU, especially for young people, as well as EU policies and activities linked to support to sports and youth. We also launched the European medal counter – Team Europe 2024 for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, where you will be able to follow and celebrate the achievements of EU athletes by counting their medals. But what does the EU do to promote sport? Sport should be for everyone. That is why the EU promotes it through its Erasmus+ programme, promoting dialogue, support and participation across all areas of sport policy. There is also the European Week of Sport which runs every year from 23 to 30 September, an initiative which promotes benefits of sport and physical activity across Europe at national, regional and local levels. Making sport accessible for everyone is also about fostering a sense of social inclusion and integration. Every year, the Commission recognises organisations whose work uses the power of sport to improve social inclusion for disadvantaged groups through the #BeInclusive EU Sport Awards. It also works with all EU countries and national sport organisations to raise awareness about the importance of gender equality in sport. Sport should also be fair, particularly in competitive and professional sports. The EU protects integrity in sport by fighting against doping, which it does by coordinating and sharing information with international partners. When it comes to match-fixing, the Commission takes an active role, as part of wider efforts to ensure competitive sports remain fair. Through these efforts to make sport fairer, more inclusive and more accessible, the EU is helping to meet its core values of peace, unity, solidarity and diversity. And that’s how it should be. After all, sport plays a vital role, not only in individual health and fitness, but in shaping our wider European society.

These political transformation and democratic consolidation processes, however, have not been fully completed in any of these countries, and the political systems of the Baltic States are marked by similar dynamics. Party competition in all the three states is highly volatile, resulting in frequent changes of governments. Trust in politics and political institutions is lacking, and voter turnout rates are low, with 50% in Lithuania, almost 60% in Lativa and 64% in Estonia. The readiness to participate in political processes in the Baltic States is weak. So far, there is no strong, critical or active civil society in any of these countries. The Friedrich Ebert Foundation strives to contribute with its work to the strengthening of democratic structures and civil society of the Baltic States, and promote social and political participation and engagement. FES' approach is creating platforms for a dialogue between stakeholders and multipliers in politics, civil society and academia, promoting political participation through political education and supporting social discourse on the challenges of social democracy in the Baltic States with regional and international projects.

There are now more than half a million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 20,000 deaths. These are tragic numbers, but let's also remember that around the world, more than 100,000 people have recovered. Yesterday, I had the honour of addressing an extraordinary meeting of leaders from the G20 countries. My message was threefold: we must fight, unite and ignite. Fight to stop the virus with every resource at our disposal; Unite to confront the pandemic together. We are one humanity, with one, common enemy. No country can fight alone; we can only fight together. And ignite the industrial might and innovation of the G20 to produce and distribute the tools needed to save lives. We must also make a promise to future generations, saying never again. Viral outbreaks are a fact of life. How much damage they do is something we can influence. I thank the G20 countries for their commitment to fight the pandemic, safeguard the global economy, address international trade disruptions and enhance global cooperation. This is especially important for countries who are not part of the G20 but will be affected by decisions made by G20 countries. Earlier today, we held a briefing with around 50 Ministers of Health from around the world at which China, Japan, the Republic of Korea and Singapore shared their experiences and the lessons they have learned. Several common themes emerged about what has worked: The need for early detection and isolation of confirmed cases; Identification, follow-up and quarantine of contacts; The need to optimize care; And the need to communicate to build trust and engage communities in the fight. Countries also expressed several common challenges. The chronic global shortage of personal protective equipment is now one of the most urgent threats to our collective ability to save lives. WHO has shipped almost 2 million individual items of protective gear to 74 countries that need it most, and we’re preparing to send a similar amount to a further 60 countries. But much more is needed. This problem can only be solved with international cooperation and international solidarity. When health workers are at risk, we’re all at risk. Health workers in low- and middle-income countries deserve the same protection as those in the wealthiest countries. To support our call on all countries to conduct aggressive case-finding and testing, we’re also working urgently to massively increase the production and capacity for testing around the world. One of the most important areas of international cooperation is research and development. A vaccine is still at least 12 to 18 months away. In the meantime, we recognize that there is an urgent need for therapeutics to treat patients and save lives. Today we are delighted to announce that in Norway and Spain, the first patients will shortly be enrolled in the Solidarity Trial, which will compare the safety and effectiveness of four different drugs or drug combinations against COVID-19. This is a historic trial which will dramatically cut the time needed to generate robust evidence about what drugs work. More than 45 countries are contributing to the trial, and more have expressed interest. The more countries who join the trial, the faster we will have results. In the meantime, we call on individuals and countries to refrain from using therapeutics that have not been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19. The history of medicine is strewn with examples of drugs that worked on paper, or in a test tube, but didn't work in humans or were actually harmful. During the most recent Ebola epidemic, for example, some medicines that were thought to be effective were found not to be as effective as other medicines when they were compared during a clinical trial. We must follow the evidence. There are no short-cuts. We also need to ensure that using unproven drugs does not create a shortage of those medicines to treat diseases for which they have proven effective. As the pandemic evolves and more countries are affected, we are learning more and more lessons about what works and what doesn't. WHO is continuing to support all countries in the response. We’ve published more than 40 guidance documents on our website, providing detailed, evidence-based recommendations for governments, hospitals, health workers, members of the public and more. More than 1 million health workers have been trained through our courses on OpenWHO.org. We will continue to train more. We’re also delighted to report that the COVID-19 Solidarity Fund has now received donations of more than US$ 108 million in just two weeks, from 203,000 individuals and organizations. Thank you to each and every one of you. The English version of our WhatsApp Health Alert now has more than 12 million users globally, and the Arabic, French and Spanish versions were launched today. More languages will be added, including Bangla, Chinese, Hindi, Kurdish, Portuguese, Russian, Somali, Urdu, Swahili and more. I’ve said before that crises like this bring out the best and worst in humanity. We have recently seen an increase in scams, cyberattacks and impersonation using WHO, my name and COVID-19. I am very grateful to those working in various national organizations providing critical cybersecurity intelligence to the WHO Cybersecurity team. Thank you for your efforts to work with us to protect the health systems, health workers and members of the general public who rely on our information systems and digital tools. Special thanks to Microsoft for assisting on this. I’d like to end with something Singapore’s Minister of Health, Gan Kim Yong, said during today’s briefing. We are only at the beginning of this fight. We need to stay calm, stay united and work together. I thank you.",CREDIBLE

A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone. A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.

This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities. If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear. An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.

For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns. You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase. You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.

The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics. An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

The exercises, which will take place mainly in Central Europe, will involve some 90,000 troops from all NATO countries as well as Sweden. The exercises will test the ability of the Alliance's forces to deter and defend, including countering a potential adversary’s aggression against NATO countries. Poland as one of host nation of the STDE-24 exercise will host a significant number of Allied troops and equipment on its territory. A key element of STDE-24 will be the Polish national exercise with the participation of the armed forces of other countries, DRAGON-24 (DR-24), which will begin as early as late February/early March. Both STDE-24 and DR-24 are defensive exercises and are not directed against any country, but are a demonstration of the ability to counter any aggressive policies and provocative activities of the Russian Federation. Their planning began already in 2022. The STEADFAST DEFENDER 24 exercises, including national exercises with the participation of other countries' armed forces, such as DRAGON-24 and DEFENDER-24 exercise organized by U.S. European Command, will constitute the largest demonstration of the defense capabilities of the Alliance and its member states since 1999, i.e. since the so-called first wave of NATO enlargement, which included Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. The exercises will coincide with NATO's 75th anniversary celebrations. DR-24 exercise will constitute a test of the Polish Armed Forces' ability to respond to a potential multidimensional armed crisis, thus contributing to strengthening the Alliance's deterrence and defense capabilities and demonstrating the strength and determination stemming from its unity. The DR-24 exercise will involve a total of about 20,000 soldiers and 3,500 units of equipment from 10 NATO countries, including about 15,000 soldiers of the Polish Armed Forces. They will be subjected to a test of interaction and execution of combat tasks on land, in the air and at sea. In addition to military operations in the above mentioned domains, military operations will also be carried out in cyberspace. The main forces participating in the exercise will be assigned by the 11th Armored Cavalry Division, but soldiers from the special forces, air force, navy and territorial defense will also be involved. This year's exercise will comprise elements of Allied troops present in Poland as well, including the NATO eFP (enhanced Forward Presence) battle group. Elements of the non-military part of the country's defense system, from local government administration at the provincial, district and municipal levels to government administration, will also be taking part in DR-24. The exercises will be divided into two general phases. During the first one, crisis situation activities will be carried out, while the second phase will be a defensive operation exercise. Soldiers will carry out their tasks at the field training centers and in the so-called accidental terrain. Key elements will be the crossing of Allied troops over the Vistula River and the movement of the NATO Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF), which will be the linking element between DR-24 and the BRILLIANT JUMP-24 exercise. This will mean, among other things, that both wheeled and tracked military vehicles will move also on public roads throughout the Polish territory.",CREDIBLE

The supersonic, multi-role F-35 represents a quantum leap in air dominance capability with enhanced lethality and survivability in hostile, anti-access airspace environments. - The United States’ offer to Poland for 32 F-35 multi-role aircraft is valued at $4.6 billion. - The United States is providing a Total Package Approach that not only includes delivery of the 32 aircraft, but also provides aircraft, pilot and maintenance support training; advanced flight simulators, and ongoing aircraft maintenance; and a robust logistics support system equally shared with other F-35 partner nations. - Additionally, the Total Package Approach includes future aircraft upgrades, ensuring Poland will always be on the leading edge with its air defense capabilities. The F-35 fifth-generation multi-role fighters, also called “Lightning II”, will: - Fulﬁll Poland’s air combat requirements. Fifth-generation is deﬁned by the combination of Very Low Observables (VLO) stealth characteristics, integrated sensors and avionics, and sensor fusion, all supported by an advanced logistics and sustainment system. These advanced features provide Poland’s Air Force with cutting edge capabilities, delivering the ability to operate freely even in complex and dangerous combat environments. - Provide Poland with a robust defense capability to deter aggression in the region. - Augment Poland’s operational aircraft inventory and enhance its air-to-air and air-to-ground self-defense capability. - Provide Poland with modern systems that will enhance interoperability with U.S. forces and increase security. - Improve the security of Poland and the NATO Alliance. - Strengthen the security and defense partnership between Poland and the United States. Exceptional Capabilities: - The F-35 is currently the most lethal and survivable fighter in the world. - The F-35 combines fifth-generation fighter aircraft characteristics — advanced stealth, integrated avionics, sensor fusion and superior logistics support — to produce the most powerful and comprehensive integrated sensor package of any fighter aircraft in history. - The F-35’s ability to collect, analyze, and share data is unparalleled. This capability allows Polish and NATO forces to work together effectively to deter and defend against threats to the Eastern Flank and return home safely. - By actively sharing threat information with other aircraft, sea- and ground-based forces, the F-35 is a critical force multiplier. It provides current and unique intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance data that identifies targets and passes this information to other aircraft and ground stations. The F-35 is capable of synthesizing the most complete situational awareness picture and serves as a battlespace manager. These unique fifth-generation capabilities can enhance the effectiveness of fourth-generation aircraft in Poland’s armed forces, such as the F-16, through interoperability. - Missions that traditionally would have required a variety of specialized aircraft to execute different tasks — air-to-air combat, air-to-ground strikes, electronic attack, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance — can now be performed by a single squadron of F-35s. - The F-35 enhances Polish Air Force combat capability with its game-changing very low observability stealth characteristics. Its large internal fuel and weapons payload offers a unique combination of long range and excellent maneuverability. - More than 450 F-35s are operating today, with more than 220,000 flight hours. Poland is getting the best the United States has to offer. This is a dependable platform. Better and Cheaper Over Time: - The F-35 design will be continuously modernized to keep it one step – or many steps – ahead of threats. As a result, the aircraft will become even more capable and affordable over its life cycle. - Both production and sustainment costs are coming down. The F-35 already costs the same or less to procure than older fighter jets but provides a transformational leap in capability. - The F-35 allows Poland to leverage and benefit from worldwide investments in a $50 billion development program. Declining acquisition costs; multi-national commonality; advanced sustainment; and common training and support systems make the F-35 the best value for money available. Other Benefits: - An F-35 acquisition is the whole package – not just the aircraft, but also all the training and ongoing support needed to operate this sophisticated fighter. - The F-35 program means upgrading Polish infrastructure across Poland’s military facilities. Those upgrades will make the Polish military more ready to respond in times of crisis. - Infrastructure improvements related to the F-35 mean new employment opportunities across the country, in fields like construction, as well as in the technology sector.",CREDIBLE

Everything changed.” VOICE IN VIDEO: “Stay back!” This is the story of Russia’s assault on Mariupol. A strategic port city in southeastern Ukraine. These are the interviews, videos, photos, and 3D models that Human Rights Watch, SITU Research, and Truth Hounds used to reconstruct the struggles residents faced as Russian forces took over the city. This is Mariupol after Russian forces occupied the city. Russia’s full-scale military invasion of Ukraine began on February 24, 2022, as its forces attacked Ukrainian positions defending Mariupol. The city was pounded by explosive weapons for weeks. Much of Mariupol was seriously damaged in the Russian assault. Human Rights Watch and SITU Research conducted a detailed damage assessment of the destruction. While satellite imagery shows damage to rooftops, our modeling reveals more. We used over 850 videos and photos of buildings that we found online and verified, in addition to satellite imagery, to capture the extent of the devastation in the city center. Buildings with damage are seen here in red. Our analysis shows that 93% of the 477 high-rise apartment buildings in this area were damaged. Some of this imagery could help prove war crimes. Our focus was Mariupol’s main avenue, Myru or “Peace” Avenue, and the immediate surrounding area, the city center, which includes cultural hubs, hospitals, schools, and universities. And this is Mariupol before. DMYTRO KULYK: “It’s [was] a town with about half a million inhabitants.” HALYNA MOROKHOVSKA: “Recently, it had blossomed. We had new parks. The city center was well-developed.” NATALIIA TKACHENKO: “In general, the city was becoming modern and vibrant. For Russian forces, Mariupol was a strategic prize. It would give them control of one of Ukraine’s largest ports and a land corridor between occupied Crimea to the west and areas Russia had been controlling in Donbas, to the northeast. As the attack on the city began, tens of thousands of civilians huddled in shelters and basements to escape Russian bombing and shelling. Many people we spoke to relocated to the city center, which they believed to be safe. DENYS SHEVTSOV: “Most people moved in all directions. To a bomb shelter, to a basement. Some stayed in their apartments. But we believe it isn’t safe to stay in the apartment... We are in the basement now. This is our makeshift bomb shelter. These are the conditions we live in. About 40 people live here with us, about 15 children.” DENYS SHEVTSOV: “This morning, our yard was heavily shelled. Basically, all the cars were destroyed, and the windows.” Russian forces used a variety of explosive weapons in Mariupol including aerial bombs and ground-launched artillery, such as projectiles and rockets. The use of these weapons in populated areas is the greatest threat to civilians in contemporary armed conflicts and heightens the risk of unlawfully indiscriminate attacks. HALYNA MOROKHOVSKA: “An aerial bomb hit the dormitory. My face was torn up. I had cuts everywhere. My arm, chest, stomach, legs.” VOICE IN VIDEO: “It’s coming from that side.” VOICE #2 IN VIDEO: Come into the entryway... DMYTRO KULYK: “Dead bodies became an ordinary sight for me. We were told that seven people died that one day. Two children and five adults. Under the laws of war, parties have an obligation to do everything feasible to minimize harm to civilians. These are the maternity and pediatric units of a hospital that Russian forces bombed on March 9. At least three people were killed, including a pregnant woman and her baby, who was stillborn after the attack. Seventeen people were injured. In this case, witnesses told us that there were no Ukrainian military personnel, vehicles, or installations close by at the time. A deliberate strike on a hospital not being used to carry out attacks harmful to the enemy, is a war crime. Humanitarian volunteer Mykhailo Puryshev was about 400 meters from the hospital by Pryazovskysi State Technical University. MYKHAILO PURYSHEV: “Everyone is very, very afraid. Everyone is very afraid. You hear that, don’t you? The rumbling. It’s Mariupol... “ MYKHAILO PURYSHEV: “I heard an airplane approaching… And I shouted “Airplanes!” and we all ran... “ MYKHAILO PURYSHEV: Fucking hell! Go down! MYKHAILO PURYSHEV: “When I went outside, I saw the full horror of what had happened.” VOICE IN VIDEO: “Was it a mine?” MYKHAILO PURYSHEV: “No, an airstrike most likely.” VOICE IN VIDEO: “Grandma...” MYKHAILO PURYSHEV: “Drag her, drag her!” At least two people were killed on the spot. Witnesses said there were no military targets at the university. An attack that is not directed at a specific military objective is a laws-of-war violation and a possible war crime. Numerous images posted on social media and given to us by witnesses helped us assess the damage to parts of the university campus. The fighting damaged vital infrastructure, knocking out the city’s electricity grid, which in turn cut essential services. DENYS SHEVTSOV: “So, we’re left without gas, without water, without power. We are absolutely isolated from civilization. No internet, no updates. Nothing.” DMYTRO KULYK: ‘’If you want to wash your hands, this is the only way. So we pick up snow, put it in a bucket. Then we put the bucket on an open fire and boil the water.” DENYS SHEVTSOV: “Here is our field stove. We live like in the Stone Age in caves. This is what I call really living it up during the war. Bacon, pasta. And shells are flying overhead. As long as they don’t make barbecue out of us.” DENYS SHEVTSOV: “The city was destroyed. And every day, the city was getting destroyed more and more.” DMYTRO KULYK: “I am telling you, day after day, these explosions became more frequent. Every day, they got louder and more hellish.” We used satellite imagery, photos, and videos to track damage across Mariupol. We found 86 out of 89 schools and universities were damaged, and all the city’s 19 hospital campuses. The damage to these facilities devastated health care and education across the city. VAAGN MNATSAKANIAN: “Every day we thought about when we could leave. But we realized that the city was completely closed off and there was no way to leave.” In the first two weeks of March, multiple attempts to provide safe passage out of the city failed in the face of Russian obstruction. Arbitrary restrictions on the evacuation of civilians or the delivery of aid would amount to a violation of the laws of war and possible war crimes. In early March, hundreds of people had gathered at the Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theater, for shelter and in the hope of getting safe passage out of Mariupol. Nataliia Tkachenko arrived on March 12 after an attack destroyed her home. NATALIIA TKACHENKO: “They gave us a bit of food. A soup in the afternoon, a cup of boiled water in the morning and evening. It was something. At home there was no water, no food, nothing. It was dark, there was no electricity. It was impossible to use the toilets. There was no water. Nobody was cleaning them. It was a nightmare. No one was walking around the theater. Only kids were running around because kids will be kids. They were playing and laughing.” At least 500 people were sheltering at the theater on March 16. Giant Cyrillic letters spelling “children” were painted on the ground in front and at the back of the theater. These words were clearly visible on satellite imagery. Nataliia was bringing water inside, by the main entrance. NATALIIA TKACHENKO: “And at that moment, the bomb struck. The shockwave hit us. Everything was flying around. Cement got in my mouth, eyes, everywhere. Shards of wood and glass. I couldn’t hear anything except the humming, the cracking.” Satellite imagery, videos, and photographs of the theater show that the central part of the roof and the northern and southern walls were destroyed. At least 15 people were killed and the total number has not been determined. Given the absence of a military target at the theater, it appears that Russian forces deliberately attacked civilians, which would amount to a war crime. Those responsible for war crimes in Mariupol should be held to account. By reviewing official Russian government statements, social media posts, and obituaries of Russian soldiers, we identified 17 military units that took part in the 2022 siege of Mariupol. Considering the extent of the military operation, the highest levels of Russian command likely knew the situation in the city and were involved in the planning, execution, and coordination of the actions of the Russian and Russia-affiliated forces. Those responsible for the conduct of Russian forces during the siege of Mariupol include President Vladimir Putin, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu, and Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, Valery Gerasimov, among others. As the battle for the city raged, food and other basic supplies ran low. VOICE IN VIDEO: Wait. Step back a little. MIKHAILO PURYSHEV: You may crush others! Please! MIKHAILO PURYSHEV: “The worst problem was probably not with food or heat, but with medication. And people were just dying because there was none. The people who suffered the most were older people and children.” Thousands were killed in attacks. Others died from health complications due to lack of medicine and clean water. MIKHAILO PURYSHEV: “Mariupol is a big, big, big, big cemetery. There were a lot of people left under the rubble. So it remains to be seen how many people died there.” TETIANA BURAK: “We were horrified at what we saw because there were burnt multi-story houses and bodies in the streets.” HALYNA MOROKHOVSKA: “It was impossible to count them because people were buried under the debris, on the roads.” Many were buried in a makeshift trench grave in the Old City Cemetery. VAAGN MNATSAKANIAN: “We filled one trench [with bodies] completely. There were about 200 bodies.” These bodies from the trench grave and many other makeshift graves across the city were exhumed and reburied in the city's cemeteries when Russian forces took over. We estimated the minimum number of people killed by fighting or who died of poor conditions. To do so, we counted graves in two types of burial sites. In some cases, we counted individual graves visible in high resolution satellite imagery. We also estimated the number of bodies buried in trench-type graves. We verified footage at two cemeteries which allowed us to count the plaques, sticks with a small wooden panel, in a given area. We then used this sample size to extrapolate to other parts of the cemeteries. In five cemeteries in and around Mariupol between March 2022 and February 2023, we estimated at least 10,284 new burials. We do not know how many of these people were civilians. Considering average annual death rates in Mariupol, we calculated more than 8,000 people would not have died were it not for the attack on the city. This is likely a significant underestimation of the total number of dead, as many graves contained multiple bodies and the remains of others were likely buried in the rubble and taken away during demolition efforts. With the city still under Russian occupation and much of the physical evidence destroyed, the full death toll may never be known. DENYS SHEVSTOV: “Look around. What is going on, what’s happening in our Mariupol. It’s completely destroyed. Completely gone, just disappeared. Just nothing. Just ruins.” With attacks by Russian forces continuing, tens of thousands of residents found their way out of the city at great personal risk beginning in mid-March. DENYS SHEVSTOV: “We were hoping war suddenly will stop and finally we realized this is not going to happen, we decided to run away. We hope we will be fine but overall, it’s been horrible, just horrible.” By mid May 2022, Russian forces had full control of the city. The bombs might have stopped now but the city’s tragedy is far from over. The psychological effects of the fighting, displacement, and the losses that Mariupol’s residents experienced will reverberate for years to come. DMYTRO KULYK: “Mariupol is a city that has become hell.” TETIANA BURAK: “People should know what is happening.” VAAGN MNATSAKANIAN: “We realized that no matter how much we want our pre-war life, our city, our friends, our loved ones, our apartments, we won’t get them back” This footage is from October 2022. Since occupying the city, Russian forces are demolishing buildings and constructing new ones. Russia is also replacing Ukrainian culture with its own. For justice to be done, the survivors of Mariupol need reparations for their losses. The loss of their homes, their loved ones, their livelihoods, and the impact on their mental health. Russian officials and military commanders credibly implicated in war crimes committed in the city need to be brought to justice.

The Mission provides strategic advice and practical support for specific reform measures in accordance with EU standards and international principles of good governance and human rights, including in support of Ukraine’s EU accession-related commitments. In 2022, EUAM Ukraine’s mandate was adjusted to address Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, most notably to facilitate the investigation and prosecution of international crimes. On 14 May 2024, the EU Member States, through a decision by the EU Council of Ministers, reinforced the Mission and intensified its efforts in Ukraine, extending the mandate from 1 June 2024 to 31 May 2027. Within the current mandate, EUAM works closely with its Ukrainian partners to assist them in implementing the Overarching Strategic Plan for the Reform of the Entire Law Enforcement Sector (OAS) and its Action Plan, as well as other relevant reforms across the civilian security sector. With the liberation of parts of Ukraine from Russian occupation, the Mission supports the Ukrainian authorities in re-establishing government functions and the rule of law there. EUAM Ukraine contributes to a broader international effort aimed at ensuring accountability for international crimes committed during the full-scale invasion, including by building Ukraine’s capacity to investigate and prosecute them. The Mission is also mandated to support the Ukrainian authorities in improving border management, not least through facilitating closer cooperation between involved agencies. Strengthening Ukraine’s capacities in Integrated Border Management is crucial for the country’s EU integration and for preventing and combating border-related and transnational crime, such as all forms of smuggling and trafficking in human beings, small arms and light weapons (SALW). Our Priorities The Mission has four priorities through which it supports the reform of Ukraine’s civilian security sector and builds the capacity to respond to wartime challenges and post-war related needs. Our Cross-Cutting Measures EUAM Ukraine ensures that principles of Good Governance, Anti-Corruption, Human Rights and Gender Equality are integrated as cross-cutting measures into all Mission activities. Our Lines of Operation EUAM Ukraine’s mandate is implemented through three lines of operation: Strategic advice on civilian security sector reform, in particular, to develop strategic documents and legislation; Operational support for the implementation of reforms through capacity building, training, and practical support for the civilian security sector; Cooperation and coordination focus on supporting Ukrainian partners in developing cohesive and effective coordination mechanisms, both at national and international levels.",CREDIBLE

The guidelines authorize the use of trials in absentia and even the death penalty for anyone asserting Taiwan’s independence. The People’s Republic of China since its founding in 1949 has never ruled Taiwan and has no jurisdiction over Taiwan, which is democratically governed. The guidelines regarding Taiwanese “separatists” are stark reminders that the Chinese government routinely threatens Taiwan and its 23 million inhabitants and has expanded its aggressive efforts to stifle their basic freedoms. China’s 2005 Anti-Secession Law made vague threats of using “other measures” against “Taiwanese secessionist forces” without specifying what constituted “secessionist.” The new guidelines make a criminal offense anything related to Taiwanese independence, including “establishing a ‘Taiwan Independence’ separatist organization,” “promoting Taiwan’s entrance into international organizations,” and deviating from the Chinese narrative of Taiwan “in fields such as education, culture, history, or news media.” Other overly broad offenses include “conduct seeking to separate Taiwan from China” and “otherwise actively participat[ing]” in Taiwanese “separatist organizations.” The guidelines threaten in absentia trials with no statute of limitations for those who evade being tried. They also do not differentiate between Taiwanese and foreign nationals. The new guidelines also threaten the death penalty for “crimes” considered “especially serious or … vile.” The Chinese government carries out the most executions in the world, although the exact number remains a state secret. Human Rights Watch opposes the death penalty in all circumstances because of its inherent cruelty. Taiwan has raised its alert levels for Taiwanese nationals traveling to China, citing recent cases of arbitrary arrests, detention, and interrogations. These new guidelines are likely to have a further chilling effect on the approximately 150,000 Taiwanese nationals living in China, for whom self-censorship is routine. The new court guidelines are the Chinese government’s latest effort to control people’s right to freedom of expression beyond its borders. Everyone has fundamental rights and freedoms, including those who believe in or advocate for Taiwanese independence.",CREDIBLE

We identified several of them. Last week, the bodies of the first Russians killed in Libya’s civil war started arriving back home for burial. Officially, Russia isn’t part of the fighting in North Africa, which has been ongoing for several years now. In reality, however, Russian combatants have been providing massive support to one side in the conflict, in exchange for which Moscow’s Libyan allies have promised “oil, railways, and highways.” Meduza investigative journalist Liliya Yapparova has learned that an infamous Russian private military company has suffered dozens of casualties in Libya. She also found some of the mercenaries’ names despite efforts to keep that information secret: even the mercenaries’ bodies are being withheld. In April of 2019, the Libyan military commander Khalifa Haftar moved his forces to the west, significantly escalating the country’s eight-year civil war. Haftar, whose army had already taken control of the eastern part of the country, was advancing to fight the UN-recognized Government of National Accord, which is also supported by Turkey, Qatar, and a U.S.-led coalition. Signs of significant Russian involvement in Haftar’s advance soon reached the press. On September 9, a Twitter user wrote that seven fighters from the Wagner PMC had been killed in an air raid outside Tripoli. Al Jazeera subsequently cited government sources who raised that number to eight. Bloomberg wrote on September 25 that “more than 100 mercenaries from the Wagner group” had “arrived at a forward base in Libya in the first week of September to support eastern strongman Khalifa Haftar’s assault on the capital Tripoli.” Now, Meduza has learned that as many as 35 Russian fighters from the Wagner PMC have been killed in the Libyan conflict. Five of the PMC’s mercenaries and commanders as well as a handful of FSB and MVD veterans with ties to the company spoke about the casualties. They indicated that the fighters in question were from Russia’s Krasnodar, Sverdlovsk, and Murmansk regions. While the families of the fighters allegedly killed in Libya have lost contact with their loved ones, neither the Russian government nor Wagner itself has formally notified the families of any combat deaths. This is contrary to the PMC’s typical practice, which is to send death certificates and any military decorations to the relatives of combatants who are killed. Trading bodies for oil Khalifa Haftar first requested Russian military and diplomatic support in 2015. A source familiar with that relationship told Meduza that the Libyan field marshal reached out to Russian officials after admiring the country’s operations in the Syrian war. Haftar warned that his planned takeover of Libya would be bloody, but Meduza’s source said he promised “oil, railways, highways, anything you want” in exchange for troops, weaponry, and UN vetoes that would help him reach his goal. At first, the source recalled, Russia’s Defense Ministry was skeptical of Haftar’s proposal. The field marshal was not invited to Moscow, where he had previously met with high-ranked military officials and with purported Wagner PMC owner Evgeny Prigozhin. Instead, Russian government representatives held negotiations with Haftar and his UN-backed opponents out of the spotlight in the Chechen capital of Grozny. “It was important to us back then that there wouldn’t be headlines like ‘Russia continues Middle East expansion: Libya is up next after Syria,’” Meduza’s source explained. That didn’t prevent media sources from reporting that several dozen Russian trainers and special forces troops were sent to Libya in 2018 or that Russian mercenaries had increasingly begun protecting oil interests connected to Haftar. As Haftar’s advance on Tripoli approached, photographs of Russian combatants in Libya began appearing frequently on social media, and The Telegraph reported a total mercenary presence of about 300 troops. Multiple combat veterans as well as Higher School of Economics (HSE) expert Grigory Lukyanov confirmed to Meduza that Russian fighters were actively involved in preparatory missions and supply line defense in the early months of 2019. Another source close to the Russian-Libyan negotiations added that while Haftar continues to benefit from Russian support, he is not necessarily reliant on it: The field marshal also enjoys backing from Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The strike The September airstrike was a turning point for Russia’s involvement in the Libyan conflict. Andrey Chuprygin, a Libya specialist and senior lecturer at the HSE’s World Economy and International Affairs Department, told Meduza that the strike doesn’t appear to have been accidental: It hit the exact area in Tripoli’s suburbs where the Wagner troops were staying. “They’re not sitting in the desert out there,” Chuprygin said. “They’re fighting in populated areas.” Reports of Russian casualties in Libya first reached the Sverdlovsk region on Saturday, September 28. One veteran of the war in eastern Ukraine who was close with two of those mercenaries told Meduza, “They were hit in an airstrike on the frontline. They were just standing there in a military formation, and something went wrong, as they say.” Another Wagner PMC fighter who spoke with Meduza said he had discussed the details of the attack with two mid-level commanders who were caught in the strike. The soldier explained that the two squads that came under attack were supposed to lead an assault on Tripoli. However, he added, how they were meant to do so without heavy weapons support was a mystery to him. The same source indicated that the airstrike was carried out by the air force of the Government National Accord, potentially as a preemptive warning against further Russian involvement. According to Bloomberg, the UN-backed government is currently receiving aerial support from the Turkish Air Force. The dead The Donbas veteran whose friends were killed in the attack provided Meduza with additional details about how the identities of Wagner’s casualties became known. Reports of the strike, he said, reached Russia directly from the front lines: Maxim Khlopin, the director of the Ural branch of the Donbas Union of Volunteers, called a Wagner commander who had seen the attack firsthand. That commander said two of the Russian casualties were Artyom “Hulk” Nevyantsev and Ignat “Benya” Borichev. Borichev’s brother had previously died while working as a personal bodyguard for former Ukrainian separatist commander Alexander “Batman” Bednov. Bednov was assassinated in the same attack. Khlopin confirmed to Meduza that he had been informed of Nevyantsev’s and Borichev’s deaths. He also predicted that there would be more Russian casualties in Libya going forward. Russia’s Defense Ministry did not respond to Meduza’s request for comment by publication time. Online information about Artyom “Hulk” Nevyantsev is sparse. However, he is listed on the Ukrainian doxxing website Mirotvorets, which identifies him as a 38-year-old Yekaterinburg native and a veteran of the Second Chechen War. The website alleges that Nevyantsev began working as a military intelligence officer in eastern Ukraine in the winter of 2014, before the area became a conflict zone, and then served in what might have been one of the Wagner PMC’s first two tactical groups in the region. The facial recognition tool FindClone turned up multiple social media photographs of Nevyantsev wearing military uniforms in what appears to be eastern Ukraine. FindClone searches also unearthed several photos of Nevyantsev with his wife, Oksana Chumakova, and their child. When Meduza wrote to Chumakova, she responded with a voice message: “I don’t know where he is,” she said. “You’re all writing this stuff to me now, and I don’t understand. Christ, is this some kind of prank or something? I don’t know where he is, or what’s happening to him. I can’t go getting upset, but here I am getting these messages all day long.” Her tone was anxious. Chumakova declined to say who else has asked her about her husband. However, she affirmed that she has received no formal notice of his status. Chumakova explained that her husband’s trip is classified and that even he did not know where he was being deployed when he left home. Ignat Borichev, whom Meduza’s sources named as the second Yekaterinburg native killed in the September airstrike, has a stronger online presence: In 2015, he granted an interview to the website E1 when it reported on the funeral for his brother, who was buried with military honors. Both Borichevs had been guarding Alexander Bednov at the time of the separatist commander’s assassination, but Ignat survived the attack. His page on the social network VKontakte is closed, and his mother and friends did not respond to questions Meduza sent them over social media. One more potential casualty of the airstrike, a Russian fighter named Vadim Bekshenev, came to light after the 3rd Tripoli Infantry Company (which is loyal to the Government of National Accord) published a video of the attack’s aftermath on September 25. Two days after the video was posted, Russian open-source investigative journalists at the Conflict Intelligence Team reported that a Sberbank card issued to Bekshenev was visible in the footage. One Wagner source whose acquantances were injured on the Libyan front lines said that he had known Bekshenev as a platoon commander in the Wagner PMC’s sixth detachment. The source said the commander is currently considered missing in action. Meduza obtained less complete information about three other combatants. One, whose first name is Denis and whose callsign is Vector, was the first to have his remains brought back to his home village to be buried. Another mercenary whose callsign is “Academic” also died; his body was transported home to Murmansk. A third fighter was seriously injured and transferred to St. Petersburg for medical treatment. According to a Wagner PMC source, that fighter was a first unit commander with the callsign “Ratibor.” One of the Wagner mercenaries photographed at a December 2016 Kremlin reception was named Alexander “Ratibor” Kuznetsov. Corpses in limbo A broader survey of sources familiar with the Russian mercenary presence in Libya pointed to a total death count of 30 Russian fighters or more. One source located in Yekaterinburg who knew some of the fighters killed said that 15 of the casualties are natives of the Sverdlovsk region, where Yekaterinburg is the capital. That source put the total number of combatants killed at 35. A different source, the current Wagner mercenary who is in contact with fighters wounded in the September airstrike, said there are 15 confirmed deaths among the combatants, with six of those individuals coming from the federal district that contains Yekaterinburg. Three sources added that some of those killed were native to the Krasnodar region. Meanwhile, a source in the Rostov area who formerly managed a Russian PMC told Meduza that the Russian death toll in the Libyan strike was 20. He argued that 20 casualties would be a small price to pay for capturing Tripoli, which would effectively grant control over the country to Khalifa Haftar. Some casualty estimates were even lower: An anonymous source in Russia’s Defense Ministry unofficially confirmed to Meduza that Russian mercenaries are present in Libya but claimed that only one of them has been confirmed dead. The source argued that even that death was accidental and that Russian fighters’ activities in Libya are limited to training exercises. An individual close to the Wagner PMC’s management disagreed. He said the number of corpses set to be returned to Russia is roughly 30. However, he indicated that they will not be repatriated until late October. When asked about the condition of the bodies, the source said, “You don’t want to know.” Summary by Hilah Kohen and Kevin Rothrock Meduza survived 2024 thanks to its readers!

It was both a show of strength and support for Matteo Salvini. On Sunday, leaders of political forces within the EU Parliament’s far-right nationalist 'Patriots for Europe' group came to the 36th annual gathering of the League party in Pontida. As they took to the stage under the slogan 'defending borders is not a crime', they stood by the Italian party leader's side, who is facing six years in prison in the ongoing Open Arms trial. Surrounded by fellow League party members, Salvini attacked Italian prosecutors for charging him after he refused to allow 147 migrants to disembark in Italy when he was Interior Minister in 2019. Palermo prosecutors accuse Salvini of dereliction of duty and kidnapping for having refused to allow the Open Arms ship and its passengers to dock in Italy for 19 days. During the standoff, some of the migrants threw themselves overboard in desperation as the captain pleaded for a safe, close port. The remaining 89 people onboard were finally permitted to disembark in Lampedusa by a court order on August 20. Salvini said, ""nobody can stop the sacred alliance of the European people that is born today in Pontida. I love you all and I promise: I don’t and will never give up."" In attendance were other right-wing European politicians from the President of Portugal's CHEGA party, André Ventura, to Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. Migration topped the agenda, along with the call for Europe to change its course. ""Hungary celebrates Salvini as a hero because he closed the borders and protected Italian homes. He needs an award, not to be put on trial,"" Orbán said on stage. ""Europe should be able to take clear decisions as Matteo Salvini did,"" said vice-president of Austria's Freedom Party, Marlene Svazek. José Antonio Fúster, spokesperson for the Spanish party Vox, said that an alliance of ""European patriots"" is the only solution. ""Together we are stronger,"" he said. Jordan Bardella, the president of France's National Rally sent a video message, as did Brazil's former president, Jair Bolsonaro. But the Pontida meeting was also a chance for the League party leader to rally support and counter his party's declining ratings. Salvini has already launched a petition in his defence which has garnered 100,000 signatures, with more expected to be collected in Pontida. Supporters who signed the petition were given a special membership card from the League party. ""Signatures help Italians understand what should be done when migrants arrive in Italy,"" said one man. ""I am not saying we are being invaded but we are going through critical times and Salvini did the right thing and did it well."" Whether or not Salvini's support for Patriots for Europe, the third-largest group in the EU Parliament, could distance him from Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who heads the European Conservatives and Reformists group, is too early to say.",CREDIBLE

The EU treaties – the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union - provide the broad operational framework for the EU’s main institutions and indicate that representative democracy will be the form of government upon which the EU is based. The Treaty on European Union makes it clear that: - citizens are directly represented at EU level in the European Parliament - EU countries are represented in a twofold manner: - in the European Council by their heads of state or government - in the Council of the EU by their governments (“themselves democratically accountable either to their national Parliaments, or to their citizens”) The Lisbon Treaty (2007) introduced several notable amendments – including, for example, creating a permanent, full-time President for the European Council, and strengthening the European Parliament’s role and powers. Representation EU citizens are central to the EU’s democratic process and they all have a right to vote in the European elections. In much the same way that they make their voices heard in their own countries by voting in national elections, they also directly or indirectly influence European elections and appointments. The European Parliament, European Council and Council of the EU are composed, respectively, of elected representatives and members of governments from every EU country. And the EU largely replicates the parliamentary control processes of its 27 member democracies in its own democratic system of government. For example, the European Commission needs the express confidence of the European Parliament to formally take office at the beginning of its term. Administration Like governments worldwide, the EU executive is supported in its tasks by a civil service, entry to which is open to all EU citizens via recruitment competitions run by the European Personnel Selection Office. EU institutions The EU institutions have different selection procedures for their leadership. European Parliament Composition: currently 720 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), voted for directly by EU citizens, according largely to national electoral laws and traditions in each EU country. MEPs may join political groups within the Parliament, based on their political affinities. Those who don’t are considered ‘non-attached’ MEPs. EU citizens elect a new European Parliament every 5 years. The last European elections took place on 6-9 June 2024. Function: as the ‘co-legislator’, it decides on new legislation proposed by the European Commission – on most issues on an equal footing with the Council of the EU. It also votes on new trade agreements and scrutinises the EU institutions and how the EU budget is spent. Supported by its own administration composed of civil servants. Powers of appointment - Votes for its own President - post held for a 2.5 year term, renewable once - nominated by political groups or a minimum of 38 MEPs - election held by secret ballot - maximum of 4 ballots - candidate must win an absolute majority of votes cast, i.e. 50% plus one. - Elects its own Vice-Presidents, quaestors, committee and delegation chairs and vice-chairs - Elects the President of the European Commission - Parliament must approve the new Commission President, proposed by the European Council, by an absolute majority (half of all MEPs, plus one). - Vets Commissioners - each Commissioner-designate (proposed by the Council, in agreement with the President-elect of the European Commission) must appear before parliamentary committees in their prospective fields of responsibility - negative evaluations can result in a candidate’s withdrawal from the process. A new candidate for Commissioner must then be put forward for scrutiny - Approves European Commission (the Commissioners, the President and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy) - by a single vote of consent (they are then officially appointed by the European Council) - Has supervisory and control powers over the other EU institutions, holding them to account. It can for instance adopt a vote of no-confidence to censure and ultimately dismiss the Commission.

For example, when agricultural policies are on the agenda, the meetings are attended by each country’s agriculture minister. Supported by the Council administration, composed of civil servants. Function: ministers voice the views of the EU’s member governments and meet to negotiate and adopt EU laws and coordinate EU policies. Leadership The Council of the EU does not have an individual president. Instead it is chaired by a ‘presidency’, which rotates among EU countries every 6 months. The one exception is the field of foreign affairs and security policy – this is led by a standing official, the High Representative, supported by the European External Action Service (EEAS). Configurations The Council of the EU is a single legal entity, but it meets in 10 different ‘configurations’, depending on the subject being discussed. The presidency chairs meetings held at every level within the Council of the EU. Its role is to ensure the continuity of the EU’s work in this forum. The EU country holding the presidency works closely with the 2 countries that will succeed it in the chair. These groups of 3, known as “trios”, draw up a common agenda that will cover the main issues to be addressed by the Council of the EU over an 18-month period. Based on the agreed agenda, each country determines its own, more detailed, 6-month work programme, to implement when it assumes the presidency. The European Council and Council of the European Union are supported by the General Secretariat of the Council. Decision-making in the Council of the EU More on the Presidency of the Council of the EU Current Presidency of the Council of the EU European Commission Composition: Political leadership is provided by a team of 27 members (one from each EU country) including the Commission President, who decides who is responsible for which policy area. They are supported by a civil service. Function: politically independent executive body that proposes new laws, manages EU policies according to powers defined in the treaties, implements the EU budget and enforces EU law. Leadership The European Commission is led by its President and the 26 Commissioners, one per country. President The Commission President is elected for a 5-year term by the European Parliament, following the European elections. The European Council (EU heads of state or government) proposes a presidential candidate to the Parliament. Because the choice of candidate must take into account the European election results, the proposed candidate generally comes from the largest political group in the Parliament. The Parliament has to approve the new Commission President by an absolute majority (half of all MEPs, plus one). Once approved, the European Council officially appoints the new President. If the candidate fails to secure the approval of the European Parliament, the European Council must propose a new candidate within 1 month. Commissioners The President-elect allocates policy portfolios to the candidate Commissioners, one from each EU country. Commissioners carry out their duties for the Commission independently of the national governments of the countries from which they come. The Commissioners-designate must then appear before the parliamentary committee responsible for their portfolio, to be evaluated on their suitability for the position. Once all 26 Commissioners-designate have been approved (Commissioners-designate may withdraw if they do not receive a positive evaluation), they, along with the President-elect and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, have to be approved in a single vote of consent by the European Parliament. The European Council formally appoints all the Commissioners to their respective positions, acting by a qualified majority. European Commission leadership appointment process How Parliament votes the European Commission into office Infographic - Election of the European Commission President European Commission leadership Court of Justice of the European Union Composition: The Court of Justice of the European Union consists of 2 courts: - Court of Justice – rules on requests for preliminary rulings from national courts, certain actions for annulment, infringement proceedings brought against EU countries for failing to adhere to EU law, and appeals. - General Court – rules on actions for annulment brought by individuals, companies and, in some cases, EU governments. In practice, it operates as the general administrative court of the EU and deals with many different fields of EU law, including competition law, state aid (government support), trade, agriculture, intellectual property and restrictive measures adopted by the Council against individuals and non/EU countries. Function: interprets EU law to make sure it is applied in the same way in all EU countries, and settles legal disputes between national governments and EU institutions. It can also, in certain circumstances, be used by individuals, companies or organisations to take action against an EU institution, if they feel it has infringed their rights. Members: Each judge and advocate general is appointed for a renewable 6-year term, by common accord of the governments of EU countries, after consulting a panel of respected lawyers who give an opinion on prospective candidates’ suitability. In each Court, the judges select a president from among themselves, who serves a renewable term of 3 years. - Court of Justice – 1 judge from each EU country, plus 11 advocates general, who assist the Court by presenting, with complete impartiality and independence, an ‘opinion’ in the cases assigned to them - General Court – 2 judges from each EU country European Central Bank Executive Board Consisting of the Bank’s President and Vice-President and the 4 other members, the Board is appointed by the European Council by qualified majority voting. The Council makes this decision following a Council recommendation and having consulted the European Parliament and the Bank's Governing Council (the 6 members of the Executive Board, plus central bank governors from the 19 euro area (“eurozone”) countries). Infographic - Appointment of the ECB Executive Board European Court of Auditors This is an EU institution that operates as a collegiate body of 27 members, one from each EU country. The members are nominated by their national government and appointed (for a renewable term of 6 years) by the Council, after consulting the European Parliament. Members are required to perform their duties independently of national or other interests, representing the general interest of the EU. The Court of Auditors is headed by a president, who is elected for a renewable term of 3 years by the members from among their number. Other appointments As with the EU institutions, senior level appointments (e.g., Directors, Presidents) in other EU bodies are regulated by specific and detailed rules, which have their basis in the EU treaties. Some of these rules are applicable to all EU bodies, while others are internal requirements for specific institutions. The executive directors of the EU’s decentralised agencies are usually appointed by the management board of the agency concerned, on the basis of a shortlist drawn up by the Commission, following an open selection procedure. Occasionally the appointing authority is the Commission or the Council of the EU. In some cases, the selected candidate has to undergo a hearing by the European Parliament before being formally appointed.",CREDIBLE
https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/russian-defector-killed-in-spain-may-have-been-eliminated-by-ukrainian-services/,https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-02-22/gunmen-sent-by-moscow-killed-defector-sheltering-in-alicante-spanish-intelligence-services-say.html,2024-02-22,"Gunmen sent by Moscow killed defector sheltering in Alicante, Spanish intelligence services say Spain’s Foreign Ministry will send a strong response if the involvement of Russian secret services in the crime is proven Spanish intelligence services have no doubt that the long hand of the Kremlin is behind an unprecedented crime: the assassination in Alicante of Maxim Kuzminov, the Russian captain who defected last August and crossed over to Ukraine with his Mi8 combat helicopter. Publicly, the Spanish government has been very cautious regarding who was possibly responsible for the murder. “We have to let the Civil Guard [a national law enforcement force] do its job and for the investigation to progress,” said government spokesperson Pilar Alegría on Tuesday. However, diplomatic sources recognize that, although they are still waiting to gather enough information, it is a “very serious” matter. If the involvement of the Russian authorities is confirmed, they add, Spain will give a “forceful response.” It is not the first time that a dissident has been killed in Western Europe (the most famous case is that of Alexander Litvinenko, poisoned with plutonium in 2006 in the United Kingdom), but it is the first time that it has been done on Spanish soil. Contrary to other occasions, Moscow has not stayed in the shadows. It has shown its satisfaction. When the victim’s identity had not yet been confirmed, Russian media were the first to report the news of Kuzminov’s death. They said the Russian pilot suffered from problems with alcohol and drugs, and that he had become an “uncomfortable and dangerous witness” for Kyiv. After the news was confirmed by Ukraine, the head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), Sergey Naryshkin, said Tuesday that the victim was “a criminal traitor” and “a moral corpse” since he defected from his country. Moscow has been publicizing his murder because it serves as an example, according to the sources consulted. It is not only a warning to those who might be tempted to follow his example (Kyiv rewarded the defector with $500,000), but also to avenge the pilot’s two companions: two lieutenants who were unaware of his escape plan were shot down by the Ukrainians when they tried to flee, after Kuzminov landed at a military base near Kharkiv. The deceased, the navigator and the mechanic, were decorated as heroes by the Russian Army, while the pilot was prosecuted for treason. Last October, Russian public television claimed, showing three alleged GRU members, that they had been ordered to kill the defector. “He will not live long enough to stand trial,” said one of them. The only doubt experts have is whether the operation was the work of the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), whose head justified the assassination; of the Federal Security Service (FSB), heir of the KGB; or of the Military Intelligence Service (GRU), since Kuzminov was a captain and, therefore, under its jurisdiction. Sources in the Spanish intelligence services admit, however, that it is very difficult for the investigation to find evidence of the involvement of any of them. They assume that the crime was committed by gunmen (probably hired killers) from outside Spain, who by now are abroad; the body, with half a dozen gunshot wounds, was found on February 13 in the garage of the residential complex where he lived, in Villajoyosa (Alicante), although his death was not made public until Monday. After shooting him, the murderers ran over him with a car, which was found burned in the nearby town of El Campello. At first, the Civil Guard believed that it was a settling of scores between criminal gangs. Intelligence experts believe that the Russian Embassy in Spain has most likely stayed on the sidelines of the operation to avoid being implicated. Although some 20 SVR or GRU agents were stationed at the Russian delegation in Madrid with diplomatic status — most of them were expelled in April 2022, after the invasion of Ukraine —, the sources consulted do not believe they had any direct involvement and argue the crime was committed by professional hitmen. Beyond the material authors, the crime required a previous surveillance operation: the Russian agents would have had to verify the identity of the victim and carry out a follow-up to know his schedules and habits. Those familiar with the Moscow secret services say that they frequently resort, in order to achieve their objectives, to the collaboration of Russian citizens living in Spain (there are more than 80,000) and of mafia organizations, to which they offer favorable treatment. The decision to settle in a residential complex where the majority of the population is Russian and Ukrainian was, in the opinion of the sources consulted, a mistake. Alicante is the Spanish province with the largest Russian population (17,500). If Kuzminov thought he could go unnoticed among the 600 Russians and more than 300 Ukrainians registered in Villajoyosa (according to the 2022 census), they were in fact the ones who could more easily recognize him or suspect that he was Russian. He had false papers, in the name of a 33-year-old Ukrainian citizen, but no protection, despite the threats made against him. Government sources explain that the more than 4,000 Ukrainian military personnel who have received training in Spain and the dozens of wounded treated at the Military Hospital of Zaragoza are under the protection of the Spanish authorities, but this was not the case for Kuzminov, who decided on his own to settle on the coast of Alicante. The Spanish secret services were not officially informed of his arrival, they add. The young captain — he was 28 years old when he defected — was not discreet either. According to some sources, the clue that led the Russian secret services to him was a call to his former girlfriend, who remains in Russia, inviting her to visit him. “He decided to move to Spain instead of staying here [in Ukraine]. As far as we know, he invited his ex-girlfriend to the place where he was and was later found shot to death,” Ukrainian intelligence sources told the website Ukrainska Pravda. In any case, the sources consulted stress that Spain cannot look the other way in the face of an event of unprecedented gravity. In February 2019, the North Korean Embassy in Madrid was raided, an operation that was attributed to an alleged North Korean dissident group behind which the CIA was implicated, as concluded then by Spain’s CNI intelligence services. On that occasion, there was no diplomatic protest, but no deaths either. On the other hand, Russian secret services have a long history of assassinations on European soil. In the aforementioned case of former KGB agent Litvinenko, who visited Spain and offered his services to the CNI, he was poisoned in 2006 in London with Polonium-210 by two Russian agents. The British justice system concluded that the crime was “probably” ordered by the head of the FSB and authorized by Putin. Two spies sent by Moscow were also accused by London of the attempted poisoning of former Russian agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury (UK) in 2018. Meanwhile, German judges sentenced a Russian spy to life imprisonment for the murder of a Chechen rebel in a park in central Berlin in 2019. Two other Chechen exiles were killed in Austria in 2009 and 2020. Until now, Moscow’s extrajudicial killings had left Spain on the sidelines.

Several gunmen have burst into a big concert hall in Moscow and fired automatic weapons at the crowd, injuring an unspecified number of people and setting a massive blaze in an apparent terror attack days after President Vladimir Putin cemented his grip on the country in a highly orchestrated electoral landslide. (AP Photo) MOSCOW (AP) — The suburban Moscow music hall where gunmen opened fire on concertgoers was a blackened, smoldering ruin Saturday as the death toll in the attack surpassed 130 and Russian authorities arrested four suspects. President Vladimir Putin claimed they were captured while fleeing to Ukraine. Kyiv strongly denied any involvement in Friday’s assault on the Crocus City Hall music venue in Krasnogorsk, and the Islamic State group’s Afghanistan affiliate claimed responsibility. Putin did not mention IS in his speech to the nation, and Kyiv accused him and other Russian politicians of falsely linking Ukraine to the assault to stoke fervor for Russia’s war in Ukraine, which recently entered its third year. U.S. intelligence officials confirmed the claim by the IS affiliate. “ISIS bears sole responsibility for this attack. There was no Ukrainian involvement whatsoever,” National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said in a statement. The U.S. shared information with Russia in early March about a planned terrorist attack in Moscow and issued a public warning to Americans in Russia, Watson said. Putin said authorities detained a total of 11 people in the attack, which also wounded more than 100. He called it “a bloody, barbaric terrorist act” and said Russian authorities captured the four suspects as they were trying to escape to Ukraine through a “window” prepared for them on the Ukrainian side of the border. Russian media broadcast videos that apparently showed the detention and interrogation of the suspects, including one who told the cameras he was approached by an unidentified assistant to an Islamic preacher via a messaging app and paid to take part in the raid. Russian news reports identified the gunmen as citizens of Tajikistan, a former Soviet republic in Central Asia that is predominantly Muslim and borders Afghanistan. Up to 1.5 million Tajiks have worked in Russia and many have Russian citizenship. Tajikistan’s foreign ministry, which denied initial Russian media reports that mentioned several other Tajiks allegedly involved in the raid, did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the arrests. Many Russian hard-liners called for a crackdown on Tajik migrants, but Putin appeared to reject the idea, saying “no force will be able to sow the poisonous seeds of discord, panic or disunity in our multi-ethnic society.” He declared Sunday a day of mourning and said additional security measures were imposed throughout Russia. The number of dead stood at 133, making the attack the deadliest in Russia in years. Authorities said the toll could still rise. The raid was a major embarrassment for the Russian leader and happened just days after he cemented his grip on the country for another six years in a vote that followed the harshest crackdown on dissent since the Soviet times. Some commentators on Russian social media questioned how authorities, who have relentlessly suppressed any opposition activities and muzzled independent media, failed to prevent the attack despite the U.S. warnings. The assault came two weeks after the U.S. Embassy in Moscow issued a notice urging Americans to avoid crowded places in view of “imminent” plans by extremists to target large Moscow gatherings, including concerts. Several other Western embassies repeated the warning. Earlier this week, Putin denounced the warning as an attempt to intimidate Russians. Investigators on Saturday combed through the charred wreckage of the hall for more victims. Hundreds of people stood in line in Moscow to donate blood and plasma, Russia’s health ministry said. Putin’s claim that the attackers tried to flee to Ukraine followed comments by Russian lawmakers who pointed the finger at Ukraine immediately after the attack. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy angrily rejected Moscow’s accusations as an attempt by Putin and his lieutenants to shift the blame to Ukraine while treating their own people as “expendables.” “They are burning our cities — and they are trying to blame Ukraine,” he said in a statement on his messaging app channel. “They torture and rape our people — and they blame them. They drove hundreds of thousands of their terrorists here to fight us on our Ukrainian soil, and they don’t care what happens inside their own country.” Images shared by Russian state media showed emergency vehicles still gathered outside the ruins of the concert hall, which could hold more than 6,000 people and hosted many big events, including the 2013 Miss Universe beauty pageant that featured Donald Trump. On Friday, crowds were at the venue for a concert by the Russian rock band Picnic. Videos posted online showed gunmen in the venue shooting civilians at point-blank range. Russian news reports cited authorities and witnesses as saying the attackers threw explosive devices that started the fire, which eventually consumed the building and caused its roof to collapse. Dave Primov, who survived the attack, told the AP that the gunmen were “shooting directly into the crowd” in the front rows. He described the chaos in the hall as concertgoers raced to escape: “People began to panic, started to run and collided with each other. Some fell down and others trampled on them.” After he and others crawled out of the hall into nearby utility rooms, he said he heard pops from small explosives and smelled burning as the attackers set the building ablaze. By the time they got out of the massive building 25 minutes later, it was engulfed in flames. “Had it been just a little longer, we could simply get stuck there in the fire,” Primov said. Messages of outrage, shock and support for the victims and their families streamed in from around the world. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement that the U.S. condemned the attack and noted that the Islamic State group is a “common terrorist enemy that must be defeated everywhere.” IS, which lost much of its ground after Russia’s military action in Syria, has long targeted Russia. In a statement posted by the group’s Aamaq news agency, IS’s Afghanistan affiliate said it had attacked a large gathering of “Christians” in Krasnogorsk. The group issued a new statement Saturday on Aamaq saying the attack was carried out by four men who used automatic rifles, a pistol, knives and firebombs. It said the assailants fired at the crowd and used knives to kill some concertgoers, casting the raid as part of IS’s ongoing war with countries that it says are fighting Islam. In October 2015, a bomb planted by IS downed a Russian passenger plane over Sinai, killing all 224 people on board, most of them Russian vacation-goers returning from Egypt. The group, which operates mainly in Syria and Iraq but also in Afghanistan and Africa, also has claimed several attacks in Russia’s volatile Caucasus and other regions in the past years. It recruited fighters from Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union. The group’s Afghanistan affiliate is known variously as ISIS-K or IS-K, taking its name from Khorasan Province, a region that covered much of Afghanistan, Iran and Central Asia in the Middle Ages. The affiliate has thousands of fighters who have repeatedly carried out attacks in Afghanistan since the country was seized in 2021 by the Taliban, a group with which they are at bitter odds. ISIS-K was behind the August 2021 suicide bombing at Kabul airport that left 13 American troops and about 170 Afghans dead during the chaotic U.S. withdrawal. They also claimed responsibility for a bomb attack in Kerman, Iran, in January that killed 95 people at a memorial procession. On March 7, just hours before the U.S. Embassy warned about imminent attacks, Russia’s top security agency said it had thwarted an attack on a synagogue in Moscow by an IS cell and killed several of its members in the Kaluga region near the Russian capital. A few days before that, Russian authorities said six alleged IS members were killed in a shootout in Ingushetia, in Russia’s Caucasus region. ___ Associated Press writers Michael Balsamo in Washington and Colleen Long in Wilmington, Delaware, contributed to this report.",CREDIBLE

How did Catherine the Great come into power? What was the Instruction of Catherine the Great? How did Catherine the Great die? Catherine the Great (born April 21 [May 2, New Style], 1729, Stettin, Prussia [now Szczecin, Poland]—died November 6 [November 17], 1796, Tsarskoye Selo [now Pushkin], near St. Petersburg, Russia) was a German-born empress of Russia (1762–96) who led her country into full participation in the political and cultural life of Europe, carrying on the work begun by Peter the Great. With her ministers she reorganized the administration and law of the Russian Empire and extended Russian territory, adding Crimea and much of Poland. Early life Sophie Friederike Auguste, Prinzessin (princess) von Anhalt-Zerbst, was the daughter of an obscure German prince, Christian August von Anhalt-Zerbst, but she was related through her mother to the dukes of Holstein. At age 14 she was chosen to be the wife of Karl Ulrich, duke of Holstein-Gottorp, grandson of Peter the Great and heir to the throne of Russia as the grand duke Peter. In 1744 Catherine arrived in Russia, assumed the title of Grand Duchess Catherine Alekseyevna, and married her young cousin the following year. The marriage was a complete failure; the following 18 years were filled with disappointment and humiliation for her. Russia at the time was ruled by Peter the Great’s daughter, the empress Elizabeth, whose 20-year reign greatly stabilized the monarchy. Devoted to much pleasure and luxury and greatly desirous of giving her court the brilliancy of a European court, Elizabeth prepared the way for Catherine. Catherine, however, would not have become empress if her husband had been at all normal. He was extremely neurotic, rebellious, obstinate, perhaps impotent, nearly alcoholic, and, most seriously, a fanatical worshipper of Frederick II of Prussia, the foe of the empress Elizabeth. Catherine, by contrast, was clearheaded and ambitious. Her intelligence, flexibility of character, and love of Russia gained her much support. She was humiliated, bored, and regarded with suspicion while at court, but she found comfort in reading extensively and in preparing herself for her future role as sovereign. Although a woman of little beauty, Catherine possessed considerable charm, a lively intelligence, and extraordinary energy. During her husband’s lifetime alone, she had at least three lovers; if her hints are to be believed, none of her three children, not even the heir apparent Paul, was fathered by her husband. Her true passion, however, was ambition; since Peter was incapable of ruling, she saw quite early the possibility of eliminating him and governing Russia herself. The empress Elizabeth died on December 25, 1761 (January 5, 1762, New Style), while Russia, allied with Austria and France, was engaged in the Seven Years’ War against Prussia. Shortly after Elizabeth’s death, Peter, now emperor, ended Russia’s participation in the war and concluded an alliance with Frederick II of Prussia. He made no attempt to hide his hatred of Russia and his love of his native Germany; discrediting himself endlessly by his foolish actions, he also prepared to rid himself of his wife. Catherine had only to strike: she had the support of the army, especially the regiments at St. Petersburg, where Grigory Orlov, her lover, was stationed; the court; and public opinion in both capitals (Moscow and St. Petersburg). She was also supported by the “enlightened” elements of aristocratic society, since she was known for her liberal opinions and admired as one of the most cultivated persons in Russia. On June 28 (July 9, New Style), 1762, she led the regiments that had rallied to her cause into St. Petersburg and had herself proclaimed empress and autocrat in the Kazan Cathedral. Peter III abdicated and was assassinated eight days later. Although Catherine probably did not order the murder of Peter, it was committed by her supporters, and public opinion held her responsible. In September 1762, she was crowned with great ceremony in Moscow, the ancient capital of the tsars, and began a reign that was to span 34 years as empress of Russia under the title of Catherine II. First years as empress Despite Catherine’s personal weaknesses, she was above all a ruler. Truly dedicated to her adopted country, she intended to make Russia a prosperous and powerful state. Since her early days in Russia she had dreamed of establishing a reign of order and justice, of spreading education, creating a court to rival Versailles, and developing a national culture that would be more than an imitation of French models. Her projects obviously were too numerous to carry out, even if she could have given her full attention to them. Her most pressing practical problem, however, was to replenish the state treasury, which was empty when Elizabeth died; this she did in 1762 by secularizing the property of the clergy, who owned one-third of the land and serfs in Russia. The Russian clergy was reduced to a group of state-paid functionaries, losing what little power had been left to it by the reforms of Peter the Great. Since her coup d’etat and Peter’s suspicious death demanded both discretion and stability in her dealings with other nations, she continued to preserve friendly relations with Prussia, Russia’s old enemy, as well as with the country’s traditional allies, France and Austria. In 1764 she resolved the problem of Poland, a kingdom lacking definite boundaries and coveted by three neighbouring powers, by installing one of her old lovers, Stanisław Poniatowski, a weak man entirely devoted to her, as king of Poland. Her attempts at reform, however, were less than satisfying. A disciple of the English and French liberal philosophers, she saw very quickly that the reforms advocated by Montesquieu or Jean-Jacques Rousseau, which were difficult enough to put into practice in Europe, did not at all correspond to the realities of an anarchic and backward Russia. In 1767 she convened a commission composed of delegates from all the provinces and from all social classes (except the serfs) for the purpose of ascertaining the true wishes of her people and framing a constitution. The debates went on for months and came to nothing. Catherine’s Instruction to the commission was a draft of a constitution and a code of laws. It was considered too liberal for publication in France and remained a dead letter in Russia. Frustrated in her attempts at reform, Catherine seized the pretext of war with Turkey in 1768 to change her policy; henceforth, emphasis would be placed above all on national grandeur. Since the reign of Peter the Great, the Ottoman Empire had been the traditional enemy of Russia; inevitably, the war fired the patriotism and zeal of Catherine’s subjects. Although the naval victory at Çeşme in 1770 brought military glory to the empress, Turkey had not yet been defeated and continued fighting. At that point, Russia encountered unforeseen difficulties. First, a terrible plague broke out in Moscow; along with the hardships imposed by the war, it created a climate of disaffection and popular agitation. In 1773 Yemelyan Pugachov, a former officer of the Don Cossacks, pretending to be the dead emperor Peter III, incited the greatest uprising of Russian history prior to the revolution of 1917. Starting in the Ural region, the movement spread rapidly through the vast southeastern provinces, and in June 1774 Pugachov’s Cossack troops prepared to march on Moscow. At this point, the war with Turkey ended in a Russian victory, and Catherine sent her crack troops to crush the rebellion. Defeated and captured, Pugachov was beheaded in 1775, but the terror and chaos he inspired were not soon forgotten. Catherine now realized that for her the people were more to be feared than pitied, and that, rather than freeing them, she must tighten their bonds. Before her accession to power, Catherine had planned to emancipate the serfs, on whom the economy of Russia, which was 95 percent agricultural, was based. The serf was the property of the master, and the fortune of a noble was evaluated not in lands but in the “souls” he owned. When confronted with the realities of power, however, Catherine saw very quickly that emancipation of the serfs would never be tolerated by the owners, whom she depended upon for support, and who would throw the country into disorder once they lost their own means of support. Reconciling herself to an unavoidable evil without much difficulty, Catherine turned her attention to organizing and strengthening a system that she herself had condemned as inhuman. She imposed serfdom on the Ukrainians who had until then been free. By distributing the so-called crown lands to her favourites and ministers, she worsened the lot of the peasants, who had enjoyed a certain autonomy. At the end of her reign, there was scarcely a free peasant left in Russia, and, because of more systematized control, the condition of the serf was worse than it had been before Catherine’s rule. Thus, 95 percent of the Russian people did not in any way benefit directly from the achievements of Catherine’s reign. Rather, their forced labour financed the immense expenditures required for her ever-growing economic, military, and cultural projects. In these undertakings, at least, she proved herself to be a good administrator and could claim that the blood and sweat of the people had not been wasted. Influence of Grigory Potemkin In 1774, the year of Russia’s defeat of Turkey, Grigory Potemkin, who had distinguished himself in the war, became Catherine’s lover, and a brilliant career began for this official of the minor nobility, whose intelligence and abilities were equalled only by his ambition. He was to be the only one of Catherine’s favourites to play an extensive political role. Ordinarily, the empress did not mix business and pleasure; her ministers were almost always selected for their abilities. In Potemkin she found an extraordinary man whom she could love and respect and with whom she could share her power. As minister he had unlimited powers, even after the end of their liaison, which lasted only two years. Potemkin must be given part of the credit for the somewhat extravagant splendour of Catherine’s reign. He had a conception of grandeur that escaped the rather pedestrian German princess, and he understood the effect it produced on the people. A great dreamer, he was avid for territories to conquer and provinces to populate; an experienced diplomat with a knowledge of Russia that Catherine had not yet acquired and as audacious as Catherine was methodical, Potemkin was treated as an equal by the empress up to the time of his death in 1791. They complemented and understood each other, and the ambitious minister expressed his respect for his sovereign through complete devotion to her interests. The annexation of Crimea from the Turks in 1783 was Potemkin’s work. Through that annexation and the acquisition of the territories of the Crimean khanate, which extended from the Caucasus Mountains to the Bug River in southwestern Russia, Russia held the north shore of the Black Sea and was in a position to threaten the existence of the Ottoman Empire and to establish a foothold in the Mediterranean. Catherine also sought to renew the alliance with Austria, Turkey’s neighbour and enemy, and renounced the alliance with Prussia and England, who were alarmed by Russian ambitions. Yet, during Catherine’s reign, the country did not become involved in a European war, because the empress scrupulously adhered to the territorial agreements she had concluded with several western European nations. Catherine’s glorification reached its climax in a voyage to Crimea arranged by Potemkin in 1787. In a festive Arabian Nights atmosphere, the empress crossed the country to take possession of her new provinces; the emperor of Austria, the king of Poland, and innumerable diplomats came to honour her and to enjoy the splendours of what became known as “Cleopatra’s fleet” because Catherine and her court traveled partly by water. She dedicated new towns bearing her name and announced that she ultimately intended to proceed to Constantinople. Effects of the French Revolution Catherine, like all the crowned heads of Europe, felt seriously threatened by the French Revolution. The divine right of royalty and the aristocracy was being questioned, and Catherine, although a “friend of the Enlightenment,” had no intention of relinquishing her own privileges: “I am an aristocrat, it is my profession.” In 1790 the writer A.N. Radishchev, who attempted to publish a work openly critical of the abuses of serfdom, was tried, condemned to death, then pardoned and exiled. Ironically, the sentiments Radishchev expressed were very similar to Catherine’s Instruction of 1767. Next, Poland, encouraged by the example of France, began agitating for a liberal constitution. In 1792, under the pretext of forestalling the threat of revolution, Catherine sent in troops and the next year annexed most of western Ukraine, while Prussia helped itself to large territories of western Poland. After the national uprising led by Tadeusz Kościuszko in 1794, Catherine wiped Poland off the map of Europe by dividing it between Russia, Prussia, and Austria in 1795. Catherine’s last years were darkened by the execution of Louis XVI, the advance of the revolutionary armies, and the spread of radical ideas. The empress realized, moreover, that she had no suitable successor. She considered her son Paul an incompetent and unbalanced man; her grandson Alexander was too young yet to rule.",CREDIBLE

In 1928, Stalin began to introduce agricultural collectivisation policies. Farmers were forced to give up their farms to create larger ones controlled by the state. Stalin thought that collectivisation would increase production but the opposite happened.2 The Soviet government also demanded that Ukraine should export a large amount of grain to feed other parts of the Soviet Union and to sell to other countries to gain foreign currency. In January 1932, almost a million tons of grain were collected across the Soviet Union of which 40% was provided by Ukraine.3 Decreased production and increased collections by government inevitably caused a shortfall for consumption in Ukraine. In February, Soviet leaders began to receive reports from the secret police and the Ukrainian government that food shortages were occurring. In June, two Communist leaders of Ukraine, Vlas Chubar4 and Grigory Petrovsky,5 both wrote to Stalin graphically telling him about widespread hunger. Petrovsky wrote that he had seen “a considerable part of the countryside engulfed in famine” and asked for “urgent food relief”.6 Stalin knew that the famine was taking place but refused to help and blamed others. In a letter to his colleague Lazar Kaganovich, Stalin said that he “did not like” the letters of Chubar and Petrovsky and that a reduction in grain procurement from Ukraine was not “acceptable”.7 The grain which the central government had targeted for collection could not be found. In the months of October and November 1932 combined, only 39.4% of the procurement target had been collected.8 Stalin sent Kaganovich and high-ranking members of the secret service to enforce collection. Despite the growing famine, they put pressure on the Ukrainian Communist Party to resolve that all collective farms which had not fulfilled their quota must ship within five days all their grain reserves including those kept by for future sowing.9 Armed groups demanded grain and other foodstuffs and searched for hiding places. Resistance was met by arrests and executions. The death rate from starvation was highest between February and July 1933. Many attempted to leave the country but Stalin implemented a directive preventing the sale of train tickets to peasants. There were reports of cannibalism. In the later stages of starvation, people became weak and listless. Bellies became inflated. Corpses were dropped into mass graves or just left on the street. Over 15 countries, including Australia and Canada, now recognise Holodomor as a genocide.

The bill is seen as a test of whether the nation, a former Soviet state, will forge closer ties with Europe and the United States, or remain within Russia’s orbit. Critics of the law say is it is a Kremlin-inspired effort to undermine democracy which will damage Georgia’s bid to join the European Union. Thousands of people demonstrated outside the country’s parliament in the capital Tbilisi on Wednesday after the government passed the draft bill on its first reading – the first of three hurdles it will have to clear before becoming law. The ruling Georgian Dream party first tried to pass the bill 13 months ago, but was forced into an embarrassing climbdown following a week of intense protests. But, after reintroducing the legislation earlier this month, many fear the government will this time be determined to see it through, despite a growing outcry. The law, called “On the Transparency of Foreign Influence,” has been likened by opponents to a measure introduced by President Vladimir Putin to stifle criticism in Russia. It would require organizations in the South Caucasus country receiving more than 20% of their funding from overseas to register as “foreign agents” or face large fines. “It is a Russian law. It is an exact duplicate of the Putin law that was adopted a few years ago and then complemented in order to crush civil society,” Salome Zourabichvili, Georgia’s president and a longstanding opponent of Georgian Dream, told CNN. Zourabichvili suggested that the law is intended to derail the country’s bid to join the European Union, after it was granted candidate status in December. “Russia now is starting its hybrid strategy, it’s reinvigorating it, and it’s trying to stop us on that road – helped, obviously, by the authorities today,” she said. Zourabichvili intends to veto the law, but conceded that her powers are mostly symbolic. Her veto could be overridden by the government’s parliamentary majority. The Kremlin has claimed that the law was being used to “provoke anti-Russian sentiments,” adding that protests against it were being stirred by “outside” influences. After the bill passed its first reading, the EU warned its “final adoption would negatively impact Georgia’s progress” on its path to membership. Nearly 80% of Georgians support European integration, according to a poll conducted in December by the National Democratic Institute. “I hope that we will show the power of free people, that we will not give up, and I hope that it will make them decide to take back this unacceptable legislation,” Giorgi Bekurashvili, a young demonstrator, told CNN Monday. Every night this week so far, thousands of Georgians have flooded the streets to oppose the bill, with many waving EU flags and chanting “Russian slaves” at their lawmakers. Video on social media from Tuesday night showed a brutal police response, as officers hunted down individual protesters, beating some and arresting others. Many Georgians retain a deep hostility towards Russia, which invaded Georgia in 2008 and today occupies about 20% of its internationally recognized territories – about the same proportion it occupies in Ukraine. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, thousands of Russians – especially men of service age – have fled to Georgia to avoid conscription.",CREDIBLE

The numbers indicate a stark increase in the use of illegal chemical agents, marking a sharp uptick from about 600 recorded uses as of January, Ukraine's military reported. According to statistic compiled by Ukraine, reported cases peaked in May 2024 with a record high of 715 cases reported, and has slowly declined into the summer months. No data was immediately available for the month of August. Ukrainian soldiers and officers interviewed by the Kyiv Independent acknowledged that the tactic is effective, allowing Moscow to capture positions occasionally without destroying them. Ukrainian soldiers reported suffering up to six gas attacks daily, usually two to three attacks within an hour. Earlier this year, the U.S. State Department confirmed Russian forces have used the chemical agent chloropicrin in Ukraine. The announcement was part of a larger statement about the introduction of new U.S. sanctions against more than 280 individuals and entities. ""The use of such chemicals is not an isolated incident, and is probably driven by Russian forces' desire to dislodge Ukrainian forces from fortified positions and achieve tactical gains on the battlefield,"" the U.S. State Department said at the time, asserting that Moscow has violated the Chemical Weapons Convention by deploying riot control agents as a method of warfare. Chloropicrin is often used as an herbicide. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), exposure to its vapors can cause severe irritation to the skin, eyes, and, if inhaled, internal organs. Russian naval infantry units have previously confirmed that they used illegal K-51 aerosol grenades, filled with the Riot Control Agent gas CS (2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile), a tear gas used for crowd control. Riot Control Agents are prohibited from being used in modern warfare under the Chemical Weapons Convention. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said on May 7 that accusations from both Ukraine and Russia that the other has used chemical weapons during the full-scale invasion remain ""insufficiently substantiated."" ""Both the Russian Federation and Ukraine have accused one another and reported allegations of use of chemical weapons to the Organization,"" the OPCW said in a statement. ""The information provided to the Organization so far by both sides, together with the information available to the Secretariat, is insufficiently substantiated.""

Inaugurated in 1958 as the Common Assembly, the European Parliament originally consisted of representatives selected by the national parliaments of EU member countries. Beginning in 1979, members of the European Parliament (MEPs) were elected by direct universal suffrage to terms of five years. There are more than 700 members. The number of members per country varies depending on population; for example, France, Germany, and Italy have more than 70 MEPs each, while Cyprus, Luxembourg, and Malta each have fewer than 7. The vast majority of MEPs sit in one of seven transnational political groups, rather than in national groups. A significant number of members, however, are not attached to any transnational group; they represent various political parties of their home countries. The largest transnational groups are the centre-right Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (largely comprising members of the Party of European Socialists). The Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (dominated by members of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party) occupies a significant number of seats as well. The European Parliament meets annually for about 12 one-week plenary sessions in Strasbourg, France. Most other work (e.g., committee meetings) takes place in Brussels. The Bureau, which is responsible for the Parliament’s budgetary, administrative, and organizational matters, is headed by a president and 14 vice presidents who are elected from among Parliament members to terms of 30 months. The Parliament is subdivided into specialized committees, including those on foreign affairs, budgets, agriculture, economic and monetary affairs, employment, women’s rights, citizens’ freedoms and rights, the environment, and regional affairs. Temporary committees also are established on occasion to address issues of particular concern. The Parliament is assisted in its work by a Secretariat, which spends much of its time translating and interpreting between the European Union’s 23 official languages. The powers of the European Parliament, which originally was only a consultative body, have increased in some areas as integration has proceeded. For example, the Parliament gained veto power in most areas relating to economic integration and budgetary policy. With the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty in 2009, the Parliament assumed further legislative powers. Notably, the codecision procedure, whereby the Parliament adopts legislation in concert with the Council of the European Union (the decision-making body comprising ministerial representatives from the member countries), was extended to many policy areas. The body also serves as a democratic check on other EU institutions. In particular, it must approve and is empowered to remove the president of the European Commission (the EU’s main executive body). The Parliament also has the power to censure the Commission with a two-thirds vote of its members, thereby forcing the Commission to resign. Although a censure has never been voted, the entire Commission resigned rather than face such a motion in 1999.",CREDIBLE

Zbigniew Brzezinski was the U.S. diplomat and political scientist of Polish decent who authored several books and advised American leaders for decades. Brzezinski died in May 2017 at the age of 89. While the Svobodnya Pressa report did not cite the source for the quote, multiple variations of the same quote have been circulating for years throughout the Russian media and repeated by the country’s top newsmakers, including State Duma deputy Natalia Narochinitskaya and Academy Award-winning movie director Nikita Mikhalkov. In its May 2017 obituary of Brzezinski, the Russian edition of Esquire magazine cited a slightly different version of the same quote, attributing it to Brzezinski’s 1997 book “The Grand Chessboard"": “Here is what he wrote in his famous book ‘The Great Chessboard"" (published in 1997): ‘The New World Order will be built against Russia, on the ruins of Russia and at the expense of Russia. We destroyed the Soviet Union, we will destroy Russia. You don't stand a chance’.” After examining Brzezinski’s published works, as well as interviews with people who were close to him, Polygraph.info concludes that the quote is fake. The quote that Esquire attributed to Brzezinski’s “The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives"" in fact, does not appear in the book. Other Russian media have reported that the quote came from a speech Brzezinski gave in Lviv, Ukraine on September 24, 1998, as he was accepting honorary citizenship from the city council. That is also false: nothing resembling the quote is in the transcript of the speech. “Very doubtful he said anything like that. Not his style or lingo,” Ian Brzezinski told Polygraph.info regarding the attribution of the quote to his father. Janusz Bugajski, Senior Fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, a Washington, DC think tank, who was Brzezinski’s friend and colleague for over 30 years, told Polygraph.info: “This is manufactured propaganda. And it is not so much about Zbig, it’s about the fears within Moscow that this empire that they are still maintaining is threatened with collapse, so they are looking now for scapegoats, even the scapegoats that are unfortunately no longer with us, to justify their campaign against the West.” Former U.S. State Department foreign policy adviser Paul Goble suggested that the quote was fabricated intentionally. “I think the Russians extrapolated from what ZB actually said in order to make their point more dramatic,” Goble told Polygraph.info, adding that such manipulation “also serves their purposes by blaming someone who is no longer with us, was associated with the Democrats, and is a convenient punching bag.” Glen Howard, president of the Jamestown Foundation, a Washington, DC think-tank, told Polygraph.info: “This seems like sort of a vast distortion. Brzezinski never went around talking about the ‘ruins of Russia;’ that is way below his style of speaking, which was always eloquent and nuanced and always in the style of a gentleman. This to me seems like some sort of fabricated phrase that the Russians would make up and use and spread to falsify what he actually said.” “The Russian governments since the communist time have accused Zbig of wanting to destroy the Soviet Union and destroy Russia, but nowhere in his texts, nowhere in his speeches is there any evidence that he had advocated this,” Bugajski added. “What he was saying was quite the opposite -- that there is hope for Russia as its younger generation, which has not experienced communism, hopefully will turn away from this national-imperialist project and turn towards democracy and international cooperation. What he has said, which is much more important, is that for Russia to become a country with which the U.S. can cooperate, it needs to revoke any imperial pretensions, what he called ‘imperial nostalgia,’ to create good relations with countries such as Ukraine and Georgia and others, and to democratize internally.”",CREDIBLE

Blackmail involves threats to inflict embarrassment or financial loss unless certain demands are met. Put simply, it is the act of extracting money through extortion, employing techniques such as threats, violence or abuse of authority. Energy blackmail follows a similar rationale. Although it lacks an established definition, energy blackmail (or energy weaponisation) can be understood as a strategic manipulation of energy resources, primarily oil and natural gas, but potentially also other fuels (e.g., nuclear fuel) for political and/or economic gain. Energy blackmail can assume different forms encompassing complete or partial disruptions in supply, both implicit and explicit threats (related to supply interruptions or other issues), coercive pricing strategies (employing prices as incentives or deterrents) or leveraging existing energy debts, and asset control (e.g., influencing decision-making through ownership of critical supply pipelines). Generally speaking, energy blackmail frequently falls into two categories: coercion and market manipulation. Coercion relates to the practice of forceful persuasion, as when the supply of strategic energy resources is made conditional upon the fulfilment of some political or economic ultimatum. Market manipulation involves the deliberate interference with the free and fair operation of the market, creating artificial appearances or misleading impressions regarding the price and market conditions for various products, securities, commodities or currencies. In the energy sector, this often pertains to the strategic manipulation of prices for specific - often political - gains. The success and impact of energy blackmail depend heavily on its context. Russia’s strategic weaponisation of energy in Europe - evident since the early 1990s - was made possible by a range of factors. These included Moscow’s geopolitical considerations rooted in the Cold War rationale, the concentration of strategic energy resources in Russia, a complex network of dependencies created by the pipelines connecting former Soviet/satellite states with Russia as well as with each other, and the limited institutional and economic capacities of the newly independent states. The period following the collapse of the Soviet Union marked a significant political transition in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) as countries aimed to establish market economies despite their institutional weaknesses. This left them particularly vulnerable to Moscow’s use of energy exports as a foreign policy tool, as the Kremlin’s direct political and military control of their ‘near abroad’ was masterfully being replaced with non-military means. In the early 1990s, however, Russia frequently resorted to coercion. For instance, shortly after Lithuanian independence was restored on 11 March 1990, President Mikhail Gorbachev issued an ultimatum, demanding its annulment. The lack of Lithuanian compliance resulted in a 78 day economic blockade, which completely halted oil deliveries to Lithuania and led to an 84% decrease in gas supplies, together with the disrupted delivery of around 50 other products and materials. Moreover, Gorbachev threatened retributive actions towards the fellow Baltic States, warning of severe consequences should they choose to provideassistance to Lithuania. Thus, in the pivotal narrative of political independence, energy blackmail stood out as a critical element, significantly influencing the dynamics of this struggle. Over the years, the Russian approach to market manipulation became increasingly subtle and often challenging to identify. Many of its instances were easily misconstrued as routine market fluctuations, inflation or other common economic phenomena. Nevertheless, in 2018, in response to the antitrust investigation, the European Commission imposed binding obligations on Gazprom to enable the free flow of gas at competitive prices in CEE. Its conclusions noted that unfair prices might have been imposed on Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Indeed, the conclusions only reaffirmed the issues that Lithuania addressed to the EC Competition Directorate back in the spring of 2011. In 2019, Bulgaria resumed antitrust proceedings against Gazprom, as the country became subjected to the highest gas prices in Europe. Multiple CEE states claimed the ‘highest paying country’ title over the years. Seeking to fortify its economic resilience, the EU introduced a new legal tool in October 2023 against ‘Economic coercion by third countries’. It is critical to recognise that the Russian capacity to manipulate gas prices has been significantly aided by its strategic implementation of a discount policy. For instance, after paying below-market prices for Russian gas imports for many years, Ukraine found itself in a dispute with Gazprom over price increases on a number of occasions. Although raising gas prices to market levels is not in itself controversial, such disputes would typically coincide with political developments in Ukraine that contradicted Moscow’s interests. Multiple similar incidents have been recorded across the post-Soviet space, including Belarus, Moldova and others. Countering energy blackmail Energy blackmail ceases to be effective once states start to anticipate and counter potential coercion proactively. As such, multiple energy projects have been recently developed, especially in the CEE region, where post-Soviet infrastructural lock-ins were most prominent, making supply routes hard to diversify. LNG terminals in Lithuania (2014) and Poland (2016) and new energy corridors, as between Estonia-Finland (2019) and Lithuania-Poland (2022) along with earlier and upcoming gas connections, showcase a unified and strategic shift towards European energy independence. The weaponisation of energy supplies by Moscow against many Member States following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 prompted the EU to further increase the resilience of its energy system by greater diversification, tackling of bottlenecks, phasing out Russian fossil fuels, accelerating the green transition and increasing energy-saving measures across the EU. Together, these measures have reduced the Russian capacity to wield energy as a strategic weapon. However, the growing digital interconnectedness of the European energy infrastructure introduces new vulnerabilities, highlighting the complexity of modern energy security challenges. Whereas gas and oil markets are typically dominated by a few powerful players and driven by state interests, threats emerge in the cyber domain from a varied mix of actors - from individuals and groups to states and state-sponsored entities. Digital dilemmas and energy security The increased interconnectedness of energy systems is meant to improve the integration and optimisation of energy resources. Smart grids and Internet of Things (IoT) devices leverage high interconnectivity to adapt to energy demands with unprecedented efficiency, propelling us towards a renewable energy future. However, digital integration also expands the potential attack surface for cybercrimes and complicates the security efforts to protect them. With each additional device or communication system incorporated into the power network, the potential for unauthorised access grows, as each device can serve as a gateway for cyberattacks. Such vulnerabilities pose significant risks, as a single cybersecurity breach could trigger widespread grid failures or compromise sensitive data. The public does not fully grasp the extent of cybersecurity threats, as major breaches frequently go unreported or undetected. However, evidence suggests a worrisome trend: Cyberattacks on utility services have increased since 2018, with a significant uptick in 2022 following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Moreover, according to the recent assessment by the Danish EnergiCERT, up to 65% of the cyberattacks against the European energy sector since 2015 were ransomware attacks. Ransomware - a type of cryptovirological malware - operates by encrypting files on the victim’s system, rendering them inaccessible. These files are ‘held hostage’ while the perpetrators demand a ransom in exchange for the decryption key, which can restore access to the blocked personal data. Ransomware attacks across the European energy sector have impacted supply companies, gas distributors, refineries, wind turbine producers, wind-farm operators and prepaid electricity services. These cyberattacks have disabled wind-farm controls, disrupted prepaid meters and caused data breaches. Like other European countries, Denmark experienced significant attacks, as when the control systems of 22 energy companies were compromised in May 2023, forcing many into ‘island mode’ operation. Amidst rising attacks, the financial toll of a single data breach in the energy sector hit an unprecedented EUR 4.33 million in 2022. This stark reality highlights the urgency to strengthen cybersecurity defences. While the EU adoption of the Cyber Solidarity Act in April 2023 marks a significant advance in its cybersecurity efforts, recent events underscore the continuous necessity for robust and evolving cybersecurity measures. Beyond blackmail: Securing European energy landscape The weaponisation of energy in Europe illustrates how strategic resources can be utilised in political power games. Potential blackmail is by no means confined to the energy sector and has also been employed in other sectors. In the energy sector, the relative success of the EU in reducing its dependence on Russia since February 2022 has deprived the latter of much of its leverage. However, increasing the resilience of the European energy system necessitates both heightened security measures and learning from past lessons about the pitfalls of overdependency. Hence, several steps can be undertaken to further counter energy blackmail in the future: Diversification: Diversify current supply routes and avoid overdependencies on singular energy resources and technology suppliers (e.g., renewable energy technology from China). Self-sufficiency: Accelerate the deployment of low-carbon energy, cut energy demand and improve energy efficiency measures. Innovation: Increase funding for the large-scale development of new energy technologies (e.g., green hydrogen, carbon capture and storage). Contingency planning: Develop robust contingency plans for efficient responses to energy supply and infrastructure disruptions. Cyber resilience & network management: Embrace the EU Cyber Solidarity Act, integrating the Cybersecurity Shield and Emergency Mechanism, along with thorough log collection, network segmentation and consistent vulnerability scans for enhanced cybersecurity and swift EU response.",CREDIBLE

But opponents as well as a regional and global leaders expressed doubts over the validity of the vote count, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying Washington has ""serious concerns that the result announced does not reflect the will or the votes of the Venezuelan people."" Maduro's main rival, Maria Corina Machado, had been barred from running but claimed that her surrogate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, had won 70% of the vote. The CNE, which is loyal to the government, said that he had garnered only 44%. ""We want to say to all of Venezuela and the world that Venezuela has a new president-elect and it is Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia,"" Machado told journalists, adding: ""We won.""

Meanwhile, Venezuela's attorney general accused Machado of being involved in an attempted hack of the country's elections system, after she disputed the election result. Latin American countries demand review In response to the result, the Organization of American States (OAS) called for an urgent meeting to table a resolution ""to protect the will of the people in our region in accordance with the democratic charter and the foundational principles of democracy."" In the OAS statement, the governments of Argentina, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, the Dominican Republic and Uruguay expressed their concern over the conduct of the election and demanded ""a comprehensive review of the results in the presence of independent electoral observers in order to guarantee respect for the will of the Venezuelan people who took part in the election peacefully and in large numbers."" On Monday, Panama officially withdrew its diplomats from Venezuela and suspended diplomatic ties with Caracas pending a complete review. ""Out of respect for the history of Panama, the thousands of Venezuelans who chose to live in our homeland, and my democratic convictions, I cannot allow my silence to become complicity,"" said right-wing President Jose Raul Mulino. ""Regimes that do not respect human rights and violate freedoms do not deserve diplomatic recognition,"" he added.

""We call for the publication of detailed results for all polling stations and access to all voting and election documents for opposition and observers,"" the German Foreign Ministry said on X, formerly Twitter. The UK said it was ""concerned"" by allegations of vote ""irregularities."" ""We call for the swift and transparent publication of full, detailed results to ensure that the outcome reflects the votes of the Venezuelan people"", the foreign office said in a statement. The government of Spain urged ""total transparency"" about how the vote was conducted, with top diplomat Jose Manuel Albares asking Maduro to release verifiable and detailed data. Albares' Italian counterpart Antonio Tajani said his government was ""perplexed"" and did not think Maduro claiming victory mirrored ""the will of the people."" European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said that ""ensuring full transparency in the electoral process, including detailed counting of votes and access to voting records at polling stations, is vital,"" and otherwise the will of the Venezuelan people is not being respected.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the negotiators had made ""good progress"" on Thursday on a potential deal. Brett McGurk, President Biden’s Middle East co-ordinator, and Amos Hochstein, who has led negotiations in the conflict with Hezbollah, are in Israel for talks with the country’s authorities, although it was not clear whether any progress could be made ahead of the US presidential election, next week. Since the conflict escalated five weeks ago, Israel has launched widespread air strikes across Lebanon and a ground invasion of areas near the border. At least 2,200 people have been killed in the country, according to the Lebanese health ministry, and 1.2 million displaced, mostly Shia Muslims, heightening sectarian tensions and adding pressure on public services that were already struggling after years of a severe economic crisis. The Israeli government says its goal is to change the security situation along the border and guarantee the return of around 60,000 residents who have been displaced because of Hezbollah’s rocket, missile and drone attacks. On Wednesday, Israeli public broadcaster Kan published what it said was a draft agreement, written by Washington and dated Saturday, for an initial 60-day ceasefire. Israel would withdraw its forces from Lebanon within the first week of the deal, and the Lebanese army would be deployed along the border. During the pause, Hezbollah would end its armed presence in the area. The objective is to pave the way for the full implementation of United Nations Resolution 1701, which ended the 34-day war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. The text, among other things, called for the removal of all armed groups, including Hezbollah, from the area south of the Litani River, 30km (20 miles) north of the border. Only the UN peacekeeping force known as Unifil and the Lebanese army would be allowed there. Israel, however, distrustful that the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers will be able to keep Hezbollah away from the border, reportedly wants to be given the right to strike the group if needed after the end of the war. This demand is likely to be rejected by the Lebanese authorities, who say there should be no changes to Resolution 1701. When asked about the document reported by Kan, White House national security spokesperson Sean Savett said there were “many reports and drafts circulating” that “do not reflect the current state of negotiations”. He did not, however, respond to a question about whether that text was the basis for further talks. On Thursday, commenting on the negotiations, Secretary Blinken said there had been progress made on mutual understanding of the requirements of the resolution. ""It's important to make sure we have clarity, both from Lebanon and from Israel, about what would be required under 1701 to get its effective implementation,"" he said during a press conference. Hezbollah, a powerful militia and political party which is armed and financially supported by Iran, faces domestic pressure for a deal, particularly from critics who say the group dragged Lebanon into a conflict which was not in the country’s interests. Israel’s bombardments have killed most of the Hezbollah leadership, including long-time chief Hassan Nasrallah, and brought extensive destruction to areas of southern Lebanon, the eastern Bekaa Valley and Beirut’s southern suburbs, where the group holds sway. The group started its campaign the day after the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October last year, and has long said its attacks will continue unless there is a ceasefire in Gaza. It is not clear whether it would be willing to change its position. On Wednesday, Naim Qassem gave his first speech as Hezbollah’s new secretary general, in which he said the group would continue with its war plan under his leadership, but that it could agree to a deal within certain terms. So far, he said, Israel had not presented any proposal that could be discussed. As he spoke, Israel launched heavy air strikes on the historic city of Baalbek, in the Bekaa Valley, in what could indicate an expansion of its military campaign against the group in a strategically important area near the border with Syria. Hours later, in an interview to Lebanon’s Al Jazeed television, Mr Mikati said he became “cautiously optimistic” after a phone call with Mr Hochstein, who had visited Lebanon last week, saying a ceasefire could be possible in the “coming hours or days”. It remained unclear, however, if any agreement could be reached before the US presidential election on Tuesday, with reports suggesting the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was waiting the outcome of the vote before deciding. Violence continued on Thursday, with rocket attacks by Hezbollah killing seven in Israel - the deadliest day in the country since the escalation in the conflict - while Israeli attacks killed six health workers in southern Lebanon. US officials are also trying to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

It’s now more than a month since the last case of Ebola in DRC. If it stays that way, the outbreak will be declared over in less than a month’s time. We’d like to thank all our partners for their solidarity in staying the course in the service of the people of DRC – and my special appreciation to the government and people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That same spirit of solidarity must be at the centre of our efforts to defeat COVID-19. More than 200,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported to WHO, and more than 8000 people have lost their lives. More than 80% of all cases are from two regions – the Western Pacific and Europe. We know that many countries now face escalating epidemics and are feeling overwhelmed. We hear you. We know the tremendous difficulties you face and the enormous burden you’re under. We understand the heart-wrenching choices you are having to make. We understand that different countries and communities are in different situations, with different levels of transmission. Every day, WHO is talking to ministers of health, heads of state, health workers, hospital managers, industry leaders, CEOs and more – to help them prepare and prioritize, according to their specific situation. Don’t assume your community won’t be affected. Prepare as if it will be. Don’t assume you won’t be infected. Prepare as if you will be. But there is hope. There are many things all countries can do. Physical distancing measures – like cancelling sporting events, concerts and other large gatherings – can help to slow transmission of the virus. They can reduce the burden on the health system. And they can help to make epidemics manageable, allowing targeted and focused measures. But to suppress and control epidemics, countries must isolate, test, treat and trace. If they don’t, transmission chains can continue at a low level, then resurge once physical distancing measures are lifted. WHO continues to recommend that isolating, testing and treating every suspected case, and tracing every contact, must be the backbone of the response in every country. This is the best hope of preventing widespread community transmission. Most countries with sporadic cases or clusters of cases are still in the position to do this. Many countries are listening to our call and finding solutions to increase their ability to implement the full package of measures that have turned the tide in several countries. But we know that some countries are experiencing intense epidemics with extensive community transmission. We understand the effort required to suppress transmission in these situations. But it can be done. A month ago, the Republic of Korea was faced with accelerating community transmission. But it didn’t surrender. It educated, empowered and engaged communities; It developed an innovative testing strategy and expanded lab capacity; It rationed the use of masks; It did exhaustive contact tracing and testing in selected areas; And it isolated suspected cases in designated facilities rather than hospitals or at home. As a result, cases have been declining for weeks. At the peak there were more than 800 cases, and today the report was only 90 cases. WHO is working in solidarity with other countries with community transmission to apply the lessons learned in Korea and elsewhere, and adapt them to the local context. Likewise, WHO continues to recommend that, wherever possible, confirmed mild cases should be isolated in health facilities, where trained professionals can provide good medical care, and prevent clinical progression and onward transmission. If that’s not possible, countries can use community facilities to isolate and care for mild cases and refer them for specialized care quickly if needed. If health facilities are at risk of being overwhelmed, people with mild disease can be cared for at home. Although this is not the ideal situation, WHO has advice on our website for how home-care can be provided as safely as possible. WHO continues to call on all countries to implement a comprehensive approach, with the aim of slowing down transmission and flattening the curve. This approach is saving lives and buying time for the development of vaccines and treatments. As you know, the first vaccine trial has begun, just 60 days after the genetic sequence of the virus was shared by China. This is an incredible achievement. We commend the researchers around the world who have come together to systemically evaluate experimental therapeutics. Multiple small trials with different methodologies may not give us the clear, strong evidence we need about which treatments help to save lives. WHO and its partners are therefore organizing a study in many countries in which some of these untested treatments are compared with each other. This large, international study is designed to generate the robust data we need, to show which treatments are the most effective. We have called this study the SOLIDARITY trial. The SOLIDARITY trial provides simplified procedures to enable even hospitals that have been overloaded to participate. Many countries have already confirmed that they will join the SOLIDARITY trial - Argentina, Bahrain, Canada, France, Iran, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland and Thailand - and I trust many more will join. I continue to be inspired by the many demonstrations of solidarity from all over the world. The COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund has now raised more than US$43 million from more than 173,000 individuals and organizations, a few days since we launched it. I’d especially like to thank FIFA for its contribution of US$10 million. These and other efforts give me hope that together, we can and will prevail. This virus is presenting us with an unprecedented threat. But it’s also an unprecedented opportunity to come together as one against a common enemy – an enemy against humanity. I thank you.",CREDIBLE

A claim emerged in Chinese and Russian media reports that the U.S. asset manager BlackRock requested the Ukrainian government to refrain from burying dead Ukrainian soldiers on farm land it owns in the country. But the claim is false. Under Ukrainian law, foreign companies and individuals are prohibited from purchasing arable land. The claim was shared in an editorial published by a military columnist Zhao Yongling on the website of Phoenix TV on Aug. 6, 2024. “BlackRock purchased 47% of Ukraine’s arable lands … BlackRock has asked the Ukrainian government to stop burying deceased Ukrainian soldiers and look for other ways to take care of them because it wants to use the lands in a different way,” reads the claim in part. Zhao cited a Bulgarian politician named Plamen Paskov whose claim about BlackRock's land ownership in Ukraine was previously shared by Russia's state-run Sputnik news agency. The same claim was shared on other Chinese websites as seen here, here and here. BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world with more than US$10 trillion in assets under management. The New York-based multinational asset manager has a big enough stake in many influential companies worldwide to push them to change decisions and priorities. According to a Ukrainian government press release, President Volodymyr Zelensky met BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to discuss how Ukraine could raise national reconstruction funds at the end of 2022. In May 2023, the Ukrainian government signed an agreement with BlackRock to provide support services to the Ukraine Development Fund in order to attract funds to rebuild the economy after the war ends. But the claim about BlackRock’s land ownership in Ukraine and its request to the government regarding deceased soldiers is false. Under Ukrainian law, foreign companies and individuals are prohibited from purchasing arable land. “Agricultural land cannot be transferred (allotted) to foreigners, stateless persons, foreign legal entities and foreign states,” reads the Article 22 of Ukraine’s Land Code (No. 2768-III of 2001). Keyword searches found a similar claim has circulated since 2023, which has been debunked by other fact-checking organizations, including Myth Detector based in Georgia. Dafina Kandova, a journalist with the Bulgarian checking organization factcheck.bg, told AFCL that her organization had checked several similar rumors circulating in Bulgaria at the end of 2023. Dafina added that while Plamen Paskov often appears as a commentator for the Bulgarian nationalist Ataka party, he is not actually an official member of the party and has not been elected to public office. Paskov’s popularity is largely built on social media, gaining followers by spreading conspiracy theories related to hot topics such as COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine, she added. He is also well-known for openly sympathizing with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s policies. A BlackRock spokesperson told AFCL: “This is completely false. BlackRock does not own any land in Ukraine.” Translated by Shen Ke. Edited by Shen Ke and Taejun Kang. Updated to include a comment from a BlackRock spokesperson.

https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/coronavirus-a-north-american-epidemic/,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html,2024-12-05,"Key points - MERS is a viral respiratory illness. - Most MERS cases have been detected in countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula. - MERS represents a very low risk to the general public in the United States. What it is Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus called Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The virus can spread from camels to people through direct physical contact. Limited human-to-human transmission is possible. MERS has caused severe respiratory disease in most diagnosed cases, and many of those patients died. Typical symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Most MERS cases have been detected in countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula. However, a number of cases linked to travel have been detected in countries outside this region. Did you know? Signs and symptoms Most people with confirmed MERS-CoV infection have had severe respiratory illness. MERS symptoms usually appear 5 or 6 days after a person is exposed. However, symptoms can appear as early as 2 days and up to 14 days after exposure. Common symptoms of MERS include: - Fever - Cough - Shortness of breath Some people may also have diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. It is also possible that someone with MERS may have only mild symptoms or no symptoms. In most known MERS cases, the infected person developed pneumonia. Additional complications such as kidney failure have also occurred. About 3 or 4 out of every 10 people reported with a MERS infection died. Most of the people who die from MERS had at least one preexisting medical condition. Certain conditions may increase the risk of getting severe complications from MERS. These include: - Diabetes - Cardiovascular disease, including high blood pressure - Chronic lung disease - Chronic heart disease - Chronic kidney disease - Cancer Contact the CDC Emergency Operations Center Who is at risk MERS-CoV Positivity in the US You may be at increased risk of getting MERS if you: - Recently (in the past 14 days) returned from travel in or near the Arabian Peninsula, and especially if you also: - Worked in or visited a healthcare setting - Had direct physical contact with camels (including touching or grooming) - Had close contact with a person who was sick with fever or respiratory symptoms - Worked in or visited a healthcare setting - Had close contact in the past 14 days with someone who was sick with fever or respiratory symptoms of unknown cause after they had traveled in or near the Arabian Peninsula - Had close contact in the past 14 days with someone who has tested positive for MERS When to call your healthcare provider How it spreads The virus that causes MERS can spread through respiratory secretions, such as saliva or mucous, of infected animals or people. The MERS-CoV virus is mostly found in camels (dromedaries), and direct physical contact with camels can lead to transmission to humans. People infected through contact with camels can then spread the virus to other people. Large MERS outbreaks from person-to-person spread have occurred in healthcare facilities treating patients with MERS. Some spread can occur in households through close contact (like sharing a bed or caring for someone who is sick). The largest known outbreak of MERS outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in the Republic of Korea in 2015. Multiple healthcare facilities were affected by the outbreak, which was associated with a traveler returning from the Arabian Peninsula. All reported person-to-person transmissions of MERS have been linked to a person who had been in or near the Arabian Peninsula. Researchers continue to investigate clusters of MERS cases to better understand how the virus spreads. Prevention No vaccine exists to protect people against MERS. For travelers, the World Health Organization recommends: - Washing your hands before and after touching camels. - Avoiding drinking raw camel milk or camel urine or eating meat (including camel meat) that has not been properly cooked. - Avoiding close contact with camels, if you are at higher risk for severe MERS illness.",CREDIBLE

Since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion, Poland has provided our country with a total of 44 military packages of various types of weapons and ammunition worth more than EUR 4 billion. This year, Poland will provide several more military assistance packages, and according to the agreement, it is committed to continue supporting Ukraine for ten years of the document's validity. Poland will consider providing Ukraine with at least one additional MiG-29 squadron (minimum 14 fighter jets). For the first time among the bilateral security agreements already signed, the document enables the interception of missiles and drones in our country's airspace fired in the direction of Poland. Also for the first time, the security agreement provides for the creation of the Ukrainian Legion – personnel of the Security and Defense Forces of Ukraine to be trained in Poland, which will be open to Ukrainian citizens temporarily residing in Poland and other countries. The agreement includes a powerful block on cooperation in the defense industry, including the location of Polish defense companies' production facilities in Ukraine and the exploration of additional opportunities for joint defense production. Poland will also continue to operate the POLLOGHUB logistics hub and use the potential of the LITPOLUKRBRIG to strengthen the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The document aims to strengthen cooperation in the non-military sphere, in particular in intelligence, cybersecurity, maritime and information security, and defense of critical infrastructure. Separate blocks of the agreement relate to economic recovery and reconstruction, border infrastructure, and the development of transit potential. Political cooperation includes issues of European integration, implementation of Ukraine's Peace Formula, sanctions, compensation for Ukraine's losses, and bringing the aggressor to justice. Poland clearly reaffirms its support for Ukraine's EU and NATO membership. The document was signed in furtherance of the G7 Joint Declaration of Support for Ukraine, adopted in Vilnius on July 12, 2023.

The first successful use of the new weapon was confirmed by President Volodymyr Zelensky during his Independence Day speech on Aug. 24, and a new video posted on his social media on Aug. 25 has provided further details of the project. The video begins by highlighting that Russia has launched ""43,000 types of various missiles and glide bombs at Ukraine"" during the full-scale war, from airfields located deep within Russian territory. ""One of the most effective ways to counter this is to strike at the carriers of these weapons – Russian aircraft at military airfields,"" it adds. Ukraine has been prohibited from using Western-supplied weapons to attack targets this far inside Russia, forcing Ukraine to produce its own versions. ""And here are the first results – introducing Palianytsia, a Ukrainian long-range rocket drone,"" the video says. The name of the new weapon is hugely symbolic – as well as referring to a type of traditional Ukrainian bread, the word ""palianytsia"" is famoulsy difficult for Russians to pronounce correctly. There's been at least one report of it being used by Ukrainians to identify a Russian agent. The video says that ""almost everything about (the Palianytsia) is classified,"" but does reveal some new information. ""Two dozen Russian military airfields are within its strike range,"" it says, adding: ""The entire development was completed in an incredibly short period – in just a year-and-a-half."" It also reveals the weapon is powered by a turbojet engine and is launched from a ground platform, rather than fighter jets. It also claims the cost of the weapon is significantly less than its counterparts.

The first video was shared on Russian-language Facebook accounts (1, 2), e-news.su, and a Telegram channel. The footage shows a crowd in the streets, holding lit candles and singing “Ave Maria.” The post authors claim this took place in Paris, where people decided to “cleanse” the country in response to the Olympic Games’ alleged mockery of Christianity. The video was also published by the Kremlin propagandist Vladimir Solovyov. The second video, with similar descriptions, shows a crowd gathered around the Eiffel Tower. The video also features a banner with the French inscription: “Jesus, I love you.” The mentioned video was also published by “Media Holding Kvira.” Both videos are old and were filmed before the opening of the Paris Olympics. The first video has been circulating online since 2022 and depicts the celebration of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary in Lourdes, France. The second video was published on May 25, 2024, and shows the March for worshipping Jesus. - First Video – The Crowd Celebrates the Assumption of the Virgin Mary The Paris Olympics opened on July 26. This video, however, has been online since 2022 and was filmed in Lourdes, France. The oldest version was uploaded on August 15. According to the description, the crowd is celebrating the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. “Happy Feast of the Assumption everyone from Lourdes with crowd beautifully chanting ‘Ave Maria.’” – reads the description. August 15 is a Catholic holiday. The Feast of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, in Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and some Anglican Christian traditions, commemorates the Virgin Mary’s bodily assumption into Heaven at the end of her earthly life. The mentioned video was also published on August 15, 2022, by the official X page of the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes. - Second Video – The Crowd Gathered Around the Eiffel Tower Was Filmed on May 25 In the second video, we can observe the name of the account – jeanluctrachsel.ministries. On the Instagram account, the video was published on May 25, thus it cannot be related to the opening of the Paris Olympics. The following description accompanies the video: “Right now in Paris..at the Eiffel Tower bringing Jesus to this city. Worshipping Him and preaching Jesus to the crowd.” Notably, on July 30, the same Facebook account, Jean-Luc Trachsel Ministries, published the same video on Facebook with a clarification that the footage was taken on May 25 and is not related to the Paris Olympics. “It was an historic event where, 25,000+ people according to the local police, came to worship Jesus and where the Gospel was preached at Trocadéro/Eiffel Tower and then the streets of Paris being part of this global revival that has started in so many places” – reads the video description.

Roosevelt - Joseph Stalin - On the Web: - Air and Spaces Magazine - The Muddled Legend of Yalta (PDF) (Dec. 20, 2024) Yalta Conference, (February 4–11, 1945), major World War II conference of the three chief Allied leaders—Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt of the United States, Prime Minister Winston Churchill of the United Kingdom, and Premier Joseph Stalin of the Soviet Union—which met at Yalta in Crimea to plan the final defeat and occupation of Nazi Germany. It had already been decided that Germany would be divided into occupied zones administered by U.S., British, French, and Soviet forces. The conferees accepted the principle that the Allies had no duty toward the Germans except to provide minimum subsistence, declared that the German military industry would be abolished or confiscated, and agreed that major war criminals would be tried before an international court, which subsequently presided at Nürnberg. The determination of reparations was assigned to a commission. How to deal with the defeated or liberated countries of eastern Europe was the main problem discussed at the conference. The agreements reached, which were accepted by Stalin, called for “interim governmental authorities broadly representative of all democratic elements in the population…and the earliest possible establishment through free elections of governments responsive to the will of the people.” Britain and the United States supported a Polish government-in-exile in London, while the Soviets supported a communist-dominated Polish committee of national liberation in Lublin. Neither the Western Allies nor the Soviet Union would change its allegiance, so they could only agree that the Lublin committee would be broadened to include representatives of other Polish political groups, upon which the Allies would recognize it as a provisional government of national unity that would hold free elections to choose a successor government. Poland’s future frontiers were also discussed but not decided. Regarding the Pacific Theatre, a secret protocol stipulated that, in return for the Soviet Union’s entering the war against Japan within “two or three months” after Germany’s surrender, the U.S.S.R. would obtain from Japan the Kuril Islands and regain the territory lost in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 (including the southern part of Sakhalin Island), and the status quo in pro-Soviet Outer Mongolia would be maintained. Stalin agreed to sign a pact of alliance and friendship with China. The United Nations organization charter had already been drafted, and the conferees worked out a compromise formula for voting in the Security Council. The Soviets withdrew their claim that all 16 Soviet republics should have membership in the General Assembly. After the agreements reached at Yalta were made public in 1946, they were harshly criticized in the United States. This was because, as events turned out, Stalin failed to keep his promise that free elections would be held in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. Instead, communist governments were established in all those countries, noncommunist political parties were suppressed, and genuinely democratic elections were never held. At the time of the Yalta Conference, both Roosevelt and Churchill had trusted Stalin and believed that he would keep his word. Neither leader had suspected that Stalin intended that all the popular front governments in Europe would be taken over by communists. Roosevelt and Churchill were further inclined to assent to the Yalta agreements because they assumed, mistakenly as it turned out, that Soviet assistance would be sorely needed to defeat the Japanese in the Pacific and Manchuria. In any case, the Soviet Union was the military occupier of eastern Europe at the war’s end, and so there was little the Western democracies could do to enforce the promises made by Stalin at Yalta. The formulation by American delegation member James F. Byrnes, soon to be secretary of state (1945–47), was apt: “It was not a question of what we would let the Russians do, but what we could get the Russians to do.”",CREDIBLE

(Berlin) – Russian courts have issued the first known extremism convictions arising from the 2023 Supreme Court ruling designating the “international LGBT movement” as extremist, Human Rights Watch said today. The Supreme Court ruling, which was handed down on November 30 but became public only in mid-January 2024, indicates that many more convictions may follow. The Supreme Court ruling also declared the rainbow flag a forbidden symbol of the “LGBT movement.” Displaying the flag is the basis for administrative penalties in at least three cases that courts have tried in recent weeks. In late January, a court in Nizhny Novgorod sentenced a woman to five days detention for wearing rainbow-colored earrings after an individual accosted her and her friend in a cafe. Also in late January, a judge in Volgograd region handed down a fine over a rainbow flag published on a social media page. In early February, a court in Saratov fined a woman for posting a rainbow flag on social media. “The Supreme Court decision opened the floodgates to allow arbitrary prosecution of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people, along with anyone who defends their rights or expresses solidarity with them,” said Tanya Lokshina, associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “For years, Russian authorities tried to erase LGBT visibility, and now they have criminalized it.” At least three groups supporting LGBT rights have shut down their operations for fear of prosecution. Other consequences of the ruling have included a series of police raids of gay clubs, incidents of self-censorship, and an uptick in requests for legal advice from remaining LGBT support groups, which have now turned to working clandestinely. The Supreme Court ruling and prosecutions flowing from it are discriminatory, violate a wide range of rights, and should be overturned, Human Rights Watch said. Under Russian criminal law, a person found guilty of displaying extremist group symbols faces up to 15 days in detention for the first offense and up to four years in prison for a repeat offense. Participating in or financing an extremist organization is punishable by up to 12 years in prison. The authorities may include individuals suspected of involvement with an extremist organization in the countrywide “list of extremists” and freeze their bank accounts. People deemed to be involved with an extremist organization are barred from running for public office. Draft legislation further expanding the notion of “justifying extremism” has passed first reading in Russia’s parliament. The Supreme Court’s perverse decision to accept the “international public LGBT movement” as a fictional defendant in this case was compounded by their denial of all requests by LGBT activists to participate, followed by the claim that “the defendant party failed to appear.” The court also refused to consider numerous appeals lodged by LGBT rights activists, saying that only the parties to the case had the right to appeal the ruling. By using the twisted legal fiction that there was an identifiable defendant called the “international LGBT movement” to contest the case, the Supreme Court denied all Russian LGBT persons and their allies directly impacted by the decision any due process rights, including by refusing to disclose the text of the judgment or reasons for the decision. The text of the ruling, which was later seen by a regional media outlet in the course of a court case and published in January, states that the rainbow flag is the movement’s symbol. Because Russian law enforcement practice treats even old social media posts that are still available online as grounds for prosecution, thousands of people, and most likely more, who have posted the rainbow flag over the years face the risk of prosecution. The ruling states that 281 “active participants” in the movement have been personally identified, but it does not clarify how or by whom. The Supreme Court ruling is the most recent example of authorities’ long record of misusing Russia’s broad and vague anti-extremism legislation to prosecute peaceful critics and members of certain religious groups, Human Rights Watch said. Hundreds of people have been wrongfully prosecuted under criminal extremism legislation, according to the SOVA Research Center and the list of political prisoners released by prominent human rights group Memorial. Since a court banned three organizations affiliated with political opposition leader Aleksey Navalny as “extremist” in 2021, Navalny and five of his supporters have been sentenced to prison on a range of extremism charges for legitimate activism, while dozens more have received fines and short-term jail sentences. Six members of Vesna, a democratic youth movement, have been in pretrial custody since June 2023 on various spurious charges, including extremism. Hundreds of Jehovah’s Witnesses have been jailed since the organization was banned as “extremist” in 2017. The Supreme Court ruling has drawn strong criticism internationally. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights deplored the ruling, stating that “the law must never be used to perpetuate inequality and discrimination,” and saying that Russia should repeal laws that discriminate against LGBT people. Five UN human rights experts reminded Russian authorities that under international human rights law, peaceful advocacy and expression of sexual orientation and gender identity can neither be considered “extremist” nor legitimate grounds for administrative and criminal prosecution. “The ruling has no basis in reality; it is filled with conspiracy theories, false and unsubstantiated claims, and hateful stereotypes; and it seeks to impose ‘traditional values’ ideology through repressive criminal law,” Lokshina said. “The only way to remedy this travesty of justice is to vacate the recent convictions and reverse the absurd ‘extremism’ designation.” For more details, please see below. Prosecutions On January 25, a court in Volzhskiy, Volgograd region, handed down the first known conviction following the Supreme Court ruling, punishing a man for posting the rainbow flag on social media. In an administrative case against Artyom Pogrebnyak, the prosecution alleged that he published the “flag of the international public LGBT movement” on his social media page, where he “stored it with the intent of mass distribution.” The judge found him guilty of displaying extremist symbols and fined him 1,000 rubles (about US$11). On January 31, a court in Nizhny Novgorod sentenced Anastasia Ershova to five days in detention for allegedly “displaying extremist symbols” by wearing rainbow-colored earrings. On February 13, a judge in Nizhny Novgorod upheld her conviction. Egida, a group providing emergency assistance on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity that is representing Ershova, said they would continue fighting the decision. Ershova’s lawyer said that on January 29, a man had aggressively approached her and a friend in a cafe in Nizhny Novgorod and demanded that they take down “illegal symbols,” referring to a blue and yellow pin—the colors of the Ukrainian flag—from the sweater that her friend was wearing. The video of the incident circulated online shows the assailant physically and verbally attacking the two young people using homophobic slurs, ripping the pin, and threatening to send the video to the anti-extremism police. The text of the court decision notes that law enforcement officers examined the video the same day. Instead of investigating the assault, the police identified Ershova and arrested her for wearing rainbow-colored earrings the next day. On January 18, First Department, a human rights project specializing in treason and high-profile extremism cases, said the police in Saratov had charged a photographer, Inna Mosina, with publishing an “extremist” rainbow flag on her Instagram account. Mosina had deleted her social media accounts after getting a call from the police in January and told the court that one of the posts in question was three years old. On February 5, a court in Saratov found her guilty and fined her 1,500 rubles (about $16.50). Her lawyer said he would appeal the decision. Other Consequences On November 30, just after the Supreme Court decision, Delo LGBT+, a legal collective established in 2022 to defend pro bono the rights of LGBT people, announced its dissolution. It had handled more than 200 legal cases, including successfully representing trans people in lawsuits seeking changes to the gender markers in their identity documents and winning acquittals for people accused of spreading “propaganda” for “non-traditional sexual relations.” At least two queer community centers also shut down following the decision. QDeer, a center in Nizhny Novgorod, said that continuing to operate would jeopardize their team and visitors. Rainbow World (Radyzhniy Mir), an LGBT group based in Perm, said they also made the “difficult” decision to shut down operations. Days after the Supreme Court’s ruling, the police raided gay clubs in Moscow, Yekaterinburg, and Krasnoyarsk, where they shut down events, recorded visitors’ personal data, and photographed their passports. In one of the raids, police arrested more than 20 guests, later releasing them. St. Petersburg’s oldest gay club said they were forced to shut down after the owners of the building canceled the lease in light of the “extremism” decision. People detained during these raids, whose data the police recorded, remain at risk of multiple forms of targeted discrimination from both private parties and the police under broad “extremism” legislation and data leaks. In December, a Russian rock band censored a mention of the rainbow flag in one of their songs on streaming platforms. A philologist in Moscow said in January that she was specifically asked not to talk about feminine forms of certain nouns at her book presentation in a government-owned bookstore “due to the recent events and to avoid unpleasant incidents.” Russian nouns are gendered, and many professions, for example, are “masculine”; to support gender equality, some people have started using “feminine” versions of such nouns. Students in a St. Petersburg university have also faced pressure not to use such feminized nouns from university administrators. Supreme Court Decision The Supreme Court ruling stemmed from a lawsuit that the Russian Justice Ministry filed on November 2. While the ruling was handed down on November 30, its text became public only after the police submitted it into evidence in the prosecution of Mosina, the photographer. In mid-January, Svobodnye Novosti (Free News), a Saratov-based outlet, published it in full. The ruling, along with the manner in which the court reached it, violates multiple rights guaranteed by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Russia is a party, including the rights to freedom of expression, opinion, association and assembly, privacy, due process, remedy, equality, and nondiscrimination. The authorities’ actions, described above, to sanction individuals based on the ruling, which was not made publicly available, additionally violate the prohibitions on arbitrary detention, arbitrary application of criminal law due to a lack of a sound legal basis, and retroactive application of criminal law. The ruling also threatens other fundamental rights, such as the rights to health and education protected by the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), another treaty to which Russia is a party. False Claims and Conspiracy Theories The ruling contains false claims that non-heterosexual relations are “unnatural,” that the LGBT movement appeared in the US as part of population control policy, and that the LGBT community and their supporters resort to oppression, violence, and discrimination. The judgment contends that people within the movement are united by specific morals, customs, lifestyle, common interests and needs, including as an example the use of gender-inclusive language for words such as “manager.” It calls the LGBT movement an “inherently destructive ideological mechanism of influence,” which facilitates the “self-destruction of society, weakens family ties, harms moral health, and imposes ideas that imply the denial of human dignity and the value of human life.” The court also baselessly attacks the LGBT movement’s advocacy for equality regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity as promoting their “superiority.” Suppressing LGBT Rights Under the Guise of Child Protection The Supreme Court’s ruling also brings together arguments previously used by government officials and politicians seeking to rationalize repression against LGBT people, including claiming the ruling will protect the rights of children and counter the “demographic” threat ostensibly posed by LGBT relationships. The ruling is premised on the notion that educating children on sexuality and demonstrating points of view different than those generally accepted in Russian society can provoke children’s “social alienation” and hinder their development. The best available evidence and applicable international standards do not support such a finding. Reinforcing the Prohibition of Dissent The decision also reinforces Russian authorities’ practice of classifying peaceful opposition as a form of “extremism” by identifying criticism of the government’s repressive policies and practices as “the most striking manifestation of the Movement’s extremist activities.” It accuses Russian LGBT rights groups of smearing Russia’s international reputation by submitting “distorted information about the rights of people who identify themselves as LGBT” to UN treaty bodies, urging Russia to repeal its “gay propaganda” legislation, and promoting children’s unhindered access to information about sexual orientation and gender identity. Opening the Floodgates In light of the ruling, people who have posted rainbow flags on their social media accounts now face the risk of administrative prosecution and, if they are found to be repeat offenders, criminal prosecution. The Supreme Court ruling also stated that authorities had identified 281 “active participants in the movement.” These as yet publicly unnamed individuals could be at risk of criminal prosecution under Criminal Code article 282.2, which punishes participation in an extremist organization with up to 6 years in prison, with up to 10 years for organizers of such communities. Igor Galushkin, media coordinator for the emergency assistance group Egida, said that they saw a sharp increase in requests for legal advice and help with emigration after the court announced on November 17 that it would hear the case, with requests through the end of December amounting to 30 percent of all requests in 2023. He said that many LGBT organizations either shut down or now work clandestinely, and the ruling is a significant blow to their ability to raise funds in Russia. The organizations Sphere, Queer Svit, and Coming Out said they also experienced an increase in requests for emergency emigration. On November 29, prior to the Supreme Court ruling but after the court had denied his request to participate in the case as someone affected by the proceedings, a prominent Russian LGBT rights defender, Igor Kochetkov, joined by four others, announced the creation of an organization called “the international public LGBT movement,” the same name as the ostensible defendant in the case before the court. The activists said they had to create an actual organization of that name because otherwise the case was solely against an entity whose “existence is nothing more than make-believe of proponents of everything patriarchal and traditional.” The Supreme Court denied the newly created organization’s request to participate in the proceedings. The ruling said that the individuals and organizations who had sent the court “procedural statements” asking to be included in the proceedings and “identifying themselves as members of the LGBT community” had explicitly expressed full support for the movement’s “extremist activities.” Therefore, these individuals, whose names are not in the public domain, now also appear to be at risk of criminal prosecution. Such threatening language could also have implications for Memorial Human Rights Defence Centre, the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize co-laureate; Coming Out, an LGBTQ+ initiative; and six other human rights organizations that jointly submitted a third-party intervention to the Supreme Court on November 28 urging the court reject the Justice Ministry’s lawsuit. The groups said that the “movement,” as defined by Russian law, does not exist as an organized association, further evidenced by the fact that the Justice Ministry could not identify a defendant to take part in the proceedings. In essence, they said, a decision to ban a non-existent group following a closed hearing would criminalize activism and human rights work in support of LGBT people and lead to completely arbitrary application and legal uncertainty. They said that the lawsuit violated a litany of rights, including the rights to free expression, association, and nondiscrimination. The submission referred to a Constitutional Court ruling stating that the constitution does not allow banning public discussion of sexual relations, including non-traditional relations, or public discussion of the rights, freedoms, and interests of sexual minorities. Finally, they said that a ruling against the LGBT movement and enforcement of “traditional values” through criminal law would violate the constitutional ban on establishing a state ideology, have a chilling effect on speech, and fuel further discrimination, including violent hate crimes. The Supreme Court refused to accept the submission and failed to consider any of its arguments. In a statement following the Supreme Court judgment, Memorial said that “the case combines the worst of practices created and developed by the Russian authorities in recent years,” affecting all LGBT people, organizations, activists, and allies, aiming to erase them from public space. Other Laws and Repressive Measures Russia has long used other tools in its repressive arsenal to crack down on LGBT activism and queer people. Key among them was the 2013 “gay propaganda” ban, which purported to protect children from “propaganda,” broadly defined to mean any positive or neutral depiction or discussion of non-heterosexual relations. A December 2022 law extended this to a blanket ban, covering all public information or pro-LGBT activities for people of all ages, while maintaining aggravated penalties when children are involved. The legislation aimed to further isolate children from any information on sexual orientation and gender identity, including gender transition. It introduced fines up to the equivalent of US$8,700 for individuals and $54,000 for legal entities, such as nongovernmental groups, for disseminating such information. The legislation classified displays of non-heterosexual relations or orientations as “information harmful to children’s health and development” and envisaged blocking websites and other online sources hosting information about LGBT people. It did not provide any exclusions for art, scientific studies, or education. Russian authorities have opened dozens of prosecutions against companies for running movies, shows, and music clips featuring non-heterosexual relations or queer people. The authorities also used the “propaganda” law to prosecute people for protesting anti-LGBT laws or having profiles in gay dating apps, as well as to fine and deport transgender sex workers. Russia’s media and communications watchdog blocked the websites of LGBT rights groups and dating services. Foreign Agents Since 2013, the Justice Ministry has designated at least 22 groups supporting LGBT people as “foreign agents,” including 17 in the past three years. This has prompted several groups to shut down. The foreign agents’ register also includes at least 18 prominent artists, journalists, and LGBT activists. The Justice Ministry said 12 of those on the list were there for promoting LGBT relations and claimed that their actions “contradic[t] the state policy of safeguarding and strengthening traditional Russian moral and spiritual values and constitutional priorities in protecting family, motherhood and childhood.” When one blogger appealed the designation, the ministry argued in court that he had spoken on his YouTube channel about homophobia and called for tolerance toward members of the LGBT community. Over the past three years, the authorities have imposed at least three dozen administrative fines on these groups and individuals for alleged failures to comply with labelling and reporting requirements. Some are now facing prison sentences for repeat violations.",CREDIBLE

A new cycle of violence, hatred, and revenge has increasingly engulfed the entire Middle East, bringing the region is to the brink of an all-out war. In this dangerous context, the death of Yahya Sinwar should mark a turning point. He was an EU-listed terrorist, responsible for the heinous attack of 7 October, and one of the obstacles to the urgently needed ceasefire and the unconditional release of all hostages. There must now be an end to the wars in Gaza, the West bank and in Lebanon, The hostages must be freed and the suffering of the Palestinian people must end. As I outlined to the Members of the European Parliament, the EU needs to work on five dimensions: 1. Israel has a right and duty to protect its citizens As former Defence Minister Gantz recently wrote, Israel’s trauma extends beyond the events of 7 October 2023. It covers not only the 1,200 dead and 250 hostages, of whom around 100 are still held captive, but also the immediate Hezbollah attack on northern Israel, forcing 70,000 Israelis to leave their homes. Additionally there were also Iran’s attacks – first on 13 April and then on 1 October, forcing millions of Israelis into bomb shelters. We have immediately, and repeatedly condemned these attacks in the strongest possible terms and recognised Israel’s right and duty to defend and protect its citizens against terrorist attacks. Israel cannot look to its future without ensuring that 7 October will never be repeated. 2. Every right has its limits However, like any right, the inherent right to defend oneself against attacks has its limits. We cannot ignore the fact that 7 October was also the beginning of other tragedies and horrors. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the course of Israel’s military retaliation; almost 100,000 Palestinians have been injured, 60 % of the buildings in the enclave destroyed. Kamala Harris recently stated that “no food has entered northern Gaza in nearly 2 weeks”. Almost the entire population of Gaza is displaced and malnourished, humanitarian access has reached a new low, famine and disease are spreading. Almost everything that makes a society function has been reduced to rubble. There is a right to self-defence, but there is no right to revenge. We are now increasingly seeing Israel replicating this conduct of war in the West Bank and Lebanon. In the West Bank, which is under illegal occupation and where illegal settlers have been spreading terror among local communities with total impunity, we are now witnessing Israeli airstrikes and the destruction of civilian infrastructure. The bombing of the Tulkarem refugee camp, killing 18 people, was the deadliest in the occupied West Bank in two decades. The disproportionate manner in which Israel has been operating in Gaza does not bode well for the protection of civilians in the West Bank and Lebanon. It has to stop. 3. Delivering humanitarian assistance The European Union has been providing over € 330 million humanitarian assistance to Gaza in 2023 and 2024. We have sent more than 60 flights in our humanitarian airlift and have activated our Civil Protection Unit more than ten times since 7 October. Together with the Member States, we are the largest donors of humanitarian aid to Gaza. However, this humanitarian aid must be distributed on the ground. UNRWA is the only UN agency able to provide essential services to millions of Palestinians in Gaza at the required scale. Across the region, it delivers food, shelter, and healthcare to a majority of Gaza’s population and over 650,000 children attend its schools. The draft bill on banning UNRWA, currently discussed in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, is very alarming. If passed, it may bring down the humanitarian response in Gaza and would have disastrous consequences for the civilian population of the enclave and of the West Bank. Banning the very organisation that ensures that Palestine refugees receive quality education and healthcare will only worsen an already tense situation, with negative consequences not only for Palestinians, but also for Israel and eventually Europe. 4. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict needs a political solution What we need most urgently now is a ceasefire and the return of a political process, in Gaza as well as in Lebanon. No military action alone can bring a safe future to the people of the region. No military action can be legitimate in the absence of any attempt at finding a political solution to the conflict that caused it. Only a political settlement will bring security and peace. However, never before has there been so little prospect for a political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We all know the parameters for resolving this conflict. The international community has backed it many times, overwhelmingly: it is the establishment of a state for each of the two peoples. One state already exists, a strong state with immense military and economic capacity. The other does not. Unfortunately, this solution – the only one we know that could bring peace – does not have the support of one of the most critical parties to the conflict: the current Israeli government. Yet, this should not stop us from preparing a better future. This is why, in September, on the sidelines of the last UN General Assembly, I launched together with Prince Faisal from Saudi Arabia and Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide from Norway a Global Alliance for the Implementation of the Two-State Solution. A total of 90 UN Member States and intergovernmental organisations and almost 60 foreign ministers from around the world attended. This Global Alliance will serve as an umbrella, under which each participant will contribute to incentivise the implementation of the two-state solution. This ranges from the 'unprecedented package of political, economic and security support' that the EU promised already eleven years ago, to support for Palestinian state-building, contributions to regional security, or a concrete plan for regional cooperation. We will organise in coming weeks a series of working meetings, starting in Riyadh and Brussels. We also need to foster dialogue between the civil societies of Israel, Palestine, and Europe. We have already convened three such meetings. On 27 October, we will do so again in Barcelona, within the framework of the Union for the Mediterranean. It may seem naïve to think that, after so much confrontation, so much pain, and so much hatred, it might be possible to build bridges between these two peoples. But as Yitzhak Rabin told us, “You don't make peace with friends. You make it with your enemies”. I believe it is Europe's responsibility - and interest - to help both peoples move from mutual rejection to mutual recognition. 5. We must avoid further regional escalation We cannot abandon Lebanon. It was already a deeply destabilized country. Additionally, the Israeli ground invasion already killed 2,500 Lebanese and has displaced 20% of the population, a total of 1,2 million people. Lebanon has been threatened to be “turned into a second Gaza”. This new war has already created tremendous human suffering and could at any moment spread in the whole region. The EU has already mobilised €40 million in humanitarian aid to assist those affected and will continue to work relentless towards a ceasefire, supporting the mediation efforts led by France and the United States. However, without a strong commitment to political reform from the Lebanese political class there is no long-term solution for Lebanon. It is on them to take control of the state and lead. This must begin with the election of a President of the Republic, a process, which has been stalled for more than two years. The Lebanese army must return to southern Lebanon. The UNSC Resolution 1701 provides the legal framework for this redeployment. Through the European Peace Facility, we are currently helping the Lebanese Army build the capacity it needs to protect the country’s borders. With the shelling of UNFIL units – and wounding of four soldiers - the Israel Defence Forces have crossed a red line. All 27 EU Member States have condemned it, nobody is asking for UNFIL to withdraw. In the future, UNIFIL should be given a stronger mandate to ensure peace at the border. Israel needs to withdraw from Lebanese territory. Israel has already invaded Lebanon three times: in 1978, from 1982 to 2000, and in 2006. Each time, these tactical victories have evolved at the end of the day in strategic defeats for Israel. Even within Israel’s own security establishment, some have argued that these invasions not only failed to make Israel safer, they destabilised Israel’s northern border and strengthened Hezbollah. What would make anybody believe that another military occupation will yield largely different results? History has shown that there are no military solutions to the deeply rooted conflicts in the Middle East – not in Gaza, not in the West Bank, not in Lebanon. Peace is the only long-term security guarantee. Israel’s peace agreements with Jordan and Egypt have demonstrated this for decades. They should serve as blueprints, including with a Palestinian state. It is time to give peace a chance.",CREDIBLE

PGNiG agrees with the position of the UOKiK President. In 2015, Gazprom, Shell, Uniper, Engie, OMV and Wintershall filed a merger application with the UOKiK President for consent to establish a joint venture – the operator of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. The UOKiK President issued objections regarding the application, pointing that the construction of Nord Stream 2 posed a threat to competition. As a result, the application was withdrawn, but the companies did not give up their cooperation and – in place of the previous consortium agreement – concluded agreements on the financing of a gas pipeline operator and proceeded with the project. From the very beginning of Nord Stream 2 project, PGNiG pointed to its negative impact on competition and security of gas supplies in Central and Eastern Europe, particularly on the Polish market. The company indicated the harmful effect of the Nord Stream 2 project on competition in, among others, the antitrust proceedings conducted by the European Commission against Gazprom, the derogation proceedings before BNetzA, and in the positions submitted to the UOKiK President as part of antitrust proceedings, including the proceedings concluded with the today’s decision of the UOKiK President. Similarly to the UOKIK President, PGNiG perceives the change of the Nord Stream 2 financing model as an attempt to bypass the objections raised by the UOKiK President in 2016 to the concentration consisting in the establishment of Nord Stream 2 AG. In its position submitted to the UOKiK President, PGNiG argued that, considering all the key features of the transaction, as a result of signing and proceeding to perform the agreements on financing the construction of Nord Stream 2, the intended concentration in fact materialised and a joint venture was established. According to the information presented at the UOKiK President’s conference, the UOKiK President recognized PGNiG’s arguments. PGNiG considers that the decision of the UOKiK President will significantly contribute to protecting competition in the gas market in Europe. The decision shows that any actions aimed at circumventing the law and harming competition are unacceptable, and that all businesses, regardless of the country they are based in, must act in accordance with the law and comply with their legal obligations. In this context, it is also important to recall the efforts, as yet unsuccessful, made by Gazprom and its business partners to convince the Member States and the EU Institutions that Nord Stream 2 is not subject to the European Union’s Third Energy Package. This shows that Nord Stream 2 is not just an ordinary business venture, but a project founded on the assumption that the laws of the Member States or the laws of the European Union can be circumvented. PGNiG is of the opinion that it is necessary to stop further work on the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is a project contrary to the Treaty’s principle of solidarity in energy matters and detrimental to security of supplies and competition. In the Company’s view, the Nord Stream 2 project participants should, implementing today’s decision of the UOKiK President, terminate the Nord Stream 2 financing agreements. Meanwhile, PGNiG declares that it will use all available legal means to counteract the adverse consequences of the Nord Stream 2 project.",CREDIBLE

However, thanks to Russia’s invasion, that is exactly what has happened. Zelensky’s term officially ended yesterday and the presidential election which would have, under peacetime conditions, been held in March has been postponed under the martial law imposed over the past two years of war. In the President’s defence, organising an election during a war would be challenging, given the logistical difficulties of heading to the polls when a significant number of voters are abroad, on the frontline or living under Russian occupation. That is before turning to the issue of how to convince the electorate of the legitimacy of any result, given the almost-certain risk of Russian disinformation and manipulation. Add to that the additional threat of Moscow taking advantage of the distraction generated by an election, and it’s easy to see the rationale for a delay. Yet, by simply remaining in power, Ukraine’s wartime leader is finding himself under attack from his domestic opponents. Back in December, Kyiv Mayor and Zelensky rival Vitali Klitschko warned that Ukraine was sliding towards authoritarianism and predicted that “at some point we will no longer be any different from Russia, where everything depends on the whim of one man”. The expiration of Zelensky’s formal mandate can only add fuel to the fire, as domestic challengers eager for their own chance to sit at the top table paint the incumbent as an illegitimate autocrat hooked on power. In March, ex-parliamentarian Hryhoriy Omelchenko published a letter questioning the legal basis for Zelensky to remain in post after 20 May under the Ukrainian constitution, urging him “not to usurp state power” but instead resign voluntarily on schedule. Even those querulous voices in Ukraine are nothing compared to what the true adversary is saying. The Kremlin has already been pushing the line that, after 20 May, Zelensky loses his legitimacy as leader. In February, Ukrainian MP and alleged Russian agent Oleksandr Dubinsky stated that “after May 20th, the Rada is legitimate but the President is not”, claims which were gleefully repeated by Russian state news agency TASS. Putin also raised the issue of Zelensky’s legitimacy after this date during last week’s visit to China. Zelensky has made the defence of democratic values and freedom central to his own fight against Moscow. However, the “whataboutism” and accusations of hypocrisy so beloved of the Kremlin mean that Russia will likely now ask how a leader who refuses to hold an election can portray himself as a guardian of democracy. While March’s presidential election in Russia was clearly a sham — the intimidation and vote-rigging were straight from the Kremlin playbook — it did take place, allowing Putin to now claim that he, not Zelensky, is the legitimately elected president who holds a democratic mandate from his people. Perhaps even more dangerous than Zelensky’s enemies are his allies, some of whom are already impatiently demanding to know what plan the Ukrainian leadership has for going to the ballot box. In May 2023 Tiny Kox, a Dutch politician and then-President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe urged Ukraine to find a way to hold an election, possibly by amending the constitution. In August, US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham pushed for Ukraine to head to the polls in 2024, promising Zelensky that the US would keep weapons flowing before adding that “we need an election in Ukraine”. This goes to show how easily the issue can be weaponised. For all the opprobrium of his critics, Zelensky has not rejected having an election at some point in the future, saying in November that it was “not the right time”. The Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found in February that only 15% of Ukrainians want elections under the current circumstances, while Ukraine’s constitution states that the president exercises their powers until the assumption of office by their newly-elected successor.",CREDIBLE

In what appears to be a deeply unfair election riddled with irregularities, Venezuela’s authoritarian president, Nicolás Maduro, seems to have survived once again. The outcome, which is already facing challenges and unrest that could grow in the coming days, is not just a disappointment for the opposition and the millions of Venezuelans yearning for democratic change. The election was a crucial test of the durability of the new brand of authoritarianism gripping the Americas — and it has proved that the movement may not fade away anytime soon. Across the Western Hemisphere, democracy is being snuffed out or seriously challenged. Over the past 20 years, Venezuela, Nicaragua and El Salvador have slid into dictatorships. In late 2022, Peru’s president sought to dissolve its legislature, although he landed in jail. Guatemala had a close call last year, with the attorney general’s office attempting to prevent a peaceful transition of power. And it remains to be seen whether Mexico’s recently elected president, Claudia Sheinbaum, will continue the erosion of democratic checks and balances that her predecessor began. It’s not a universally grim picture. Elsewhere — in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and the United States — democracy is succeeding. But it is being tested as the opposition to pluralism and inclusion grows and social unrest and dissatisfaction with the government spread against a backdrop of stark inequality and institutional instability. Venezuela’s election is a fulcrum moment for the Americas. Despite high turnout, there were numerous reports of voting irregularities, voter intimidation and problems at voting centers. Nevertheless, with 80 percent of the votes counted, the nation’s electoral council declared Mr. Maduro the winner with 51.2 percent of the vote compared with 44.2 percent for his main rival. Because officials at many voting centers refused to hand over paper copies of the vote tallies, the opposition had no concrete way to point to a different outcome. Advertisement If Mr. Maduro can ride out the postelection turmoil and remain in office another full term, it will be a green light to other budding autocrats in the region that they, too, can act with near impunity. Sham elections, human rights abuses and corruption could spread if there is not organized international pushback against them, while the voices of domestic constituencies are weakened by repression. The backsliding of democracy happened before: Many nascent democracies in Latin America collapsed during the Cold War only to be resurrected after its end. So far, Mr. Maduro has done everything he can to cling to power. Before the election, his government barred the opposition’s most popular candidate from running for president, made it harder for millions of Venezuelans living abroad to vote and used state resources to dominate media coverage and run his campaign. He even tried to rebrand himself as more likable on social media to connect with voters who are too young to remember when Venezuela was a flourishing democracy.

https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/the-swiss-peace-conference-was-a-propaganda-event/,https://russiaun.ru/en/news/2110424,2024-04-11,"Statement by Permanent Representative Vassily Nebenzia at UNSC briefing on Ukraine Mme.President, We understand perfectly well that the only reason for convening today's meeting is the desire of the Western sponsors of the Kiev regime to keep the Ukrainian issue ""afloat"" in the UN Security Council in a particular way they need. It implies condemnation of the strikes carried out by the Russian Aerospace forces against facilities related to the military potential of Zelensky’s regime and a grotesque representation of their consequences for the civilian population. It all looks very unconvincing, especially against the backdrop of Israel's ongoing slaughter in the Gaza Strip. Mme.President, As usual, EU members have signed up en masse to speak at this meeting. It is obvious that we will hear nothing new from them. But we look forward to their active participation in tomorrow's meeting to convene at our initiative. As for the massive precision strikes against Ukrainian fuel and energy facilities, they are a response to attempts by the Kiev regime to damage Russian oil and gas and energy infrastructure. The strike did achieve its goal, having disrupted the work of Ukrainian military industry enterprises and the transfer of reserves to combat areas. It also hampered the supply of fuel to the UAF. As in all previous cases, the civilian population was not threatened by the Russian military, no matter how much Zelensky’s regime and its Western sponsors try to prove the opposite. What also gets in the way of Western propaganda makers is the opinions of ordinary Ukrainians, which they share on social networks, urging their compatriots to fear not Russian precision strikes but the consequences of the work of Ukrainian air defense systems that are deployed in residential areas in violation of IHL norms. Since Ukraine (as it now recognizes) has fewer air defense systems, there have also been fewer incidents due to their use. Ordinary citizens of Ukraine also noticed that. Incidentally, the Ukrainian military have begun to complain openly that local residents in Kharkov, Odessa, Nikolaev, Dnepropetrovsk and other cities and regions of Ukraine have started to actively share with Russian military the coordinates of UAF arms depots and whereabouts of military reserves, which clearly demonstrates the real attitude of the civilian population to what is happening. Ordinary Ukrainians have come to realize more clearly who their real enemy is and who poses a real, not an imaginary, threat to their lives. We can understand them, because they are concerned about things that our Western colleagues did not mention today. For example, they have not said a word about violations of the rights of Ukrainian men of conscription age during their forced mobilization. This is a real scourge for Ukrainian families today. More and more evidence is being published on the Internet that military commissions mistreat Ukrainian men. In violation of all norms and laws, they seize them in the streets as if they were wanted criminals and send them straight to the front (without any special training) where the only way to survive is to surrender to the Russian troops. The latter is not that easy though, because of barrier squads consisting of nationalists, who try to avoid direct combat with the Russian troops, preferring to shoot their compatriots in the back. At the same time, whoever has money and connections, like MPs and officials, evade conscription themselves and take their relatives of conscription age abroad. In Vinnitsa region, a ban was imposed on the entry of men of conscription age into the areas bordering Moldova in order to prevent them from fleeing. As we see from a video report published recently by the German Deutsche Welle, in many Ukrainian villages there is simply no one left to conscript. In the village of Luzanovka (Cherkassy Region), with the population of 400 people, about 50 men have been conscripted. Head of the local Council complains that they do not have anyone to do the grave digging. And this happens all across Ukraine against the backdrop of the frank unwillingness of the overwhelming majority of Ukrainians to fight for Western geopolitical interests. As President of the Kiev International Institute of Sociology admitted the other day, only 8% of men who had been surveyed are ready to voluntarily join the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Kiev regime rightly sees this as a lethal threat to its power and therefore ""tightens the screws"" in every possible way. Thus, at the beginning of the month, the conscription age for Ukrainians was lowered from 27 down to 25, and, judging by the progress of Ukrainian troops at the front, it may soon be 17-18 years old. In his moment of agony, Hitler is known to have relied on ""Hitlerjugend"" for the defense of Berlin. Zelensky's agonizing regime is ready to do the same, and sacrifices not only Ukrainian men, but women too for the interests of others. The law on mobilization, which is about to be adopted, will completely turn Ukrainians into serfs whose lives are at the disposal of Zelensky and his clique. However, our Western colleagues prefer to keep silent about this. Just as they never admit how they were preparing Ukraine for a war with Russia for many years under the cover of the Minsk Agreements; and how they did not allow Ukrainians to make peace with Russia Of course, no one said today that the human rights situation in Ukraine continues to deteriorate rapidly. None of Western sponsors dares to criticize the head of the Kiev regime, who has usurped power, canceled elections and thrown into prison everyone who disagrees with his dictatorship. Meanwhile, neo-Nazism is being more and more blatantly promoted in Ukraine, where accomplices of the Nazis are glorified; nationalist and racist sentiments are being cultivated among the population. Large-scale persecution of canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church continues. The Kiev regime takes pains to create an image of the UOC and its ministers as ""collaborators of the enemy"" and encourages illegal seizure of churches. Everything Russian (language, culture, education, media) is automatically subjected to ""cancellation"". Let me give just one example. Last week, the odious Institute of National Memory declared the Kiev-born writer Mikhail Bulgakov, who lived in the 19th and 20th centuries and died in 1940, to be an ""ardent Ukrainophobe"" and equated the use of the writer's name with ""propaganda of Russian imperial policy"". In particular, the world-famous writer is accused of being ""the closest of all Russian writers of that time to the current ideologues of Putinism and the Kremlin's justification of ethnocide in Ukraine"". This is not something that a mentally healthy person would ever write. They would not fight art, destroy books and burn them in city squares. Only Nazis in the 30s-40s of the 20th century did that. And their ideological heirs are doing the same thing in Ukraine today, glorifying Bandera, Shukhevych and all those who helped the German Nazis during the war to kill Jews, Poles, Russians, Roma, and Ukrainians too. And today's Germans and others in the West, instead of words of condemnation, play deaf-and-dumb and supply the leader of the Kiev clique with weapons helping him to kill civilians. We will talk about this in detail at a separate meeting that we have requested for tomorrow. Our Western colleagues got so accustomed to disregarding any crimes and ugly doings of the Kiev regime that they manage to ignore even the direct shelling and drone attacks on the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant, which resumed a few days ago and which risk causing a nuclear catastrophe in the very center of Europe. We will raise this topic during the special meeting on April 15. We hope that IAEA (whose staff are present at the ZNPP and can observe Ukrainian provocations with their own eyes) will also give a fair assessment to those developments. Colleagues, All this is little encouraging, but there is good news too that instills optimism in all those who are tired of the Ukrainian crisis. Russian troops now advance in virtually all directions, destroying fortifications that have been constructed for years. There is a dramatic shift in the military actions that is taking place before our eyes, and neither Western aid packages nor ""meat assaults"" and counterattacks by the Kiev regime will be able to change this. This situation is extremely worrying for Zelensky’s Western sponsors, who have already set a new goal for themselves: ""to prevent Russia from winning"" instead of ""helping Kiev to defeat Russia"". Zelensky himself has also noticeably changed his rhetoric, warning his masters that Ukraine will lose without continued large-scale Western assistance. By doing so, he confirms what we have said repeatedly: Ukraine today is nothing more than a private military company that is fighting to the last Ukrainian for the West and with Western weapons. All that remains for the Kiev regime is to act, in a fit of impotent anger, in the worst terrorist traditions, purposefully shelling peaceful neighborhoods of Russian cities and committing real terrorist attacks. This is how it will go down in history: an inhuman and misanthropic regime of terrorists and Nazis who betrayed the interests of their people and sacrificed them for Western money and handouts for Zelensky and his inner circle. Under these conditions, the attempts of the head of the Kiev regime to promote his ""formulas"" and convene ""summits"" cause nothing but bewilderment. Soon enough, the only topic for any international meetings on Ukraine will be the unconditional surrender of the Kiev regime. My advice is that everyone should prepare for this in advance. Thank you.",CREDIBLE

While the outlet, RT, has previously been sanctioned for its work to spread Kremlin propaganda and disinformation, the new allegations suggest its role goes far beyond influence operations. Instead, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, RT is a key part of Russia’s war machine and its efforts to undermine its democratic adversaries. “RT wants its new covert intelligence capabilities, like its longstanding propaganda disinformation efforts, to remain hidden,” Blinken told reporters. “Our most powerful antidote to Russia’s lies is the truth. It’s shining a bright light on what the Kremlin is trying to do under the cover of darkness.” RT has also created websites posing as legitimate news sites to spread disinformation and propaganda in Europe, Africa, South America and elsewhere, officials said. They say the outlet has also expanded its use of cyber operations with a new unit with ties to Russian intelligence created last year. The crowd-sourcing effort ran on Russian social media platforms and sought to raise funds for military supplies, some of which were procured in China, officials said. There were no obvious connections between RT and the fundraising campaign, or any indication that Chinese officials knew their products were being sold to Russia. The list of supplies also included night-vision equipment, drones, radios and generators. RT’s actions show “it’s not just a firehouse of disinformation, but a fully-fledged member of the intelligence apparatus and operation of the Russian government,” said Jamie Rubin, who heads the State Department’s Global Engagement Center. President Putin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told The Associated Press that the allegations were “nonsense.” RT is “media” and “quite effective,” Peskov said. The sanctions announced Friday target RT’s parent organization, TV-Novosti, as well as a related state media group called Rossiya Segodnya and its general director Dmitry Kiselyov. A third organization and its leader, Nelli Parutenko, were also sanctioned for allegedly running a vote-buying scheme in Moldova designed to help Moscow’s preferred candidates in an upcoming election. Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova suggested the sanctions against RT were unnecessary because it has already been sanctioned. “I think a new profession should appear in the United States — a specialist in sanctions already imposed against Russia,” she wrote on her Telegram channel. Russia’s global propaganda work is receiving extra scrutiny in the months leading up to the U.S. election. Last week, the Biden administration seized Kremlin-run websites and charged two RT employees with covertly paying a Tennessee company nearly $10 million for its content. The company then paid several popular far-right influencers, whose content often mirrored Russian talking points. Two of the influencers said they had no idea their work was being supported by Russia. This summer, intelligence officials warned that Russia was using unwitting Americans to spread its propaganda by disguising it in English on sites popular with Americans. Officials say Russia seeks to divide Americans ahead of the election as a way of reducing support for Ukraine. Russia’s influence operations also appear designed to support former President Donald Trump, who has criticized Ukraine and the NATO alliance while praising Russian President Vladimir Putin. ___ Associated Press writer Emma Burrows contributed to this report from London.",CREDIBLE

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the crowdfunding site was used to purchase weapons and equipment, including drones, radio equipment, sniper rifles, suppressors, body armor, night vision equipment, diesel generators and personal weapon sights. “While the crowdfunding campaign is out in the open, what’s hidden is that this program is administered by the leaders of RT,” Blinken said. Additionally, State officials said that since 2023, Russian intelligence services were embedded within RT, operating as a unit with “cyber operational capabilities” to collect information on targets and feed Russian government influence and disinformation operations across the globe. Blinken said the evidence compiled by the U.S. government — some of which he said came directly from RT employees — demonstrates that RT and affiliates “are no longer merely firehoses of Russian propaganda and disinformation” but “functioning like a de facto arm” of the Russian government. The department placed sanctions on three entities for their roles in an alleged operation to influence upcoming presidential elections in Moldova and foment violent unrest: Rossiya Segodnya, a state-funded broadcast agency headquartered in Moscow, TV Novosti, a state-funded entity that officials said controlled RT’s media channels, and Ano Evraziya, which State described as a “vote-buying campaign” for pro-Kremlin candidates under the guise of humanitarian assistance. Additionally, the department placed Nelli Alekseyevna Parutenko, general director of Ano Evraziya, and Dmitry Konstantinovich Kiselev, general director of Rossiya Segodnya, on U.S. sanctions lists. News of the State Department’s actions was first reported by CNN. State officials that the announced sanctions were not for RT officials knowingly spreading Russian propaganda, something they said would still fall under the principles of free expression. Jim O’Brien, assistant secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, said the crowdfunding effort “wasn’t just some employees putting on a telethon” but a covert effort to help Russia procure arms. While State officials described this new organization as a “cyber” unit, it’s not clear from their descriptions whether the unit engaged in actual hacking or digital compromises of any victims or organizations. They cited two examples of the unit’s work: helping to manage the crowdsourcing website on social media and other platforms, and using “cyber tools” to gather information on behalf of the Russian government. Officials declined to answer whether the unit was still active within RT today. According to the fact sheet, the unit “has focused primarily on influence and intelligence operations all over the world. Under the cover of RT, information produced through this entity’s capabilities flows to Russia’s intelligence services, Russian media outlets, Russian mercenary groups, and other various state and proxy arms of the Russian Government.” The reference to an FSB unit created within RT is similar to allegations made by the FBI in July, when they announced the seizure of websites and social media accounts related to a Russian AI-powered bot farm targeting the U.S. 2024 elections. According to search warrants and affidavits, the FBI received information from another unnamed federal agency that RT’s deputy editor-in-chief pitched the outlet’s leadership on the development of a new AI software tool called Meliorator in 2022. The tool could create social media personas “en masse,” post content, mimic the tone of ordinary social media users and align the substance of their posts with other disinformation accounts and bots, according to the advisory. There was also evidence that program developers were working to expand its functionality to other social platforms. According to U.S. officials, leadership at RT approved the development of Meliorator, and less than a year later the project was folded into a new private intelligence organization created by the FSB and approved by top Kremlin leadership in order to sow discord in the United States, according to court documents. That timeline roughly lines up with the cyber unit described by State officials Friday. CyberScoop has reached out to the State Department for additional details. RT officials, who have responded to previous requests for comment with snarky or sarcastic replies, did not immediately respond to the latest charges when contacted by CyberScoop. Just last week, the U.S. government unveiled criminal charges and sanctions to 10 RT employees for their alleged roles in supporting Russian disinformation operations targeting the U.S. elections. That scheme involved using foreign shell companies and a fictitious investor to direct at least $10 million in foreign funds to an unnamed Tennessee media company — later identified as Tenet Media — in exchange for laundering pro-Russian propaganda through popular online conservative influencers. State officials said while those announcements were focused more on Russian operations targeting the U.S., their sanctions were designed to highlight Russia’s global role in influencing and undermining democracies around the world.",CREDIBLE

The EU is Georgia’s main trading partner, with a 20.5% share of its total trade (2022). The EU is also the largest provider of financial assistance to Georgia. For 2021-2024, EUR 340 million in funding has been allocated for Georgia. The priority areas cover the economy, institutions, the rule of law, security, the environment and climate resilience, digital transformation, gender equality and inclusive society. The EU-Georgia Association Council, which supervises the implementation of the Association Agreement, held its last meeting on 20 February 2024 in Brussels. Georgia’s political and economic transformation, which began in 1989, has been marked by civil war, territorial conflicts and severe economic downturns. Faced with Russia’s occupation of Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia, Georgians have pinned their hopes on moving closer to the EU and NATO. Following Ukraine’s bid to join the European Union, Georgia (alongside the Republic of Moldova) submitted its own application for candidate status on 3 March 2022. On 14 December 2023, the European Council decided to grant the status of candidate country to Georgia, on the understanding that the relevant steps set out in the Commission recommendation of 8 November 2023 are taken. In March 2024, the government approved the 2024 action plan for Georgia’s integration into the EU. The EU has repeatedly underlined its unwavering support for Georgia’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders, as underlined in the European Parliament resolution of 14 June 2018 on Georgian occupied territories 10 years after the Russian invasion and in its latest resolution of 28 February 2024 on the implementation of the common foreign and security policy. The EU supports the conflict resolution efforts made through the work of the EU Special Representative for the South Caucasus and the crisis in Georgia, the EU Monitoring Mission and the EU Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace, thus complementing the Geneva International Discussions. The annual EU-Georgia Strategic Security Dialogue is a sign of trust in relations between the two sides. Georgia has also made significant contributions to several EU common security and defence policy operations, based on a framework agreement for Georgia’s participation, which entered into force in 2014. On the other hand, Georgia has not aligned with EU-led sanctions against Russia and Belarus. In May 2023, the Georgian Government’s decision to resume flights to Russia raised doubts about its commitment to align with the EU. Georgia’s political and media landscapes remain extremely polarised. A series of questionable developments over the past couple of years have pointed to democratic backsliding and undermining of civil liberties. These include the shortcomings and instances of malpractices observed during the 2020 legislative elections and 2021 municipal elections, as well as several instances of verbal or physical assaults against journalists and media workers. Most recently, Georgia’s ruling party has re-introduced legislation that would tighten restrictions on civil society, despite human rights watchdogs and international partners expressing concern, including the EU and the US. If adopted, the proposed legislation would oblige civil society organisations receiving more than 20% of their funding from external sources to declare that they are ‘pursuing the interests of a foreign power’. Mass demonstrations have taken place in Georgia’s capital, Tbilisi, where demonstrators have demanded that the draft law be withdrawn, as they see it as seeking to discredit independent, foreign-funded organisations and media and as a move steering the country away from Europe and towards Russia. Constant tensions between the ruling majority and the opposition and a lack of transparency and inclusiveness have also often hampered the reform process. In October 2024, parliamentary elections are due to be held in Georgia, which will be a major test for Georgian democracy. The EU is concerned by a number of actions by the ruling majority, including ignoring recommendations of the Venice Commission on election law, its repeated attempts to pass a ‘foreign agents’ law and seemingly establishing closer relations with Russia while distancing itself from the West. At the same time, according to opinion polls, Georgian society largely supports Georgia joining the EU, even at the expense of cutting trade relations with Russia. Therefore, the upcoming elections are seen as pivotal for Georgia’s future. A. The European Parliament’s position and interparliamentary cooperation The European Parliament has always been a strong supporter of the Georgian people’s European aspirations. It has stressed the importance of implementing the relevant steps set out in the Commission recommendation of 8 November 2023, including those on fighting disinformation, aligning with the common foreign and security policy, improving the implementation of parliamentary oversight and addressing political polarisation, de-oligarchisation and anti-corruption. Additionally, on 9 June 2022, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on violations of media freedom and the safety of journalists in Georgia. In this document, Members denounced state capture by the Georgian Dream party and its founder, the oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, and deplored the significant deterioration of the media situation in the country. Bilateral inter-parliamentary relations are developed in the context of the Parliamentary Partnership Committee, which held its latest meeting on 8 June 2023. The participants acknowledged progress on harmonisation in technical areas, but Members of the European Parliament deplored the backsliding trend with respect to the rule of law, the independence and efficiency of the judiciary, labour law and non-discrimination. They called on their Georgian counterparts to work together, with civil society stakeholders, in order to tackle the 12 key priorities identified by the European Commission. They also took note of the further deterioration of the human rights situation in the occupied regions. On 14 December 2022, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the implementation of the EU Association Agreement with Georgia based on a report drafted by the standing rapporteur, MEP Sven Mikser (S&D, Estonia). While taking note of Georgia’s continued reforms, Members called for the more systematic involvement of civil society actors in decision-making and deplored the backsliding trends with respect to the rule of law, in particular the cases of politicised justice. The European Parliament also adopted two critical resolutions: on violations of media freedom and the safety of journalists in Georgia (9 June 2022) and on the situation of the former President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili (15 February 2023). When it comes to Parliament’s democracy support activities, Georgia has been a priority country since 2017. Georgia has, however, repeatedly refused to engage in a cooperation programme on the use of the parliamentary oversight mechanism, or in a Jean Monnet Dialogue to address the issue of chronic political polarisation, which has forced Parliament to scale down its ambitions until the parliamentary majority adopts a more constructive attitude. B. Election observation Georgia has hosted missions from the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), monitoring the country’s parliamentary, presidential and local elections since 1995. As usual in the OSCE area, European Parliament observers have been embedded in the OSCE ODIHR missions. The latest election observation mission was conducted in 2021 to observe the local elections. The international observers found that the local elections were generally well administered but were held against the backdrop of a protracted political crisis and characterised by hardened polarisation. They were also marred by widespread and consistent allegations of intimidation, vote-buying, pressure on candidates and voters, and an uneven playing field. Armenia Armenia’s relations with the EU are based on the Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement (CEPA), which was signed in November 2017 and fully entered into force on 1 March 2021. The CEPA, which replaced the previous Partnership and Cooperation Agreement of 1999, deepens bilateral relations in a range of areas, while ensuring compatibility with Armenia’s membership of the Eurasian Economic Union. Accounting for about 16% of Armenia’s total trade (2022), the EU-27 is the country’s second-biggest trading partner after Russia. Reflecting the dynamic development of EU-Armenia relations and the mutual interest in deepening relations based on common values, both sides agreed in February 2024 to launch work on a new EU-Armenia Partnership Agenda for more ambitious cooperation across all areas. The political situation in Armenia changed radically in May 2018, when peaceful street protests brought the opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan to power (the ‘Velvet Revolution’) and the new government embarked on an ambitious reform agenda, including in the areas of the rule of law, transparency and the fight against corruption. The early parliamentary elections of June 2021 reconfirmed this course, with the ruling Civil Contract party garnering 54% of the vote, despite the domestic political backlash and significant humanitarian challenges stemming from the country’s defeat in the second Nagorno-Karabakh war in 2020. The six-week war, triggered by Azerbaijan, was the greatest eruption of violence in the protracted conflict since the 1994 ceasefire. Ending with a Russia-mediated ceasefire on 9 November 2020, it saw Armenians lose control over a part of Nagorno-Karabakh – a formerly autonomous entity within Soviet Azerbaijan, with an ethnic Armenian population and an unrecognised de facto state since the dissolution of the Soviet Union – and the adjacent Azerbaijani districts that they had occupied for 26 years. Tensions reached a new peak following Azerbaijani attacks on targets within the Republic of Armenia’s territory (i.e. not Nagorno-Karabakh) in September 2022. On 19 September 2023, after blockading Nagorno-Karabakh for nine months, leading to a dire humanitarian situation, Azerbaijan launched a military offensive against the region, leaving hundreds of dead and resulting in the defeat of the de facto state and its eventual dismantling. The entire local population of over 100 000 Karabakh Armenians fled to Armenia within a few days. The EU has been steadily increasing its engagement with Armenia and has stepped up assistance to help the country deal, in particular, with the numerous conflict-related challenges, including the refugee situation. EU support to Armenia is mainly provided under the ‘Global Europe’ instrument, with about EUR 180 million allocated for the 2021-2024 period. This has a particular focus on building resilience, as well as on continued support to aid the country’s reforms in order to strengthen democracy and the rule of law. Part of this funding contributes to the EU’s Economic and Investment Plan for Armenia, which includes a package of grants, loans and guarantees with the potential to mobilise some EUR 2.6 billion in public and private investments. Reaffirming its unwavering support for Armenia’s sovereignty, democracy, territorial integrity and socio-economic resilience, the EU has pledged to put forward a resilience and growth plan for Armenia worth EUR 270 million for the period 2024-2027. Through mediation by the President of the European Council, the EU has been actively involved in efforts to reach a negotiated solution to the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, stressing that it needs to be based on the principles of the mutual recognition of territorial integrity and the inviolability of internationally recognised borders based on the 1991 Almaty Declaration. It also underlines the need for Azerbaijan to ensure that the rights and security of the Karabakh Armenians are protected, in order to enable their voluntary and safe return. Since February 2023, based on Armenia’s invitation, EU civilian observers have been deployed along the border with Azerbaijan as part of the EU Mission in Armenia, which has proven to be crucial for security on the ground. A. The European Parliament’s position and interparliamentary cooperation The European Parliament has stood firmly on the side of Armenian democracy and a peaceful resolution to the long-standing conflict with Azerbaijan. In March 2023, Parliament adopted a comprehensive resolution on EU-Armenia relations, sending a strong message of support for the democratic reforms in the country, the deepening of bilateral relations and increased EU engagement in security, in particular through the EU Mission in Armenia and mediation efforts. In October 2023, Parliament ‘condemned in the strongest terms the pre-planned and unjustified military attack by Azerbaijan’ against the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh and called for a substantial increase in EU assistance to Armenia in response to the influx of refugees, Azerbaijan’s threats and Russia’s destabilisation attempts. It also demanded a resolute EU response to Azerbaijan’s actions, including targeted sanctions and a comprehensive review of relations. In March 2024, Parliament strongly welcomed Armenia’s interest in closer ties with the EU, noting that ‘should Armenia be interested in applying for candidate status and continuing on its path of sustained reforms consolidating its democracy, this could set the stage for a transformative phase in EU-Armenia relations’. In earlier resolutions, in January 2023, Parliament strongly condemned the ‘military aggression by Azerbaijan’ of September 2022, as well as ‘Azerbaijan’s illegal blockade of the Lachin corridor’, deploring its humanitarian consequences. In a March 2022 resolution, Parliament ‘strongly condemned Azerbaijan’s continued policy of erasing and denying the Armenian cultural heritage in and around Nagorno-Karabakh’. In May 2021, Parliament adopted a resolution calling, in particular, for the immediate and unconditional release of all Armenian prisoners of war and other captives still detained by Azerbaijan. Following the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, Parliament passed a resolution in January 2021 in which it expressed its regret that ‘changes to the status quo were made through military force’ and stressed that ‘a lasting settlement still remains to be found’. It also reiterated that negotiations for a lasting solution should be based on the principles of the non-use of force, territorial integrity and the equal rights and self-determination of peoples, which underpin the OSCE Minsk Group basic principles. In 2015, the European Parliament passed a resolution on the centenary of the Armenian genocide. Bilateral inter-parliamentary relations are developed in the context of the Parliamentary Partnership Committee, which held its latest meeting in March 2023. Leading MEPs following the situation in Armenia have released a series of statements, insisting, in particular, on the need for a negotiated comprehensive settlement of the conflict and raising concerns over issues such as Azerbaijan’s blockade and military takeover of Nagorno-Karabakh, border incidents and attacks, Armenian captives, landmines, inflammatory rhetoric, humanitarian access and the protection of cultural heritage. B. Election observation Armenia has hosted Members of the European Parliament – as part of OSCE ODIHR election observation missions – on a number of occasions, including the country’s snap parliamentary elections in 2018. The 2018 elections were judged positively, as being well organised and with minimal irregularities, and the European Parliament delegation observed a major drop in electoral malpractice. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the European Parliament was not able to observe the June 2021 elections, but MEPs noted the generally positive assessment by the OSCE ODIHR. Azerbaijan The EU and Azerbaijan have had a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement since 1999. Negotiations for an enhanced agreement were launched in February 2017, but have so far been inconclusive. The EU is Azerbaijan’s key trade partner, representing about 52% of the country’s total trade (2022), mainly due to oil and gas exports to the EU (accounting for about 4.1% and 3.7% of the EU’s oil and gas imports in 2022 respectively by net mass). Azerbaijan’s natural gas exports to the EU started in December 2020, following the completion of the Southern Gas Corridor project. In July 2022, the EU and Azerbaijan declared the intention to double the capacity of the Southern Gas Corridor by 2027. Azerbaijan ranked 134th out of 167 countries in the Economist Intelligence Unit’s 2022 Democracy Index and was classified as ‘not free’ in the 2023 ‘Freedom in the World’ report. President Ilham Aliyev, currently serving his fifth term, succeeded his father, Heydar Aliyev, in 2003. In 2017, he appointed his wife, Mehriban Aliyeva, to the newly created post of First Vice-President. According to the latest EU Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World published in July 2023, ‘the state of play regarding safeguarding of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the respect of the rule of law in Azerbaijan continues to be of concern’, in particular as regards the lack of independence of the judiciary, the restrictions on basic freedoms, including the freedom of expression, assembly and association, as well as intimidation, arrests, detentions and court cases against human rights defenders, civic activists, journalists and political opposition activists. A new law on political parties has further limited political pluralism. Azerbaijan’s victory in the six-week Nagorno-Karabakh war with Armenia, which it launched in September 2020, has further strengthened the position of President Aliyev. As a result of the ceasefire of 9 November 2020, Azerbaijan regained control of the districts adjacent to Nagorno-Karabakh that had been occupied by Armenian forces for over 26 years, opening the possibility for a future return of hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons. It also took control of part of Nagorno-Karabakh itself, a formerly autonomous region that is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but inhabited by ethnic Armenians. In September 2023, after blockading the residual Nagorno-Karabakh for nine months, which led to a dire humanitarian situation, Azerbaijan launched a military offensive against the region, resulting in the defeat of the Armenians’ de facto state and its eventual dismantling. The entire local population of over 100 000 Karabakh Armenians fled to Armenia within a few days. In September 2022, Azerbaijan had launched attacks on the territory of Armenia proper in a dangerous escalation, raising fears of further advances beyond Nagorno-Karabakh. The EU has been actively involved in efforts to reach a negotiated solution to the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, in particular through mediation by the President of the European Council. It underlines the need to ensure mutual respect of sovereignty and territorial integrity, to proceed with the delimitation of the inter-state border and to ensure the protection of the rights and security of the Karabakh Armenians in order to enable their voluntary and safe return. European observers have been deployed in Armenia since February 2023 to contribute to regional security. However, Azerbaijan has not agreed to the deployment of EU monitors on its side of the border. A. The European Parliament’s position and interparliamentary cooperation In March 2023, the European Parliament adopted a comprehensive resolution on EU-Azerbaijan relations, in which it expressed ‘deep concern that violations of fundamental human rights in Azerbaijan follow a systemic and widespread pattern and affect citizens’ rights to liberty and security’. It stressed that further cooperation between the EU and Azerbaijan should be conditional on the country’s effective and tangible progress towards respect for international standards and international commitments and that the release of all political prisoners is an indispensable condition for a new partnership agreement. At the same time, Parliament welcomed Azerbaijan’s humanitarian aid to Ukraine and recognised the role played by Azerbaijan as a provider of fossil fuel energy to the EU. The resolution also strongly condemned Azerbaijan’s September 2022 aggression against Armenia and the blockade of the Lachin corridor, calling on Azerbaijan, in particular, to respect the ruling of the International Court of Justice regarding the blockade and to allow the presence of EU observers deployed in Armenia on the Azerbaijani side of their border. In October 2023, Parliament ‘condemned in the strongest terms the pre-planned and unjustified military attack by Azerbaijan’ against the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh and demanded a resolute EU response to Azerbaijan’s actions, including targeted sanctions, the suspension of negotiations on an enhanced EU-Azerbaijan partnership agreement, the suspension of the Memorandum of Understanding on energy and a comprehensive review of relations. In earlier resolutions, in January 2023, Parliament already strongly condemned the ‘military aggression by Azerbaijan’ of September 2022, as well as ‘Azerbaijan’s illegal blockade of the Lachin corridor’, deploring its humanitarian consequences. In a March 2022 resolution, Parliament ‘strongly condemned Azerbaijan’s continued policy of erasing and denying the Armenian cultural heritage in and around Nagorno-Karabakh’. In May 2021, Parliament adopted a resolution calling, in particular, for the immediate and unconditional release of all Armenian prisoners of war and other captives still detained by Azerbaijan. In a September 2023 resolution, the European Parliament raised the case of political prisoner Dr Gubad Ibadoghlu and urged the Azerbaijani authorities to ‘release all political prisoners, independent journalists and human rights defenders, drop all politically motivated charges against them and stop extraterritorial repression’. In 2019, Parliament passed a resolution calling for the immediate release of Mehman Huseynov, an anti-corruption blogger, and other political prisoners. In 2017, following the ‘Azerbaijani Laundromat’ revelations, it denounced ‘attempts by Azerbaijan and other autocratic regimes in third countries to influence European decision-makers through illicit means’. Official inter-parliamentary relations were resumed in 2016 after a four-year break and the last Parliamentary Cooperation Committee meeting took place in December 2021. Leading MEPs following the situation in Azerbaijan have released a series of statements, in particular insisting on the need for a negotiated comprehensive settlement of the conflict and raising concerns over issues such as the blockade and military takeover of Nagorno-Karabakh, border incidents and attacks, Armenian captives, landmines, inflammatory rhetoric, humanitarian access and the protection of cultural heritage. B. Election observation Azerbaijan has hosted Members of the European Parliament as part of OSCE ODIHR electoral missions. However, in view of the fact that all the country’s elections observed by those missions were deemed to fall short of international requirements, and recommendations still have to be implemented, Parliament decided not to send observers to the 2015 parliamentary elections or the 2018 presidential elections, and it was not invited to observe the 2020 parliamentary elections or the 2024 presidential elections. The ODIHR mission to the 2024 presidential elections stated that the elections ‘took place in a restrictive environment’ and were ‘marked by the stifling of critical voices and the absence of political alternatives’, and that there was a ‘shrinking space for independent media, civil society, and political parties’. It noted that ‘longstanding severe limitations on fundamental freedoms of association, expression and peaceful assembly both in law and in practice run contrary to standards for genuine democratic elections’.

The capital is Kyiv, located on the Dnieper River in north-central Ukraine. A fully independent Ukraine emerged only late in the 20th century, after long periods of successive domination by Poland-Lithuania, Russia, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.). Ukraine had experienced a brief period of independence in 1918–20, but portions of western Ukraine were ruled by Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia in the period between the two World Wars, and Ukraine thereafter became part of the Soviet Union as the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (S.S.R.). When the Soviet Union began to unravel in 1990–91, the legislature of the Ukrainian S.S.R. declared sovereignty (July 16, 1990) and then outright independence (August 24, 1991), a move that was confirmed by popular approval in a plebiscite (December 1, 1991). With the dissolution of the U.S.S.R. in December 1991, Ukraine gained full independence. The country changed its official name to Ukraine, and it helped to found the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), an association of countries that were formerly republics of the Soviet Union. - Head Of Government: - Prime Minister: Denys Shmyhal - Capital: - Kyiv (Kiev) - Population: - (2024 est.) 42,787,000 - Head Of State: - President: Volodymyr Zelensky - Form Of Government: - unitary multiparty republic with a single legislative house (Verkhovna Rada1 [450]) - Official Language: - Ukrainian - Official Religion: - none - Official Name: - Ukrayina (Ukraine) - Total Area (Sq Km): - 603,549 - Total Area (Sq Mi): - 233,030 - Monetary Unit: - hryvnya (UAH) - Population Rank: - (2023) 36 - Population Projection 2030: - 42,628,000 - Density: Persons Per Sq Mi: - (2024) 183.6 - Density: Persons Per Sq Km: - (2024) 70.9 - Urban-Rural Population: - Urban: (2022) 69.7% - Rural: (2022) 30.3% - Life Expectancy At Birth: - Male: (2021) 66.3 years - Female: (2021) 75.3 years - Literacy: Percentage Of Population Age 15 And Over Literate: - Male: not available - Female: not available - Gni (U.S.$ ’000,000): - (2023) 174,919 Land Ukraine is bordered by Belarus to the north, Russia to the east, the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea to the south, Moldova and Romania to the southwest, and Hungary, Slovakia, and Poland to the west. In the far southeast, Ukraine is separated from Russia by the Kerch Strait, which connects the Sea of Azov to the Black Sea. Relief Ukraine occupies the southwestern portion of the Russian Plain (East European Plain). The country consists almost entirely of level plains at an average elevation of 574 feet (175 metres) above sea level. Mountainous areas such as the Ukrainian Carpathians and Crimean Mountains occur only on the country’s borders and account for barely 5 percent of its area. The Ukrainian landscape nevertheless has some diversity: its plains are broken by highlands—running in a continuous belt from northwest to southeast—as well as by lowlands. The rolling plain of the Dnieper Upland, which lies between the middle reaches of the Dnieper (Dnipro) and Southern Buh (Pivdennyy Buh, or the Boh) rivers in west-central Ukraine, is the largest highland area; it is dissected by many river valleys, ravines, and gorges, some more than 1,000 feet (300 metres) deep. On the west the Dnieper Upland is abutted by the rugged Volyn-Podilsk Upland, which rises to 1,545 feet (471 metres) at its highest point, Mount Kamula. West of the Volyn-Podilsk Upland, in extreme western Ukraine, the parallel ranges of the Carpathian Mountains—one of the most picturesque areas in the country—extend for more than 150 miles (240 km). The mountains range in height from about 2,000 feet (600 metres) to about 6,500 feet (2,000 metres), rising to 6,762 feet (2,061 metres) at Mount Hoverla, the highest point in the country. The northeastern and southeastern portions of Ukraine are occupied by low uplands rarely reaching an elevation of 1,000 feet (300 metres). Among the country’s lowlands are the Pripet Marshes (Polissya), which lie in the northern part of Ukraine and are crossed by numerous river valleys. In east-central Ukraine is the Dnieper Lowland, which is flat in the west and gently rolling in the east. To the south, another lowland extends along the shores of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov; its level surface, broken only by low rises and shallow depressions, slopes gradually toward the Black Sea. The shores of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov are characterized by narrow, sandy spits of land that jut out into the water; one of these, the Arabat Spit, is about 70 miles (113 km) long but averages less than 5 miles (8 km) in width. The southern lowland continues in the Crimean Peninsula as the North Crimean Lowland. The peninsula—a large protrusion into the Black Sea—is connected to the mainland by the Perekop Isthmus. The Crimean Mountains form the southern coast of the peninsula. Mount Roman-Kosh, at 5,069 feet (1,545 metres), is the mountains’ highest point. Drainage Almost all the major rivers in Ukraine flow northwest to southeast through the plains to empty into the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. The Dnieper River, with its hydroelectric dams, huge reservoirs, and many tributaries, dominates the entire central part of Ukraine. Of the total course of the Dnieper, 609 miles (980 km) are in Ukraine, making it by far the longest river in the country, of which it drains more than half. Like the Dnieper, the Southern Buh, with its major tributary, the Inhul, flows into the Black Sea. To the west and southwest, partly draining Ukrainian territory, the Dniester (Dnistro) also flows into the Black Sea; among its numerous tributaries, the largest in Ukraine are the Stryy and the Zbruch. The middle course of the Donets River, a tributary of the Don, flows through southeastern Ukraine and is an important source of water for the Donets Basin (Donbas). The Danube River flows along the southwestern frontier of Ukraine. Marshland, covering almost 3 percent of Ukraine, is found primarily in the northern river valleys and in the lower reaches of the Dnieper, Danube, and other rivers. The rivers are most important as a water supply, and for this purpose a series of canals has been built, such as the Donets–Donets Basin, the Dnieper–Kryvyy Rih, and the North Crimea. Several of the larger rivers are navigable, including the Dnieper, Danube, Dniester, Pripet (Pryp’yat), Donets, and Southern Buh (in its lower course). Dams and hydroelectric plants are situated on all the larger rivers. Ukraine has a few natural lakes, all of them small and most of them scattered over the river floodplains. One of the largest is Lake Svityaz, 11 square miles (28 square km) in area, in the northwest. Small saltwater lakes occur in the Black Sea Lowland and in Crimea. Larger saline lakes occur along the coast. Known as limans, these bodies of water form at the mouths of rivers or ephemeral streams and are blocked off by sandbars from the sea. Some artificial lakes have been formed, the largest of which are reservoirs at hydroelectric dams—e.g., the reservoir on the Dnieper upstream from Kremenchuk. The Kakhovka, Dnieper, Dniprodzerzhynsk, Kaniv, and Kyiv reservoirs make up the rest of the Dnieper cascade. Smaller reservoirs are located on the Dniester and Southern Buh rivers and on tributaries of the Donets River. Small reservoirs for water supply also are found near Kryvyy Rih, Kharkiv, and other industrial cities. Three large artesian basins—the Volyn-Podilsk, the Dnieper, and the Black Sea—are exceptionally important for municipal needs and agriculture as well. Soils of Ukraine From northwest to southeast the soils of Ukraine may be divided into three major aggregations: a zone of sandy podzolized soils; a central belt consisting of the black, extremely fertile Ukrainian chernozems; and a zone of chestnut and salinized soils. The podzolized soils occupy about one-fifth of the country’s area, mostly in the north and northwest. These soils were formed by the extension of postglacial forests into regions of grassy steppe; most such soils may be farmed, although they require the addition of nutrients to obtain good harvests. The chernozems of central Ukraine, among the most fertile soils in the world, occupy about two-thirds of the country’s area. These soils may be divided into three broad groups: in the north a belt of the so-called deep chernozems, about 5 feet (1.5 metres) thick and rich in humus; south and east of the former, a zone of prairie, or ordinary, chernozems, which are equally rich in humus but only about 3 feet (1 metre) thick; and the southernmost belt, which is even thinner and has still less humus. Interspersed in various uplands and along the northern and western perimeters of the deep chernozems are mixtures of gray forest soils and podzolized black-earth soils, which together occupy much of Ukraine’s remaining area. All these soils are very fertile when sufficient water is available. However, their intensive cultivation, especially on steep slopes, has led to widespread soil erosion and gullying. The smallest proportion of the soil cover consists of the chestnut soils of the southern and eastern regions. They become increasingly salinized to the south as they approach the Black Sea. Climate Ukraine lies in a temperate climatic zone influenced by moderately warm, humid air from the Atlantic Ocean. Winters in the west are considerably milder than those in the east. In summer, on the other hand, the east often experiences higher temperatures than the west. Average annual temperatures range from about 42–45 °F (5.5–7 °C) in the north to about 52–55 °F (11–13 °C) in the south. The average temperature in January, the coldest month, is about 26 °F (−3 °C) in the southwest and about 18 °F (−8 °C) in the northeast. The average in July, the hottest month, is about 73 °F (23 °C) in the southeast and about 64 °F (18 °C) in the northwest. Precipitation is uneven, with two to three times as much falling in the warmer seasons as in the cold. Maximum precipitation generally occurs in June and July, while the minimum falls in February. Snow falls mainly in late November and early December; accumulation varies in depth from a few inches in the steppe region (in the south) to several feet in the Carpathians. Western Ukraine, notably the Carpathian Mountains area, receives the highest annual precipitation—more than 47 inches (1,200 mm). The lowlands along the Black Sea and in Crimea, by contrast, receive less than 16 inches (400 mm) annually. The remaining areas of Ukraine receive 16 to 24 inches (400 to 600 mm) of precipitation.

Videos and Online Profiles Link Suspects to Moscow Attack Clothing and other details appear to show a connection between four suspects detained by Russia and the men who carried out the concert hall massacre of more than 130 people. Want to stay updated on what’s happening in Russia and Tajikistan? , and we’ll send our latest coverage to your inbox. When four men were detained by the Russian authorities in connection with the massacre at a concert hall outside Moscow last week, they were dressed in the same attire as the assailants seen in videos of the attack, according to a New York Times analysis of footage from the hall, social media profiles and images leaked or released by Russia. The identical clothing and other corresponding details suggest they carried out the attack. A video of one of the suspects being detained, for instance, shows him wearing a light brown T-shirt with a distinctive logo on the left breast and pants with a Boss label: Those details match the clothes worn by a gunman in propaganda footage of the attack released by the Islamic State, a.k.a. ISIS. In addition, the Times analysis shows, the car that the suspects were driving when they were apprehended is the same color and type as one seen in footage from outside the concert hall during the attack. The four suspects in the assault that left more than 130 dead were identified in a Moscow court hearing on Sunday night as Saidakrami M. Rachabalizoda, Shamsidin Fariduni, Muhammadsobir Z. Fayzov and Dalerjon B. Mirzoyev. They were charged with committing a terrorist act and remanded to custody until May 22. Three of the suspects told the court they were from Tajikistan, and in interrogation videos reviewed by The Times, at least two men spoke Tajik. The videos show some of the men being beaten during their detention, and two of the men had clear injuries when they appeared in court. The fourth suspect appeared in court in a wheelchair with apparently limited ability to respond; a leaked copy of his passport suggests he is also a citizen of Tajikistan.

https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/childrens-hospital-in-kyiv-hit-by-ukrainian-air-defence-missile/,https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2024/07/09/russian-missile-identified-in-kyiv-childrens-hospital-attack/,2024-07-09,"Russian Missile Identified in Kyiv Children’s Hospital Attack An analysis of open source evidence, as well as missile experts, have pointed to a Russian launched Kh-101 cruise missile being the weapon that struck a children’s hospital in Kyiv, debunking claims from pro-Russian accounts and actors that denied responsibility and sought to shift the blame for the incident on to Ukraine. The July 8 attack on the Okhmatdyt Children’s Hospital killed two and injured over 50 others, according to the hospital. However, the full toll of dead and injured remains unknown with individuals reported to still be trapped under rubble. In the aftermath of the strike, several social media accounts known for spreading disinformation — including that of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs — began to claim that the missile was American-made and that it had been launched from a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile system. Yet an analysis conducted by Bellingcat using social media footage as well as a 3D model of the missile, all point to the munition being a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile. The analysis is in line with the view of experts, including Fabian Hoffman, a doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo who specialises in missile technology. Dr. Jeffrey Lewis, a nuclear weapons and missile expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California, similarly concluded in an email to Bellingcat that a Kh-101 missile could be seen in footage of the attack posted to social media sites. Bellingcat also tested an alternative theory floated online that the missile was a US-made AIM-120, but found no evidence for this. The hospital attack came as part of a wider Russian missile barrage that hit civilian targets elsewhere in Ukraine, including the city of Dnipro. According to the Ukrainian Air Force, the attack began at approximately 10:00 AM local time and involved at least 36 missiles, including 13 Kh-101 cruise missiles. Analysing the Missile Strike Footage Shortly before noon, reports began to surface claiming that there had been an explosion at the Okhmatdyt Children’s Hospital. These reports were followed by video footage posted to Telegram showing a missile impacting the hospital. The video clearly captured the missile that impacted the hospital. The following frames of the missile were taken from the video above. The missile exhibits several characteristics, including the presence of what appears to be a jet engine at its rear as well as two short wings near the middle of the missile. These are distinct features of the Kh-101, a cruise missile used exclusively by the Russian armed forces. A comparison of a screenshot of the missile that hit the hospital with a 3D rendering of a Kh-101 missile shows that the two indeed share these features. A video overlay of the two images above also demonstrates the matching the features and proportions of the 3D model of the Kh-101 and the missile that hit the hospital. Missile Remnants After the strike, the SBU released three images claiming to show remnants of the munition that hit the hospital. They stated that preliminary findings indicated it was a Kh-101, which appeared to tally with the aforementioned video footage. The images showed what appeared to be a support spar and engine panel. Manuals and imagery that documented previous Kh-101 strikes detailed similar remnants. For example, the support spar in the image below appeared similar to one found in a 2022 Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces’ identification manual (page 28) which detailed a previous Kh-101 strike. Another image showing a yellow panel with the numbers “2983” appears to match with what the same identification manual describes as the Kh-101’s engine cover (page 28, figure 22). The reference image from the manual has another piece that gives a more complete look at the serial number. Additionally, one of the images released by the SBU shows markings on another remnant of the missile that hit the hospital. These markings include the numbers “840708036”, “~234452”, and “45 • 14” . Similar markings using this same format are also visible on a remnant from a Kh-101 that was descibes as having been shot down over Ukraine on December 29, 2023. Some components were turned into a keychain and put up for sale on a website called AirHubStore: It is important to note, however, that none of the SBU images were geolocatable on their own given they were closed cropped and did not show surroundings with identifiable features. This complicated verifying that these parts had indeed been at the scene. However, images posted later by the Gazeta.UA news website were geolocatable to the hospital and appeared to show the same munition remnants as detailed in the SBU posts. For example the support spar can be seen under the arm of an investigator below. The engine panel, meanwhile, can also be seen and its shape matched to the item that can be seen in the earlier SBU picture. The full Gazeta.ua image can be geolocated just a few metres west of the damaged hospital building (50.450632, 30.481437) thanks to other images and videos from the scene captured by Reuters and the Kyiv Post. For example, this video posted by the Kyiv Post showed another angle from where the Gazeta.ua image was taken. Bellingcat has blurred the face, but the same individual in military fatigues can even be seen in each respective publication’s footage, as well as the same damaged material. Similarly, a Reuters photo from the scene captures the same pattern of damage that can be seen in the Gazeta.ua image that shows the same missile remnants as those posted by the SBU. Debunking US Missile Claims In the aftermath of the explosion, some social media personalities were quick to claim that the missile was not of Russian origin. Jackson Hinkle, a political activist who has appeared on Russian state media, was one of the individuals who made the incorrect claim that the missile was US-made. Hinkle has been banned from several social media platforms for spreading false information. Similarly, War on Fakes — widely regarded as a Russian propaganda and disinformation outlet — claimed in a visual analysis that given the length-to-width ratio of the missile, it could not be a Kh-101, but instead an AIM-120 fired from a Ukrainian NASAMS battery. The AIM-120 is produced by the U.S. defence contractor Raytheon Company. The claim that the missile was an AIM-120 ignores the jet engine prominently hanging from the empennage of the missile that hit the hospital. This highly visible feature is present on the Kh-101, but not on the AIM-120. Furthermore, the wings in the mid-section of the missile that hit the hospital are a mismatch for those on an AIM-120. At the time of writing this article, War on Fakes’ Telegram post had nearly 800k views, and thousands of shares. In a follow-up post, War on Fakes claimed that higher quality stills had been edited to make the jet engine of the Kh-101 more prominent, and that in fact the video had shown an AIM-120. However, the jet engine was still visible in lower quality versions of the video, including the ones used in the analysis in this article. Another Telegram account, ves.rf (ВЕСЪ.РФ), which has more than 56,000 followers, also made a post attempting to exonerate Russia for the attack. The post, which had been viewed more than 440,000 times and which had been widely reposted on X/Twitter, also claimed that the missile that struck the hospital was an AIM-120. Simultaneously, ves.rf also provided cover for the strike by stating that the children’s hospital was directly next to the Ukrainian State Aviation Service. This would seem to undermine its earlier claims it was not a Russian missile that hit the hospital. Nevertheless, Bellingcat created a second 3D model to represent an AIM-120 missile to test this theory. When comparing this model to images of the missile that hit the hospital, factors like the forward fins of the AIM-120 not matching were apparent. Additionally, the nose of the AIM-120 is much sharper than that of the missile in the hospital strike video. Perhaps most noticeable is the absence of any component on the AIM-120 matching the jet engine seen at the rear of the missile in the video. The difference between the features of the AIM-120 and the missile that hit the hospital are also noticeable in this video overlay. The hospital was far from the only target during the Russian attack of July 8. At least twenty people were killed in strikes across Kyiv alone, with city mayor Vitali Klitschko saying that almost 100 had been injured. In total, at least 41 people were killed across the country as Russian missiles fell on several cities aside from Kyiv, including Kryvyi Rih and Dnipro. This latest wave of Russian attacks against Ukraine is among the largest and deadliest in months. Most recently, the Russian armed forces launched hundreds of missiles and drones at cities across Ukraine on December 29 2023 and then on January 2 2024, killing dozens of people and injuring hundreds. Correction: A previous version of this story mistranslated an SBU Telegram post, stating that three had died in the attack when in fact two had died. The article has been updated to reflect this.

The primary aim is to assess how these developments align with the geopolitical and geoeconomic interests of the countries involved in the summit, particularly in relation to energy cooperation, transport routes, and regional stability. The report also explores Berlin’s increasing influence in Central Asia, as well as the implications for global power dynamics in the region. Geoeconomic Priorities Kazakhstan’s prioritisation of the Middle Corridor initiative, which aims to connect Central Asia to Europe via the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T), demonstrates a strategic Astana’s decreasing dependence on trade routes controlled by Russia and China. Germany’s allocation of €10 billion through the Global Gateway program highlights Berlin’s intent to diversify European supply chains and counterbalance Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Positioned as a strategic logistics hub, the corridor empowers countries in Central Asia as pivotal transit points between the East and West. This program also offers the region a means to attract significant foreign investment, enhance infrastructure, and strengthen ties with the European Union. In parallel, Uzbekistan’s call for a formal Energy Dialogue focused on low-carbon economies and green hydrogen development aligns with Europe’s energy transition goals. The proposed cooperation with German firms like Siemens, BASF, and MAN suggests an ambition to modernise industrial sectors and move towards sustainable energy sources. By diversifying away from traditional hydrocarbons, Central Asia would be able to address the economic risks presented by climate policies in Europe, while also enhancing the region’s integration into the European energy market. Kyrgyzstan’s focus on the Kambaratin Hydro Power Plant-1 project and the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway underscores its drive to become a key player in regional energy production and infrastructure. Both projects present significant opportunities to attract investment and bolster the region’s economic stability. The railway, in particular, will play a crucial role in linking China with Europe, competing with existing northern routes through Russia. This strategic position allows Kyrgyzstan to benefit from multiple partnerships while minimising dependency on any single external power. Geopolitical Considerations Central Asia’s geographical positioning has long made it a contested region for global powers. Germany’s increasing engagement presents an opportunity for Central Asian republics to diversify their foreign relations and reduce over-reliance on China and Russia. For Germany, this summit reflects a strategic move to support Brussels’ regional strategy and expand its influence in an area that is critical for Eurasian connectivity and global energy supplies. The agenda also included discussions on security concerns, specifically regarding terrorism, extremism, and cybercrime. As Germany strengthens its security cooperation, Central Asia may gain advantages in countering these threats. Kazakhstan’s vocal support for Kyrgyzstan’s bid for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council shows regional solidarity and a growing desire for a stronger international presence. This suggests a shift towards a more self-confident role for Central Asian nations in global diplomacy, further supported by European partnerships. Berlin’s backing of environmental and water resource management initiatives, particularly the efforts to save the Aral Sea and develop sustainable agriculture, provides an additional layer of engagement. These initiatives not only address pressing ecological challenges but also offer an avenue for soft power projection, tying economic assistance to broader regional stability. Strategic Outlook The summit consolidated Germany’s role as a key economic and security partner for Central Asia. By investing in infrastructure and energy projects, Berlin is effectively positioning itself as a counterweight to both China’s BRI and Russia’s historical dominance in the region. The cooperation with Berlin provides Central Asian states with a valuable mechanism to manoeuvre through the current Eurasian geopolitical dynamics hugely affected by the Ukraine conflict and the following the West-Russia’s confrontation. Therefore, Central Asian nations must effectively balance relations among rival powers, all the while safeguarding economic expansion and regional stability. This deepening cooperation shows that Central Asia is becoming a more assertive player on the international stage, capitalising on its strategic location and resources to negotiate favourable partnerships with global powers. The long-term success of these initiatives, however, will depend on the continued commitment of European actors to the region’s development and the ability of Central Asian governments to manage internal political and economic reforms.

Opposition data is more verifiable than the official figures The lack of transparency has made it extremely difficult to verify the results. But the opposition has so far presented more detailed information and allowed its numbers to be scrutinized, which gives them more credibility Four days after Venezuela’s July 28 election, there are growing suspicions of electoral fraud. The ruling party-controlled National Electoral Council (CNE) declared President Nicolás Maduro the winner on Sunday, giving him 51.2% of the vote, compared to 44.2% for his rival, opposition candidate Edmundo González. In its announcement, it described the results as “irreversible,” bypassing the transparency and integrity procedures required, and without providing any data to facilitate verification of its claims. At the same time, the opposition has claimed a comfortable victory, 67% to 30%, based on more than 24,000 voter tallies of which it claims to have a copy. These tallies have been posted on a website, which has joined other sites that are sharing similar data. Given this discrepancy, what can be concluded? My opinion is clear now: the data provided by the opposition is more in-depth and more verifiable. The Maduro government’s data is poor On Sunday night, the CNE announced the election results with a bulletin containing just six figures: three voting figures — for Maduro, Edmundo González and “others” — and three corresponding percentages. These percentages were made when the CNE said the count was at 80% and indicated an “irreversible” trend. But since then, there has been no further update. Four days have passed, and although it is shocking and goes against established procedures, the government has not offered any further data on the election results. The CNE has not published the tally sheets or the full results. In Venezuela, there is electronic voting. The electronic machines provide every voter a paper receipt that shows which candidate they chose. Voters are supposed to deposit their receipts at ballot boxes before exiting the polls. After polls close, each machine prints a tally sheet showing the candidates’ names and the votes each received. These tally sheets are given to present and parties, and sent electronically to the CNE, which is in charge of calculating the totals. The CNE was supposed to publish the results, broken down by polling center and electronic machine, based on the tallies, but in the middle of the night on Sunday, its website stopped working. It is still not online. The government has also not provided the verification records, which certify that the planned Citizen Verification Audit (which compares a count of the paper receipts to confirm the machine’s printout is correct) was successfully carried out. No subnational results have been offered either. The CNE has not published the results of the vote by municipality or by region. It has only released a handful of total figures from Sunday night. As if that were not enough, the six-figure results offered by the CNE are also suspicious. Why? The voting figures for “Maduro,” “Edmundo,” and “Others” coincide with an exact percentage of votes up to the sixth decimal. It would be extremely rare for such a result to happen by chance: it is difficult for it to happen with one candidate — the odds are one in a thousand —, but for it to happen with two candidates, the odds are one in a million. What’s behind this exactitude? The easiest explanation is to imagine that the number of votes offered by the CNE is a figure calculated from percentages: they started from the total votes (10,058,774), took a round percentage, like Maduro’s 51.2%, and with that, they calculated his votes: 5,150,092.288. Since it is absurd to give results with decimals, they left it at 5,150,092. That is why the percentages would be almost be rounded numbers, but not completely, only to the sixth decimal. It is not impossible to believe that those percentages are the correct ones, and that the CNE calculated the votes from them instead of using the votes actually counted, but it is a strange method, to say the least. The opposition’s data is much more in-depth After spending the morning gathering information, the opposition held a press conference on Monday afternoon and announced that they had obtained 73% of the voting tallies. The results of these paper receipts contradicted the CNE’s figures, and gave them the victory. Since then, the opposition has continued to collect tally sheets and has posted them on various websites. The most recent update, made on Thursday, claims to contain 24,576 tallies, which is 81.8% of the total. Anyone can search for a vote, consult the detailed results and even download a scanned copy. Each record contains a lot of information: all the results of the polling station, a QR code version of them, their identifier, the date and time of closing, a security hash chain, and the name and signature of the members of the polling station, the witnesses and even the operator of the voting machine. The records are an essential element to clarify the result of the election, because they are potentially verifiable. For example, their information can be compared with other paper documents from the day, such as the tallies of the Verification Audit. Unlike the CNE, the website that the opposition has published with the tally sheets offers the results in each parish, municipality and Venezuelan state, allowing users to analyze the figures. I myself have been able to access the tabulated data of 997 of these polling stations. I have used the subset that was processed by an independent civil society group, which prefers not to be named for fear of repression, and validated by a group of academics from the Federal University of Pernambuco and the University of Michigan. Before the elections, they chose 1,500 representative polling stations in the country, with pre-registration. They obtained information from 997 tally sheets at the 1,500 polling stations, and from there, applying a formal and documented methodology, they produced an estimate of the final result: 66% for Edmundo González and 31% for Maduro. A thorough audit of these data takes time, but my first impression is positive — in the past I have handled data from dozens of elections in many countries. For example, in the first graph, I show the votes for Maduro and Edmundo for each polling station. I have calculated their percentages and marked those tally sheets with whole percentages, which are few, as to be expected. In this second graph, I have taken voting data from more than 200 Venezuelan parishes and cross-referenced it with a socioeconomic indicator provided by the Venezuelan National Institute of Statistics. It is just an example, but a plausible pattern appears: according to the data from the voting records, Maduro won more votes in the most disadvantaged regions. The conclusion is simple: the Maduro government has barely provided any data to support its declaration of victory, while the Venezuelan opposition has set up an operation to collect and present thousands of records. It offers more information, is more transparent, has opened itself to evaluation and scrutiny, and in this way, has increased the credibility of its results. The only alternative for Chavismo is to undertake a very rapid exercise in transparency. Or perhaps it is already too late? Suspicions of irregularities are growing with each day the ruling party keeps the country in the dark.

All around are the carcasses of burnt-out pick-ups and vehicles, some still smoldering. On Saturday, July 27, a convoy of the Malian army and its Russian auxiliaries from the Wagner Group was ambushed by pro-independence rebels from the Strategic Framework for the Defense of the People of Azawad (CSP-DPA) near Tin Zaouatine, a town straddling the border between Mali and Algeria. Difficult to estimate precisely, the toll was heavy for Wagner's mercenaries. According to a CSP-DPA military leader, some 50 paramilitaries were killed and two taken prisoner, making Tin Zaouatine the worst defeat for the group since it arrived in Mali in late 2021 at the request of the ruling junta. On Monday, 48 hours after the battle, Andriy Yusov, spokesman for Ukraine's military intelligence service (GUR), made a statement that did not go unnoticed. During a broadcast on a local TV channel, he suggested that his services were collaborating with the rebels operating in northern Mali. According to him, they had ""received useful information, and not just that which allowed them to carry out a successful military operation against Russian war criminals."" ""We certainly won't talk about the details just yet,"" he said. According to one rebel commander, ""exchanges"" are indeed taking place with Ukrainian intelligence services to see how they can cooperate. ""We have links with the Ukrainians, but just as we have with everyone else, the French, Americans and others,"" said a spokesman for the CSP-DPA Mohamed Elmaouloud Ramadane. Since being ousted by the Malian army and Wagner from their historic stronghold of Kidal in northern Mali in November 2023, the rebels have been forced to reorganize to continue their fight against the ruling junta in Bamako. For their part, the Ukrainian authorities, who claim to be at war with Russia in every theater, have made targeting Russian paramilitaries a strategic objective. Therefore, in November 2023, videos made public by the Kyiv Post, Ukraine's leading English-language newspaper, revealed that they had opened a new front in Africa by sending Special Forces commandos to Sudan to counter Russian mercenaries supporting General Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo's Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

Rampant corruption facilitates shifting links among state officials and organized crime groups. Since the regime launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, authorities have intensified restrictions on individual rights and liberties in order to stifle domestic dissent. Freedom of expression online is increasingly under attack as governments shut off internet connectivity, block social media platforms, or restrict access to websites that host political, social, and religious speech. Protecting freedom of expression will require strong legal and regulatory safeguards for digital communications and access to information. The potential consequences of false, misleading, and incendiary content are especially grave during election periods, underscoring the need to protect information integrity. Efforts to address the problem should start well before campaigning begins and continue long after the last vote is cast. Governments worldwide have passed disproportionate surveillance laws and can access a booming commercial market for surveillance tools, giving them the capacity to monitor the private communications of individuals inside and beyond their borders in violation of international human rights standards. Russia | DEMOCRACY-PERCENTAGE Democracy Percentage | 1.19 100 | | DEMOCRACY-SCORE Democracy Score | 1.07 7 | Executive Summary In 2023, the Russian government doubled down on its authoritarian tactics as the Putin regime further curtailed freedom of speech; used violence, threats, and politicized arrests and prosecutions to intimidate its enemies; and intensified propaganda in an effort to maintain the support of citizens. After two years of war in Ukraine, Russian society has become increasingly isolated and resentful, deeply influenced by anti-Western propaganda, belligerent narratives, and patriotic appeals. In this environment, civic expression remains constrained and most Russians avoid any unsanctioned political activities. The Ukraine war remained the predominant issue, despite the authorities’ efforts to portray normality through regular elections and diverting citizens’ attention to non-war-related matters. Ukrainian military incursions into the border regions of Belgorod, Bryansk, and Kursk persisted. These areas have endured shelling, drone assaults, and infiltrations by military units claiming to be Russians fighting on the Ukrainian side. The future of European democracy and security is now inextricably linked to the fate of Ukraine. European Union (EU) and NATO member states must not only invest far more—and more efficiently—in their collective defense, but also provide Ukraine with the assistance it needs to roll back Russian advances and build a durable democracy of its own. In addition to defending the international order from emboldened autocrats, democratic governments must attend to democratic renewal within Europe, particularly among nascent democracies. Military aggression from autocracies in the region has underscored the dangers of exclusion from democracy-based organizations like the EU and NATO, galvanizing the political will of policymakers in aspiring member states and generating further public pressure to undertake long-sought democratic reforms. The Russian government conducts highly aggressive transnational repression activities abroad. Its campaign, which heavily relies on assassination as a tool, targets former insiders and others who are perceived as threats to the regime’s security. The government pairs this campaign with control over key cultural institutions operating abroad, in an effort to exert influence over the Russian diaspora.The Russian campaign accounts for 7 of 26 assassinations or assassination attempts since 2014, as catalogued in Freedom House’s global survey. Like-minded governments and international organizations should work together to highlight the threat of transnational repression and establish international norms for addressing it. This includes agreeing on a common definition of transnational repression, and prohibiting the use of Interpol notices on their own to deny immigration or asylum benefits or conduct arrests. Among other tactics, governments should deploy a robust strategy for targeted sanctions against perpetrators of transnational repression.",CREDIBLE

Sweden’s partnership with NATO was historically based on its policy of military non-alignment, which changed following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. - Cooperation began when Sweden joined the Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme in 1994 and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (a multilateral forum for dialogue that brings together all Allies and partner countries in the Euro-Atlantic area) in 1997. - For many years prior to its accession, Sweden had been one of NATO's most active partners and a valued contributor to the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, the Kosovo Force (KFOR) in Kosovo and NATO Mission Iraq (NMI). - As an as 'Enhanced Opportunity Partner'1 (a partner country that makes particularly significant contributions to NATO operations and other Alliance objectives), Sweden experienced enhanced opportunities for dialogue and cooperation with the Allies. - In light of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022, Sweden (together with Finland) submitted on 18 May 2022 its official letter of application to become a NATO Ally. - On 4 July 2022, following the Madrid Summit of NATO Leaders, Sweden and Finland completed accession talks at NATO Headquarters and the then 30 Allies signed the Accession Protocols for both countries the following day, giving them the status of ‘Invitee’. - Sweden’s Accession Protocol was subsequently ratified by all NATO member countries according to their national procedures. - Sweden became a full member of NATO when the Instrument of Accession was deposited in Washington D.C on 7 March 2024. - Under the Partnership Interoperability Initiative, the current Enhanced Opportunity Partners are: Australia, Georgia, Jordan and Ukraine. The road to accession NATO and Sweden have long shared common values. As one of NATO’s closest partners, Sweden has cooperated extensively with the Alliance for several decades, but the country did not aspire to NATO membership. Sweden’s partnership with NATO has historically been based on its policy of military non-alignment and a firm national political consensus, which NATO has fully respected. Sweden’s stance changed following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the biggest security crisis in Europe since the Second World War. After a thorough democratic process, Sweden (alongside Finland) submitted its official letter of application on 18 May 2022 to become a NATO Ally. On 4 July 2022, following NATO’s Madrid Summit, Allied Leaders completed accession talks, signing Accession Protocols for Sweden and Finland the following day. Following the signature of the Accession Protocols, each country had ‘Invitee’ status, allowing their representatives to participate as observers in Allied meetings. Over the following months, Sweden’s Accession Protocol was ratified in the capitals of each of the 31 other Allies. Subsequently, Sweden acceded to the Washington Treaty (or the North Atlantic Treaty) when the country (represented by the Swedish Prime Minister) deposited its Instrument of Accession with the United States government (represented by the US Secretary of State) in Washington, D.C., making Sweden a full member of the Alliance on 7 March 2024. Key areas of cooperation Sweden's cooperation with NATO as a partner was mutually beneficial and included the following activities, many of which it continues to participate in as an Ally: Building capabilities and interoperability - Sweden participated in the PfP Planning and Review Process (PARP) and the Operational Capabilities Concept (OCC), two frameworks that assist partner countries in planning and evaluating the readiness of its contributions to NATO-led peace-support operations. - Sweden participated in numerous PfP exercises and also in NATO Cyber Coalition exercises. - Sweden is cooperating with several other countries to develop a multinational rapid-reaction force for peace-support operations led by the European Union (EU). - Beginning in 2014, under the Partnership Interoperability Initiative, Sweden participated in the Interoperability Platform, which brings Allies together with selected partners that are active contributors to NATO's operations. - Sweden participates in the Strategic Airlift Capability (SAC) initiative. - Sweden's role in training the forces of NATO partner countries is greatly valued by the Allies. The Swedish Armed Forces International Centre (SWEDINT) provides exercises and training with a focus on humanitarian assistance, rescue services, peace-support operations, civil preparedness and the democratic control of the armed forces. The Nordic Centre for Gender in Military Operations is also located at SWEDINT. - Sweden has close ties with other Nordic countries and participates in Nordic Defence Cooperation (NORDEFCO), a regional defence initiative that promotes collaboration between Nordic armed forces. Support for NATO-led operations and missions - Sweden first contributed to a NATO-led operation in 1995 when it sent a battalion to the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia and Herzegovina. - Sweden has supported the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo (KFOR) since 1999. - Swedish personnel worked alongside Allied forces as part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan from 2003 to the completion of ISAF's mission in 2014. Sweden also supported the follow-on Resolute Support Mission (RSM) to further train, assist and advise the Afghan security forces and institutions until its completion in September 2021. Sweden contributed over USD 13 million to the Afghan National Army Trust Fund. - In April 2011, Sweden contributed to Operation Unified Protector (OUP), NATO's military operation in Libya under UN Security Council Resolutions 1970 and 1973. - Sweden also participates in NATO Mission Iraq (NMI), NATO’s advisory and capacity-building mission in Iraq. - Sweden participated in the enhanced NATO Response Force (NRF) in a supplementary role and subject to national decisions. Additionally, Sweden has signed a memorandum of understanding on Host Nation Support which, subject to a national decision, allows for logistical support to Allied forces located on, or in transit through, its territory during exercises or in a crisis. Wider cooperation - Sweden has engaged with NATO's Resilience Committee and cooperates with Allies on regional assessments, critical infrastructure protection, and providing support in dealing with the consequences of a major accident or disaster in the Euro-Atlantic area. - Sweden has participated in numerous NATO crisis management exercises, and Swedish civil resources have been listed with the Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre (EADRCC), including search-and-rescue teams, medical experts, and protection and decontamination units. Sweden regularly conducts major multifunctional civil-military police exercises (the Viking exercises), which involve many other countries as well as participants from international organisations, non-governmental organisations and agencies. - Under NATO's Science for Peace and Security (SPS) Programme, Swedish scientists are actively contributing to a number of activities pertaining to counter-terrorism, chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) defence and environmental security. Notably, experts from Sweden are involved in a top-down project with the primary objective of building long-term capacity for the evaluation of programmes to counter violent extremism. - Sweden actively supports the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security (WPS), and since 2012 has hosted the Nordic Centre for Gender in Military Operations at the Swedish Armed Forces International Centre, to make sure that gender perspectives continue to be integrated into military operations. - Sweden has supported a number of NATO Trust Fund projects in partner countries, focused on areas such as training and evaluation of military units; medical rehabilitation of injured military personnel; explosive ordnance disposal and countering improvised explosive devices; and professional development of security sector employees.",CREDIBLE

The Alliance fully supports Ukraine’s inherent right to self-defence, and its right to choose its own security arrangements. Ukraine’s future is in NATO. Relations between NATO and Ukraine date back to the early 1990s and have since developed into one of the most substantial of NATO’s partnerships. Since 2014, in the wake of Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea, cooperation has been intensified in critical areas. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, NATO and Allies have provided unprecedented levels of support. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv during his first official visit as Secretary General on 3 October 2024. Evolution of NATO-Ukraine relations - Dialogue and cooperation started when newly independent Ukraine joined the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (1991) and the Partnership for Peace programme (1994). - Relations were strengthened with the signing of the 1997 Charter on a Distinctive Partnership, and further enhanced in 2009 with the Declaration to Complement the Charter, which reaffirmed the decision by NATO Leaders at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Ukraine will become a member of NATO. - The 1997 Charter established the NATO-Ukraine Commission as the main body responsible for developing the NATO-Ukraine relationship and for directing cooperative activities. In 2023, the Commission was replaced by the NATO-Ukraine Council, where Allies and Ukraine sit as equals. This change demonstrates the strengthening of political ties and Ukraine’s increasing integration with NATO. - Cooperation has deepened over time and is mutually beneficial. Ukraine has a long track record of active contributions to NATO-led operations and missions. Political and practical support to Ukraine - NATO condemns Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine in the strongest possible terms. This aggression gravely undermines Euro-Atlantic and global security, and is a blatant violation of international law. NATO Allies, in concert with relevant resolutions of the UN General Assembly, demand that Russia stop the war immediately, cease its use of force against Ukraine, and completely and unconditionally withdraw all its forces from Ukraine. - The Allies do not and will never recognise Russia's illegal and illegitimate annexations, including of Crimea. Since Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and the beginning of its aggression in eastern Ukraine in 2014, NATO has reinforced its support for capability development and capacity-building in Ukraine, alongside Allied training of tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops. - Since the NATO Summit in Warsaw in July 2016, NATO's practical support for Ukraine is set out in the Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP) for Ukraine. At the 2022 Madrid Summit, Allies strengthened the CAP to provide even more support to Ukraine. At the 2023 Vilnius Summit, Allies agreed to further develop the CAP into a multi-year programme of assistance, to help rebuild the Ukrainian security and defence sector and transition Ukraine towards full interoperability with NATO. - At the 2024 Washington Summit, Allies agreed to establish NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) to coordinate the provision of military equipment and training for Ukraine by Allies and partners. They also announced a Pledge of Long-Term Security Assistance for Ukraine, providing a minimum baseline funding of EUR 40 billion within the next year, and sustainable levels of security assistance in the future. - NATO stands in unwavering solidarity with the government and people of Ukraine in the heroic defence of their nation, their land and our shared values. The Alliance fully supports Ukraine’s inherent right to self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. Ukraine’s membership aspirations - In response to Ukraine’s aspirations for NATO membership, Allies agreed at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Ukraine will become a member of NATO. They also agreed that Ukraine’s next step on its way to membership was the Membership Action Plan (MAP), NATO’s programme of political, economic, defence, resource, security and legal reforms for aspirant countries. In 2009, the Annual National Programme was introduced as Ukraine’s key instrument to advance its Euro-Atlantic integration and related reforms. - From 2010 to 2014, Ukraine pursued a non-alignment policy, which it terminated in response to Russia’s aggression. In June 2017, the Ukrainian Parliament adopted legislation reinstating membership in NATO as a strategic foreign and security policy objective. In 2019, a corresponding amendment to Ukraine's Constitution entered into force. - In September 2020, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy approved Ukraine's new National Security Strategy, which provides for the development of the distinctive partnership with NATO with the aim of membership in NATO. In September 2022, following Russia’s illegal attempted annexations of Ukrainian territory, Ukraine reiterated its request for NATO membership. - At the 2024 Washington Summit, building on decisions taken at the 2022 Madrid Summit and 2023 Vilnius Summit, Allies reaffirmed that Ukraine’s future is in NATO and that they will continue to support it on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership. To that end, Allies will continue to support Ukraine’s progress on interoperability, as well as additional democratic and security sector reforms, which NATO Foreign Ministers will continue to assess through the adapted Annual National Programme. In Washington, Allied Leaders reaffirmed that they will be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the Alliance when Allies agree and conditions are met. - Response to Russia's war against Ukraine - Practical support to Ukraine - The NATO Representation to Ukraine - Evolution of NATO-Ukraine relations - Wider cooperation Response to Russia's war against Ukraine NATO condemns in the strongest possible terms Russia's illegal, unjustifiable and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine, which gravely undermines Euro-Atlantic and global security and stability, and is a blatant violation of international law. NATO Allies, in concert with relevant resolutions of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly, demand that Russia stop the war immediately, cease its use of force against Ukraine, and completely and unconditionally withdraw all its forces from Ukraine. Furthermore, NATO Allies call on Russia to fully respect international humanitarian law, and to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access and assistance to all persons in need. There can be no impunity for Russian war crimes and other atrocities, such as attacks against civilians and the destruction of civilian infrastructure, which deprives millions of Ukrainians of basic human services. All those responsible must be held accountable for violations and abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law, particularly against Ukraine’s civilian population, including the forced deportation of children and conflict-related sexual violence. Russia’s war has also had a profound impact on the environment, nuclear safety, energy and food security, the global economy, and the welfare of billions of people around the world. Allies and Ukraine strongly condemn Russia’s decision to withdraw from the Black Sea grain deal and its deliberate attempts to stop Ukraine’s agricultural exports, on which hundreds of millions of people worldwide depend. Allies are working to revitalise the grain deal and to enable the continued exports of Ukrainian grain by land and sea, including in cooperation with the European Union and the United Nations. Since Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and the beginning of its aggression in eastern Ukraine in 2014, NATO has adopted a firm position in full support of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders, extending to its territorial waters. The Allies strongly condemn and will not recognise Russia's illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea, and denounce its temporary occupation. NATO Allies have equally condemned Russia's continued aggression and destabilising activities in eastern Ukraine and the Black Sea region since 2014. NATO has increased its presence in the Black Sea and stepped up maritime cooperation with Ukraine and Georgia. NATO also condemns Russia's illegal attempt to annex four regions of Ukraine – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – in September 2022, which is the largest attempted land grab in Europe since the Second World War. The sham referenda in these regions were engineered in Moscow and imposed on Ukraine. They have no legitimacy, and NATO will not recognise them. These lands are Ukraine and will always be Ukraine. The overwhelming vote in the United Nations General Assembly condemning Russia's attempted annexations sent a clear and strong message that Russia is isolated and that the world stands with Ukraine, in defence of the rules-based international order. As a result of Russia's illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea, NATO Allies decided in 2014 to suspend all practical civilian and military cooperation with Russia, while leaving political and military channels of communication open. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Allies have imposed severe sanctions on Russia to help starve the Kremlin's war machine of resources. Allies continue to refine these sanctions in order to increase the pressure on Moscow. These efforts will make it harder for Russia to rebuild its tanks, manufacture missiles and finance its war. Since 2014, regular consultations have taken place in the NATO-Ukraine Commission in view of the direct threats faced by Ukraine to its territorial integrity, political independence and security. The Commission met for extraordinary meetings following Russia’s aggression in Crimea and eastern Ukraine in 2014, after Russia's unjustified use of military force against Ukrainian ships near the Kerch Strait in November 2018 and during Russia's threatening military build-up in April 2021. Other extraordinary meetings of the Commission took place at NATO Headquarters in January and February 2022, focused on Russia's military build-up and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Throughout the war, NATO and Ukraine continued to consult on the security situation and Allied support to Ukraine through the Commission. In July 2023, at the Vilnius Summit, the Commission was upgraded into the NATO-Ukraine Council, demonstrating the strengthening of political ties and Ukraine’s increasing integration with NATO. Furthermore, recognising Ukraine’s increased interoperability and substantial progress with reforms, Allies decided at the 2023 Vilnius Summit that Ukraine’s path to full Euro-Atlantic integration has moved beyond the need for the Membership Action Plan – changing Ukraine’s path to NATO from a two-step process to a one-step process. NATO stands in unwavering solidarity with the government and people of Ukraine in the heroic defence of their nation, their land and our shared values. The Alliance fully supports Ukraine’s inherent right to self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter. NATO Allies remain steadfast in their commitment to further stepping up political and practical support to Ukraine as it continues to defend its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders. Practical support to Ukraine In parallel to its political support, NATO has significantly stepped up its practical assistance to Ukraine. Immediately following the illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014, NATO Foreign Ministers agreed on measures to enhance Ukraine's ability to provide for its own security. They also decided to further develop their practical support to Ukraine, based on a significant enhancement of existing cooperation programmes as well as the development of substantial new programmes. The Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP) At the 2016 NATO Summit in Warsaw, the Alliance's measures in support of Ukraine became part of the Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP), which is designed to support Ukraine's ability to provide for its own security and to implement wide-ranging reforms based on NATO standards, Euro-Atlantic principles and best practices. Under the CAP, NATO has helped Ukraine transform its security and defence sector for many years, providing strategic-level advice via the NATO Representation to Ukraine as well as NATO Headquarters, and practical support through a range of capacity-building programmes and initiatives. Through these programmes and tailored advice, NATO has significantly strengthened the capacity and resilience of Ukraine's security and defence sector, as well as its ability to counter hybrid threats. NATO and Allies have also provided extensive support to capability development, including through training and education and the provision of equipment. The Ukraine CAP Trust Fund As part of the CAP, several Trust Funds were launched since 2014, providing resources to support capability development and sustainable capacity-building in key areas. In 2021, NATO consolidated and transitioned all pre-existing Trust Funds supporting Ukraine into a single Ukraine CAP Trust Fund. The Ukraine CAP Trust Fund enables resourcing for Ukraine-related activities within a single dedicated instrument, a flexible and scalable fund to provide Ukraine with short-term non-lethal military assistance (sustainment) as well as long-term capacity-building support. The Ukraine CAP Trust Fund supports areas such as: - Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4), which assists Ukraine in reorganising and modernising its C4 structures and capabilities; - Medical Rehabilitation, which seeks to support Ukraine in enhancing its medical rehabilitation system to ensure that long-term sustainable services are provided to patients, including active and discharged Ukrainian servicemen and women and civilian personnel from the defence and security sector; and a - Professional Development Programme, which helps develop the abilities of civilians working in Ukraine's defence and security institutions. Completed projects have also supported Ukraine in the areas of military career transition; explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) and countering improvised explosive devices (C-IED); the destruction of small arms and light weapons (SALW), conventional ammunition, and anti-personnel landmines; ammunition stockpile safety management; safe radioactive waste disposal and land restoration; cyber defence; and logistics and standardization. Strengthening the Comprehensive Assistance Package At the 2022 NATO Summit in Madrid, Allies agreed to strengthen the CAP and provide even more support to Ukraine. The strengthened CAP includes initiatives to provide Ukraine with immediate, short-term, non-lethal military assistance, as well as structures to boost NATO's long-term support. Allies and partners have committed around EUR 800 million (approximately USD 870 million) to support these initiatives. Non-lethal assistance based on Ukraine’s immediate needs Under the Ukraine CAP Trust Fund, since February 2022, NATO has delivered projects providing support in multiple areas, for example: - combat rations, - fuel materiel (including jet fuel), - clothing (including winter gear and army boots), - medical supplies (including first aid kits, pharmaceuticals and ambulances), - shelters and generators, - chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) detectors and protection, - explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) and demining equipment, - counter-drone equipment, and - communication systems (including enhanced satellite communication). Longer-term support to Ukraine At the 2023 Vilnius Summit, Allies agreed to further develop the CAP into a multi-year programme of assistance for Ukraine, based on sustained and predictable funding. Longer-term support is organised through three principal lines of effort: recovery and reconstruction, institutional transformation, and transition towards NATO interoperability. Specific activities under these lines of effort include: - Ensuring that Ukraine continues to transition towards full interoperability with NATO, including its progress from Soviet-era to NATO standards, training and doctrines as it develops its capabilities, as agreed in jointly developed initial NATO Interoperability Requirements; - Reforming Ukraine’s defence procurement system to bring it in line with NATO best practices and promote greater effectiveness, accountability and transparency; - Establishing the NATO-Ukraine Joint Analysis, Training and Education Centre (JATEC) in Bydgoszcz, Poland to identify and apply lessons learned from Russia’s war against Ukraine and contribute to increasing interoperability; - Launching new joint activities to support Ukraine’s self-defence through the first NATO-Ukraine Innovation Cooperation Roadmap; - Continuing to support Ukraine’s self-defence with urgently needed non-lethal equipment and supplies through the CAP, including contributions from NATO partners; - Rebuilding damaged military infrastructure (including three training sites); - Demining Ukrainian territory and strengthening Ukraine’s own demining capabilities; - Rehabilitating injured personnel from the defence and security forces and reintegrating them back into service or civilian life. This last point involves multiple projects organised under the Human Centric Framework (HCF) programme, a key component of the CAP. The HCF covers areas such as medical and psychological rehabilitation, human resource management within defence forces, veterans’ reintegration, and Women, Peace and Security (WPS) as a cross-cutting issue within the defence and security sector. HCF projects include the creation of a Medical Information System across Ukraine’s military healthcare facilities, medical training for specific therapy methods like eye movement and desensitisation reprocessing (EMDR), the establishment of a Medical Rehabilitation Centre of Excellence, and support for Ukraine’s participation in the Invictus Games. Increase of the NATO civil budget to support Ukraine At the 2022 Madrid Summit, Allied Leaders agreed as part of the NATO 2030 agenda to boost training and capacity-building, and to increase the NATO common funding ceilings year-on-year in real terms. These increases started in 2023, and will provide a predictable source of Allied funding to achieve results in these vital areas. NATO 2030 sets the ambition to substantially strengthen NATO’s ability to deliver training and capacity-building support to partners. Since January 2023, almost EUR 20 million has been dedicated to cooperative security initiatives to further support selected partner countries, including Ukraine. This additional funding source has enabled projects to be developed and implemented in the areas of psychological resilience and rehabilitation, defence planning, institutional development, cyber defence and training. NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) At the 2024 Washington Summit, NATO Allies agreed to establish NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) to coordinate the provision of military equipment and training for Ukraine by NATO member and partner countries, and will provide logistical support. Its aim is to place security assistance to Ukraine on an enduring footing, ensuring enhanced, predictable and coherent support for the long term. NSATU, which will operate in Allied states, will support Ukraine’s self-defence in line with the UN Charter. NSATU will not, under international law, make NATO a party to the conflict. It will support the transformation of Ukraine’s defence and security forces, enabling its further integration with NATO and ensuring that Ukraine is more capable of defending itself now and deterring any further Russian aggression in the future. NSATU will be based in Wiesbaden, Germany, with logistical hubs in other NATO Allies in the eastern part of the Alliance. It will be led by a three-star general reporting to NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) and involve around 700 personnel from NATO member and partner countries. Pledge of Long-Term Security Assistance for Ukraine Since the start of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, Allies have provided unprecedented political, economic, military, financial and humanitarian support, including military assistance amounting to roughly EUR 40 billion annually. Allies have also made their defence industrial capacity available to support Ukraine’s needs. All of this is having a substantial effect, enabling Ukraine to defend effectively and inflict real and severe costs on Russia. At the 2024 Washington Summit, Allied Leaders announced a Pledge of Long-Term Security Assistance for Ukraine for the provision of military equipment, assistance and training to support Ukraine in building a force capable of defeating Russian aggression today and deterring it in the future. Through proportional contributions, Allies intend to provide a minimum baseline funding of EUR 40 billion within the next year, and to provide sustainable levels of security assistance for Ukraine to prevail. Allies will report to NATO on support delivered in relation to this Pledge twice per year, with the first report to include contributions delivered after 1 January 2024. Based on this, the Secretary General will provide an overview of all notified contributions to Allies. Heads of State and Government will re-evaluate Allied contributions at future NATO summits, starting at the 2025 NATO Summit in The Hague. Bilateral security commitments to Ukraine NATO welcomes the bilateral, long-term security commitments that Allies and NATO partners have agreed with Ukraine based on the G7 Joint Declaration of Support for Ukraine launched at the 2023 Vilnius Summit. As of July 2024, more than 20 Allies and partners have signed bilateral security agreements with Ukraine, giving Ukraine enduring security commitments. These agreements are mutually reinforcing and are a testament to the shared and unwavering commitment to a free, independent, democratic and sovereign Ukraine, within its internationally recognised borders, capable of defending itself and deterring future aggression. These commitments, together with the decisions taken at the 2024 Washington Summit, provide for sustained, enduring support to Ukraine as it defends its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and support Ukraine’s Euro-Atlantic integration. The NATO Representation to Ukraine The NATO Representation to Ukraine (NRU) supports cooperation on the ground. As NATO and Ukraine continue to intensify their cooperation and strengthen Ukraine’s political integration with NATO, the Alliance is reinforcing the NRU and expanding its staff levels at the office in Kyiv. Furthermore, the Secretary General has decided to appoint a NATO Senior Representative to head the NRU and to act as a focal point for NATO’s engagement with Ukrainian authorities in Kyiv. The NRU was established in September 2015 to oversee two already existing offices: the NATO Information and Documentation Centre (NIDC) and the NATO Liaison Office (NLO). NATO Information and Documentation Centre (NIDC) The NIDC was inaugurated in Kyiv in 1997 to support efforts to inform the Ukrainian public about NATO's activities and the benefits of NATO-Ukraine cooperation. The NIDC is part of the NATO Public Diplomacy Division and was the first information office established by NATO in a partner country and open to the general public. The Centre has three key pillars of work: - increasing awareness and understanding of NATO in Ukraine; - informing the Ukrainian public about key activities in NATO-Ukraine cooperation; and - providing advice and support to Ukrainian institutions in the area of strategic communications capability development. In order to facilitate NATO's core mission and activities in Ukraine, the NIDC supports various public diplomacy and communications projects, including round tables, seminars, conferences and multimedia projects. NATO Liaison Office (NLO) The NLO was established in Kyiv in 1999 and plays a key role in facilitating NATO-Ukraine cooperation. Its main priorities include: - maintaining contact with Ukrainian ministries and agencies; - advising Ukrainian authorities on activities in support of the NATO-Ukraine partnership and reforms, in particular the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Interior; the National Security and Defence Council; the Security Service of Ukraine; the Parliament; and non-governmental organisations; - enhancing NATO-Ukraine political and practical dialogue; and supporting contacts between NATO and Ukrainian civil and military authorities and advisers. The NATO Representation to Ukraine leads on the provision of strategic-level advice under NATO's Comprehensive Assistance Package for Ukraine. Evolution of NATO-Ukraine relations NATO-Ukraine relations were formally launched in 1991, when the newly independent country joined the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC), a forum for dialogue and cooperation between NATO Allies and their former Warsaw Pact adversaries. A few years later, in 1994, Ukraine joined the Partnership for Peace (PfP), a programme of practical bilateral cooperation between individual partner countries and NATO. It was one of the founding members of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC), which replaced the NACC in May 1997. The July 1997 Charter on a Distinctive Partnership remains the basic foundation underpinning NATO-Ukraine relations. The Charter established the NATO-Ukraine Commission as the main body responsible for advancing NATO-Ukraine relations. The Commission directed cooperative activities and provided a forum for consultation between the Allies and Ukraine on security issues of common concern. The Declaration to Complement the Charter, signed in 2009 as a follow-up to the decisions taken at the 2008 NATO Summit in Bucharest, gave the Commission a central role in deepening political dialogue and cooperation to underpin Ukraine's reform efforts pertaining to its Euro-Atlantic aspirations for membership in NATO. The principal tool to support this process is the Annual National Programme (ANP), which reflects Ukraine's national reform objectives and annual implementation plans. The ANP has been composed of five chapters focusing on: political and economic issues; defence and military issues; resources; security issues; and legal issues. This includes reforms related to good governance, the fight against corruption, the rule of law, human rights, and the security and defence sector, in accordance with Euro-Atlantic principles and standards. Allies assess progress under the ANP annually. The responsibility for its implementation falls primarily on Ukraine. The Commission for Coordination of Euro-Atlantic Integration of Ukraine, chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration, ensures the general coordination of its implementation by the state bodies. In 2023, the NATO-Ukraine Council was established as the successor to the NATO-Ukraine Commission. The change from Commission to Council demonstrates the strengthening of political ties and Ukraine’s increasing integration with NATO. In the Council format, Ukraine sits alongside all NATO member states as an equal participant. The Council can be convened by the Secretary General as well as by its individual participants, including Ukraine, for crisis consultations. The inaugural meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council took place on 12 July 2023 at the Vilnius Summit. Wider cooperation Since 2014, in the wake of Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, NATO-Ukraine cooperation has been intensified in critical areas. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine starting in February 2022, NATO and Allies have provided unprecedented levels of support to Ukraine. But NATO's support to Ukraine and activities in partnership with the country did not begin in 2014 or 2022 – practical cooperation between NATO and Ukraine has been ongoing since the 1990s. Over the years, Ukraine's cooperation with NATO has been mutually beneficial and has covered a wide range of activities – from building Ukraine's capabilities and interoperability with NATO forces, to promoting reforms in Ukraine's defence and related security sector, to supporting non-military activities like collaborative scientific research and public diplomacy. Further to the Ukraine CAP Trust Fund projects described above, NATO's cooperation with Ukraine has been implemented through the following programmes and initiatives: - the NATO-Ukraine Platform on Countering Hybrid Warfare, - the Resilience Advisory Support Team, - the Planning and Review Process, - the NATO Building Integrity (BI) process and the annual BI tailored programme, - the NATO Defence Education Enhancement Programme (DEEP), - the Air Situation Data Exchange Programme, - the Military Committee with Ukraine Work Plan, - the Operational Capabilities Concept Evaluation and Feedback Programme, - the Science for Peace and Security (SPS) Programme, and - many other initiatives organised through the advisory mission of the NATO Representation in Kyiv. Ukraine has also provided support for NATO-led operations and missions, enhancing the interoperability of Ukrainian troops with NATO armed forces. NATO-Ukraine Platform on Countering Hybrid Warfare Against the background of the initial stages of Russia's war against Ukraine – not just the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, but also the use of cyber attacks, disinformation and other hybrid activities over the subsequent years – the NATO-Ukraine Platform on Countering Hybrid Warfare was established at the NATO Summit in Warsaw in July 2016. It provides a mechanism to be better able to identify hybrid threats and to build capacity in identifying vulnerabilities and strengthening resilience of the state and society. Projects in support of research, training and expert consultations are ongoing, with a focus on lessons learned, countering disinformation and enhancing resilience. Resilience Advisory Support Team (RAST) Since Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and destabilisation of eastern Ukraine in 2014, experts have provided advice on Ukraine's contingency plans and crisis management measures to defend critical energy infrastructure and protect the civilian population. Today, cooperation focuses on improving national capacity for civil preparedness and resilience. In 2019, a Resilience Advisory Support Team (RAST) drew up recommendations to Ukrainian institutions with regard to the enhancement of national resilience. At Ukraine's request, follow-up expert-level RAST consultations providing technical advice to support the country's long-term resilience and civil preparedness activities took place in early 2022, prior to Russia's full-scale invasion. Ukraine also participates regularly in activities organised by NATO's Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre and has itself hosted multiple disaster response exercises. Participation in the Planning and Review Process has helped Ukraine set and achieve ambitious yet realistic objectives for defence and security reforms, transformation and capability development; for improving the ability of its forces to operate alongside Allied and partner forces in crisis response and peace-support operations; and for enhancing Ukraine's ability to host Allied and partner forces for exercises and training. Building Integrity (BI) process Since 2007, Ukraine has participated in NATO's Building Integrity (BI) Initiative, which provides practical assistance and advice for strengthening integrity, accountability and transparency in the defence and security sector. In October 2019, nine institutions of Ukraine's defence and security sector completed the NATO BI Self-Assessment and Peer Review Process, which provided a thorough assessment of institutional needs and vulnerabilities and offered a set of policy-level sectoral recommendations to improve good governance and pursue sustainable anti-corruption reforms in the defence and related security sectors. On this basis, a tailored programme of activities continues to provide two levels of capacity-building support – specific expertise to the institutions to enhance the good governance and management of defence resources (financial, human and materiel), and education and training activities to develop individual capacities and foster an organisational culture of integrity. Defence Education Enhancement Programme (DEEP) Since 2013, the Defence Education Enhancement Programme (DEEP) has helped to improve and restructure Ukraine's military education and professional training systems, focusing on eight defence higher education institutions and five training centres for Non-Commissioned Officers. Additionally, DEEP advises on management of the academies and universities, supporting faculty on how to teach and assisting in the development of courses on leadership and decision-making processes. The focus of the DEEP programme for officers is on: curriculum and faculty development; instructor training; English language training; occupational specialties development; lessons learned system development; e-learning systems; and increasing institutional capacities. The focus of the DEEP programme for NCOs is on instructor training, firearms instructor training and combat squad leader training. Air Situation Data Exchange programme Ukraine joined the Air Situation Data Exchange programme in July 2006. It enhances awareness and aviation safety through the mutual sharing of air situation data, which improves the operational effectiveness of air defence through the identification, classification and potential de-confliction of aircraft. This capability has had particular operational relevance and benefit following Russia's further invasion of Ukrainian territory since February 2022. NATO has been working closely with Ukraine to provide the most relevant information possible. Military Committee with Ukraine Work Plan Participation in a wide range of military activities and exercises under the Military Committee with Ukraine Work Plan focuses on improving the interoperability and operational capabilities of Ukraine's armed forces, but also substantially contributes to ongoing security and defence reforms. NATO Operational Capabilities Concept Evaluation and Feedback Programme Ukraine's active participation in the NATO Operational Capabilities Concept Evaluation and Feedback Programme supports the further development of the armed forces, while also enabling the Alliance to put together tailored force packages that can be deployed in support of NATO-led operations and missions. Science for Peace and Security (SPS) Programme Ukraine has been actively engaged in NATO's Science for Peace and Security (SPS) Programme since 1991. A Working Group on Scientific and Environmental Cooperation contributes to identifying priority areas for practical scientific cooperation in the framework of the SPS Programme. Since 2014, in response to the crisis in Ukraine, cooperation in the field of security-related civil science and technology has been strengthened, and Ukraine has since become the largest beneficiary of the SPS Programme. Leading areas of cooperation with Ukraine in the SPS framework include advanced technology, counter-terrorism, defence against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) agents, as well as energy and environmental security. Among these activities, noteworthy is the participation of Ukraine in the DEXTER Programme, which is developing an integrated system to detect explosives and firearms in public spaces. In addition to the programmes listed above, Ukraine has participated in many other initiatives organised through the advisory mission of the NATO Representation in Ukraine. - NATO supports Ukraine in implementing United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security. - A legal framework has been established to enable NATO and Ukraine to further develop operational cooperation, including the Partnership for Peace (PfP) Status of Forces Agreement (entered into force in May 2000); the Host Nation Support Agreement (ratified in March 2004); and the Strategic Airlift Agreement (ratified in October 2006). - In June 2020, Ukraine became an Enhanced Opportunity Partner (EOP). This is a status offered to participants in NATO's Partnership Interoperability Initiative that have made particularly significant contributions to NATO operations and other Alliance objectives. EOP status works as a facilitator, providing Ukraine preferential access to NATO's interoperability toolbox, including exercises, training, exchange of information and situational awareness. The other EOPs are Australia, Georgia and Jordan. - Ukraine has also built capacity and interoperability through participation in the NATO Response Force. Support for NATO-led operations and missions Ukraine has contributed to the peace-support operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It has also contributed to the Kosovo Force (KFOR), including with a heavy engineering unit with counter-improvised explosive devices capabilities. In support of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, Ukraine allowed over-flight clearance and the transit of supplies, and contributed medical personnel to support Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Afghanistan and instructors to the NATO Training Mission in Afghanistan. Following the end of ISAF's mission in 2014, Ukraine supported the follow-on Resolute Support Mission (2015-2021) to train, advise and assist Afghan security forces. From March 2005, Ukraine contributed officers to the NATO Training Mission in Iraq, which terminated in December 2011. Ukraine deployed ships six times between 2007 and 2010 in support of Operation Active Endeavour, a counter-terrorist maritime surveillance operation in the Mediterranean Sea. In 2013, it also contributed to NATO's counter-piracy operation Ocean Shield. Since the launch of maritime operation Sea Guardian in 2016, Ukraine has provided information in support of NATO's maritime situational awareness in and around the Black Sea.",CREDIBLE

With 496 votes for, 70 against and 64 abstentions, the European Parliament adopted a resolution questioning Slovakia’s ability to fight corruption and protect the EU budget should the reform of the criminal code proposed by the new government of Robert Fico be adopted. The resolution concluded the debate of 13 December 2023. Need to protect the rule of law MEPs are particularly concerned about the unjustified use of a fast-track procedure for the criminal code reform and the dissolution of the Special Prosecutor’s Office that handles corruption cases and serious crimes. These changes threaten the integrity of judicial processes and undermine the EU’s fight against fraud according to MEPs. They also call on the Slovak government to reconsider the proposed changes in whistleblower legislation, as the new rules could be used to retroactively strip them of protection. MEPs stress that any criminal law reform must ensure the continuation of ongoing criminal cases and the effectiveness of new ones. Parliament further urges the government to address, and prevent the misuse of, the long-standing issue of Paragraph 363 of the Criminal Procedural Law, which currently allows the General Prosecutor to decline to prosecute. Worries about civil society, media freedom MEPs condemn the inappropriate and disrespectful language used by Prime Minister Fico towards a law student engaged in an academic exchange on the state of rule of law, and urge all political leaders to engage constructively and respectfully with the public. Parliament is very concerned by plans to adopt legislation undermining the civic space, restricting the work of NGOs and stigmatising organisations receiving foreign funding. MEPs are also worried about the planned restructuring of Radio and Television of Slovakia (RTVS) and regret the decision of Prime Minister Fico and several government officials to no longer talk to key media outlets. They demand an end to verbal attacks on individuals and media representatives, which in the past have contributed to an environment in which violent crimes such as the murders of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová were committed. Background On 6 December 2023, the new government of Robert Fico launched a procedure to overhaul the country’s penal code, lowering penalties for serious offences and dissolving the Special Prosecutor’s Office. The government has also been accused of targeted personnel changes in the Slovak police and of investigators. President Zuzana Čaputová has said she would veto the law and the European Public Prosecutor´s Office has warned some changes could pose risks to the effective protection of the European Union´s financial interests and its anti-corruption framework.

Ten years of tragedy for the people of Syria. Displacement, exile, poverty, destruction, torture, enforced disappearances, barrel bombs, chemical weapons. We thought that we would never need to see this again, at our doorstep. Five countries have soldiers in Syria in this moment. But even with the military support of Russia and Iran, Assad cannot win and only a political solution is sustainable. And yet, the political process set out by the United Nations Security Council in resolution 2254 is stuck, completely stuck. A Constitutional Committee has been set up to negotiate a new constitution, providing the basis for free and fair elections, supervised by the United Nations. But the Assad regime blocks any real discussion. It does not want free and fair elections. Instead, in June, Assad will hold his own elections, to make sure he wins, to convey that Syria is at peace; that reconstruction should begin and sanctions be lifted; and that we should recognise that he won. Nothing else would be a bigger mistake. Peace is not won by crushing the people, by crushing the opposition and pursuing a war until the country, the whole country is on its knees. In Syria over 500,000 people have died. The economy is literally collapsing. More than half of the population has fled their homes. In Northern Syria today, hundreds of thousands live in tents. The pandemic has exacerbated the challenges. Latest data suggests the poverty rate stands at 80%. And 12 million Syrians – nearly 60% of the population – are severely hit by food insecurity. Dear Members, all this is happening on our borders, in our immediate neighbourhood on the other side of the Mediterranean. We should not and we cannot, and we will not allow Syria to be forgotten. On the 30th of March, I will co-chair with the United Nations a fifth Brussels conference on the Future of Syria and the region. We must give the United Nations and its Special Envoy Mr [Geir] Pedersen our full support and continue to push for a genuine political solution, according to the United Nations Security Council Resolution. The political process has to move forward. With a new negotiated constitution, free and fair elections, release of political prisoners. The EU is ready to provide its support and – once the time is right – to focus its reconstruction funds on the rebuilding of Syria and of the lives of its citizens. We are ready to provide very substantial support, but business as usual is not an option. We demand a safe Syria for refugees to return to their homes; a real search for the missing – the Commission is calling for the creation of an international mechanism to locate the missing or their remains, some in mass graves; accountability for the many war crimes and crimes against humanity – and an end to impunity. Until we see this, we must keep up the pressure. There will be no end to sanctions, no normalisation, no support for reconstruction, until a political transition will be underway. This must be the message from the Brussels conference. Dear Members, we must keep providing assistance to the Syrian people in need. Both, in Syria and in the neighbouring countries, in particular in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, who host millions of refugees. These people deserve our continued support. In ten years, as European Union and its Member States, we have provided €22 billion, it means in average €2.2 billion every year, in assistance for needs inside Syria, in support of refugees and in support of refugee-hosting countries. We are the biggest donor. And we will continue showing our solidarity. The support of this Parliament to these efforts has been, and remains, crucial. The needs are immense, and we will call on other donors to provide support too, because we cannot do everything. And of course, we will continue engaging with civil society. Their voice is crucial to fully understand what is happening, and what is needed. They bring hope for the future, for a peaceful and different Syria. We cannot let them down. We cannot give up. I thank you for your interest and count on your full support. Link to the video: Closing remarks Thank you President, After listening to all of you, I share what you have been saying, but the important thing is not to repeat once and again the same figures “how many people killed, how many refugees, end of impunity, foreign troops have to leave”. The repetition of wishful thinking does not change reality, come on. Let us try to be realistic. The European Union cannot solve this conflict alone. The United Nations Special Envoy [for Syria, Geir] Pedersen has made clear that a common understanding amongst the Astana guarantors and likeminded Western stakeholders will be required if the conflict has to be solved. We are ready to provide for a forum of this type, but we know that discussions will be very difficult to take place. But without an international understanding there is no solution. And even, an international understanding will not be sufficient on its own. The only solution for the time being is to maintain pressure for a transition in the way Syria is governed. For real change. For the Assad regime to be held accountable, yes, for a decade of brutal war and repression. But this is not going to happen just because you invoke them. We are going to hold the Brussels conference on Syria at the end of this month. It must be the place to revitalise the United Nations process, and it should be successful in raising pledges to meet the dramatic humanitarian needs of the Syrian people. Let us start by this. Let us start by collecting the resources needed to help in practical terms, here and now, the people in need. I will do my best in order to push for this conference to be a success, but I am afraid that once and again the European Union will be the most important actor. The one who brings more resources. There is a certain fatigue in the international community to continue supporting the faith of the Syrian people after 10 years of pledging. I hope that you will participate in making this conference a success. I take this opportunity to thank you for your constant support and for the claim for a need for justice and accountability. But this will not come just by claiming it, we have to put on the table political agreements among the actors. It is the only way out. Assad will not leave because you ask him to do so. We make errors, yes. 10 years of conferences, yes. The important thing is how to get out of this. It has to be step by step, looking for a consensus among the most important actors. If not, we will not be able to solve it. Do not ask the European Union to solve what we cannot solve alone. Let us start by bringing the resources needed to help the people in need and let us work for the United Nations to open the humanitarian access to the people in Idlib or, at least, to continue having open the access that there is still open. Let us engage politically, I repeat it once again, with the actors, which are present in this war in order to get a consensus that can finish this war. But it is not going to happen just by asking for it. Link to the video:",CREDIBLE

This included direct humanitarian aid, emergency civil protection assistance, support at the border, as well as granting protection to those fleeing the war and entering the EU. For the first time in its history, the European Union activated the Temporary Protection Directive setting the legal rules to help manage the mass arrival of people. In parallel, the European Commission quickly began to coordinate with EU countries to gather information about the situation on the ground and to prevent trafficking in human beings. DG HOME coordinates the Solidarity Platform, which brings together EU countries, international partners, and EU agencies to ensure the implementation of the Temporary Protection Directive. The EU Migration Preparedness and Crisis Blueprint collects important information, such as the arrivals of refugees, to properly stir migration management response. Temporary protection Drawing from past experience in managing migration, it soon became clear that EU countries would not have appropriate capacity to process asylum applications lodged by the high number of people fleeing the war. That is why on 2 March 2022, the Commission proposed to activate the Temporary Protection Directive, which was then adopted by the European Council on 4 March 2022 through the Decision to grant those fleeing the war in Ukraine temporary protection. People who are eligible have the right to temporary protection for a period of one year. If war persists, there are possibilities to extend temporary protection for an additional two years. Beneficiaries of temporary protection have the right to: - residency - access to housing - social welfare assistance - medical care - legal guardianship and safe placement for unaccompanied children and teenagers - access to education for children and teenagers - access to the labour market (subject to EU countries’ labour market policies) - access to banking services, for instance opening a basic bank account - move to another EU country, before the issuance of a residence permit - move freely in EU countries (other than the Member State of residence) for 90 days within a 180-day period after a residence permit in the host EU country is issued To explain the provisions of the Temporary Protection Directive and the Council implementing Decision in the context of granting temporary protection to people fleeing the war in Ukraine, on 21 March 2022 the Commission issued Operational guidelines. The guidelines are not a legally binding document but address the practical aspects to help EU countries in implementing the Directive and the Council implementing Decision. The Commission also published a Frequently Asked Questions document on the interpretation of the Temporary Protection Directive and Council Implementing Decision 2022/382. The Commission published a Frequently Asked Questions document on going home to Ukraine on a voluntary basis in the context of the Temporary Protection. Practical information for people fleeing the war and arriving to the EU All the key information for those fleeing the war is centralised on the information webpage. There, people can find practical information in English, Ukrainian and Russian about their rights concerning: - temporary protection - travel within the EU - access to housing, health care, education and jobs People can also find the hotlines and the contact points of national authorities and practical information about the key organisations in the EU helping those fleeing the war. The webpage: Information for people fleeing the war in Ukraine Phone helpline for those fleeing the war in Ukraine The European Commission launched a phone helpline for people displaced from Ukraine. The helpline can be contacted in Ukrainian and Russian within the EU at 00 800 6 7 8 9 10 11, as well as from outside the EU at +32 22 99 96 96. Solidarity Platform The Solidarity Platform has been set up to ensure the provisions of the Temporary Protection Directive in close collaboration with all parties mentioned below. Its role is to monitor the needs identified in EU countries and coordinate an operational response. The Solidarity Platform also provides a general forum for discussion to support the implementation of the 10-Point Plan presented by the Commission after the Extraordinary Justice and Home Affairs Council of 28 March 2022. The Solidarity Platform continues to prove its added value in the overall coordination of the EU response to the Russian aggression against Ukraine, by offering an informal space, usually an online meeting area, for the quick alignment of operational and policy responses by the key stakeholders. The Solidarity Platform, coordinated by DG HOME, brings together: - EU countries - Schengen Associated States - EU Agencies (in particular, EU Agency for Asylum, Frontex and Europol) - IOM, UNHCR and other partners, including civil society organisations in specific meeting formats - Ukrainian authorities - International partners The Platform meets on a regular basis alongside the Council’s Integrated Political Crisis Response (IPCR) as well as the EU Migration Preparedness and Crisis Management Network (the Blueprint). Cooperation with international partners plays a key role. The EU’s partners such as the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom are engaged in the Solidarity Platform meetings dedicated to international cooperation. In addition, the involvement of the Ukrainian authorities in Ukraine, the Ukrainian embassies and consulates in the EU Member States is of great importance. The Solidarity Platform engages regularly with Ukrainian authorities to assess the needs and address potential challenges experienced by Ukrainian citizens in the EU. The European Commission also regularly engages with civil society organisations through the Solidarity Platform but also in bilateral meetings and on the ground through EU staff in respective Member States. Objectives and actions of the Solidarity Platform - Provide a general forum for discussion and action to support the implementation of the 10-Point plan for a stronger coordination and exchange of best practices on welcoming the people fleeing Russia's invasion of Ukraine - Collect relevant information on reception and accommodation capacity in EU countries - Coordinate matching offers from EU countries to accept people fleeing war in Ukraine who have already arrived in the EU - Coordinate the transfer of persons from Moldova to EU countries and Schengen Associated Member States - Facilitate and make use of relevant EU instruments Priorities and agenda items are defined by the Commission in close collaboration with Member States and other stakeholders such as the Ukrainian authorities to ensure discussions based on needs. Given the concrete and operational nature of some issues discussed, several sub-groups of the Solidarity Platform have been established, which are convened on a regular or ad-hoc basis. These include for instance a sub-group on the transfers of displaced persons from Moldova or a sub-group on the Temporary Protection Platform. Since its establishment on 4 March 2022 with a Council Implementing Decision, the Solidarity Platform achieved concrete results in managing migration across several actions delivering on the 10-Point Plan set out below. On 8 March 2023, one year following its activation, a Communication took stock of the implementation of the Temporary Protection Directive in the context of the war in Ukraine and identified priority areas for the future, including through the work of the Solidarity Platform. Overview of the meetings of the Solidarity Platform on Ukraine Delivering on the 10-Point Plan The European Commission established a Temporary Registration Platform on 31 May 2022 in just six weeks since the beginning of Russian aggression to Ukraine. Through this platform, EU countries exchange information on beneficiaries of temporary protection and the national protection status of people who fled the war in Ukraine and found refuge in the EU. The Solidarity Platform has followed an EU-level coordinated approach on the transport and information hubs that countries put in place along displacement routes: - Border crossings - Bus and train stations - Large transit accommodation centres The result of this coordinated action is the network of transportation and information hubs, compiled in a map with locations across the EU's Member States that show reception facilities, transfer hubs or offer further information about how to travel and stay in the EU. The Commission launched an EU-wide communication campaign to inform people fleeing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine about their rights under protection, prevention of human trafficking and to tackle disinformation and misinformation. In addition, the Commission produced a testimonial video with the stories of three Ukrainian women who found a refuge in the EU. More than 3.5 million people have been reached so far. The Commission also made available a dedicated EU helpline in Ukrainian and Russian. Communication and information actions are closely coordinated with EU Member States, the EU Agency for Asylum as well as other stakeholders, including the Ukrainian authorities and civil society organisations. Alongside Member States, hundreds of thousands of Europeans have opened their homes to host displaced people from Ukraine. This has been an unprecedented act of solidarity. The European Commission is supporting EU countries to map reception capacity and accommodation. To ensure sustainable housing options for those fleeing the war, the European Commission has presented an EU Guidance on ‘Safe Homes’. This Guidance includes key principles and practice to respond to the evolving needs in reception capacity. By collecting and reflecting on practices carried out in EU countries, regions, cities, civil society, foundations and by individuals, the Guidance provides examples how to overcome the challenges for those offering private accommodation. - Factsheet: Safe Homes Initiative In order to facilitate access to the EU labour market, the European Commission has launched the EU Talent Pool Pilot, a project that will allow beneficiaries of temporary protection to register and access a job seeking platform with more than 3 million job offers. The EU Talent Pool Pilot is implemented through the EURES platform. In cooperation with national governments, EU agencies and international organisations, the Solidarity Platform focused on increasing overall preparedness at EU level for medium and long-term needs by developing contingency plans in case of increased arrivals from Ukraine and Moldova. Throughout the second half of 2022, the key priority was to prepare and be ready for winter, including preparation of the temporary reception facilities. Child protection has been central to the EU’s support for persons fleeing the Russian aggression against Ukraine. Members of the Solidarity Platform continuously discuss and address specific challenges of reception and care for unaccompanied and separated children from Ukraine. The Commission also issued a Frequently Asked Questions on Registration, Reception and Care for the Unaccompanied and Separated Children fleeing from war in Ukraine. Dedicated Standard Operating Procedures were developed for transfers of unaccompanied minors from Moldova. Support is also provided to EU countries and relevant partners to adapt education systems, including through the publication of Guidance on integration in education, trainings, webinars and coordination of activities under the EU Education Support Group for Ukraine. The majority of people fleeing the war in Ukraine are women and children. Travelling in these circumstances entails a risk of encountering traffickers. The EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator, in close cooperation with EU countries, Agencies and international partners, developed a Common Anti-Trafficking Plan to address the risks of trafficking in human beings and support potential victims. The Solidarity Platform endorsed the plan on 11 May 2022. Five objectives of the Common Anti-Trafficking plan: - Strengthen awareness regarding risks of trafficking in human beings and setting up dedicated helplines - Reinforce prevention against trafficking in human beings - Enhancing law enforcement and judicial response to trafficking in human beings - Improving early identification, support and protection of human trafficking victims - Addressing the risks of trafficking in human beings in non-EU countries, especially Ukraine and Moldova The EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator monitors the situation and implements the plan in cooperation with the National Rapporteurs and Equivalent Mechanisms of EU countries and EU Agencies. The Commission provided an update on the implementation of the Plan and adopted the report on progress in the fight against trafficking in human beings on 19 December 2022. The Commission pays special attention to the issue of human trafficking, and strongly encouraged EU countries in its Guidelines and Communication to take necessary measures. A webpage was created presenting practical tips on how to stay safe and avoid falling into the hands of traffickers. Transfers of refugees from Ukraine in Moldova Bordering Ukraine, Moldova has received many people fleeing the war. The Solidarity Platform coordinates transfers of refugees from Ukraine to Moldova and EU and Schengen Associated countries who pledged to welcome them. This helps reduce pressure on reception capacities in Moldova and avoid further congestion of reception capacities in EU countries that border Ukraine. Since the beginning of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, EU countries and Schengen Associated Countries offered to transfer nearly 18 000 people from Moldova. To facilitate the process of transfers from Moldova, the Commission developed standard operating procedures, including specific procedures for children in cooperation with EU countries, UNHCR, IOM and EU Agencies. EU Air Transfers are free transportation by plane from Moldova to directly selected EU countries, organised in collaboration with UNHCR, IOM and EU Member States and the Republic of Moldova. EU Support Hub for Internal Security and Border Management in Moldova Together with the Moldovan authorities, the European Commission set up the EU Support Hub for Internal Security and Border Management in Moldova. The war in Ukraine generated greater internal security risks within the EU and Moldova. To pro-actively identify and combat these risks, the Hub works across six priority areas: - Firearms trafficking - Migrant smuggling - Trafficking in human beings - Preventing and countering terrorism and violent extremism - Cybercrime - Drug trafficking Bringing together representatives of Moldova’s and EU countries’ law enforcement officers, EU Agencies (Europol and Frontex) and the European Commission, the Hub is a unique platform that supports cooperation on internal security and border management. The Hub is based in Chișinău and coordinated by the Delegation of the European Union to Moldova. The Hub organises regular meetings to address security-related issues. So far, meetings have been on the topic of firearms, the EU-Moldova cooperation on internal security and the prevention of trafficking in human beings. The Commission is in close contact with its international partners, including the US, Canada, and the UK to: - Exchange information on initiatives that provide protection to displaced persons fleeing Ukraine - Assist countries facing most arrivals, including concrete support measures and offers of solidarity cooperation - Coordinate global protection efforts - Share updated situational awareness on Ukraine, discuss contingency planning and additional assistance The cooperation with international partners takes place through dedicated meetings of the Solidarity Platform, as well as technical meetings on a more regular basis. Almost half a million displaced people from Ukraine arrived in the UK, USA and Canada through their respective schemes. The war in Ukraine also generated internal security implications for Europe to which the EU responded in real time. EU actors quickly mobilised the European Multidisciplinary Platform Against Criminal Threats (EMPACT) to prevent organised crime and to tackle criminals trying to take advantage of the ongoing war. Great attention is also given to tackle the risks and prevent trafficking in human beings by Europol, present in all EU countries bordering Ukraine and Moldova. The internal security dialogue with Ukraine is ongoing and aims to enhance information exchange and to strengthen cooperation to address common security threats, such as trafficking in human beings, trafficking of firearms and counterterrorism. Moreover, Europol is providing operational support to all EU countries bordering Ukraine and Moldova. Since the start of the invasion, the EU rapidly released adequate funding to EU countries to support people fleeing the war and assist with border management. Total additional funding provided by the EU through Cohesion Action for Refugees in Europe (CARE) and FAST-CARE packages amounts to EUR 13.6 billion. Moreover, EUR 400 million in Emergency Assistance funding was mobilised from Home Affairs Funds. The Migration Preparedness and Crisis Blueprint Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the European Commission has coordinated the EU response through the EU Migration Preparedness and Crisis Blueprint. The Migration Preparedness and Crisis Blueprint provides an operational framework to ensure: - situational awareness and better preparedness, - effective governance and timely response. The Blueprint has been actively involved in gathering and reporting latest developments with EU Member States and Agencies. Information is collected and disseminated for better management of migration. Border management To help border guards of EU countries manage arrivals at the borders with Ukraine efficiently, while reducing the waiting time, but still maintaining a high level of security, on 2 March 2022 the Commission issued guidelines on external border management. The guidelines include provisions on: - simplification of border controls at the EU's borders with Ukraine - flexibility regarding entry conditions - allowing crossings at temporary border crossing points, outside official border crossing points - easy access for rescue services and humanitarian assistance - personal belongings and pets The guidelines strongly recommend EU countries to make use of the support of EU Agencies – with Frontex able to assist with the identification and registration of the people arriving, and Europol available to deploy officers supporting EU countries with secondary checks. EU Agencies playing a key role on the ground EU Agencies play a key role in assisting EU countries on the ground with border management, information-sharing, asylum registrations and preventing criminal networks from taking advantage of vulnerable people.

These teams, comprised of Europol specialists and guest officers, support the national authorities with secondary security checks and investigations at the EU external borders to identify criminals and terrorists trying to enter the EU in the refugee flow and exploit the situation. They also gather information in the field, which is used to develop criminal threat assessments and to support investigations. Frontex – the EuropeanBorder and Coast Guard Agency, officers are present on the ground to support first entry EU countries. Two operational activities along the border with Ukraine are ongoing since 26 January (Joint Operation Terra and Joint Operation Coordination Points 2022). n addition, to support Moldova in border management, the EU signed an agreement with Moldova on border management cooperation between Moldovan border guards and the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) on 17 March 2022.Currently, Frontex officers help with: - screening, registration and identity checks of people crossing the border - border surveillance tasks - help in the collection and exchange of information To coordinate the Agency’s efforts to support EU countries with Ukraine-related asylum and reception needs, the European Agency for Asylum (EUAA) appointed the Ukraine Emergency Response Board (UERB) on 7 March 2022 and assists in the implementation of the Temporary Protection Directive. EUAA is also present in Moldova, to provide support and information provision for people fleeing the war.

https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/the-west-finances-protests-and-destabilises-the-situation-in-georgia/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/16/mps-in-georgia-agree-draft-of-repressive-foreign-agents-bill-amid-protests,2024-04-16,"Georgian lawmakers have agreed an early draft of a controversial “foreign influence” bill, sparking fresh street protests against the legislation criticised for mirroring a repressive Russian law. The bill has sparked outrage in Georgia and concern in the west, with many arguing it undermines Georgia’s bid for EU membership. Lawmakers voted 78 to 25 to move the draft bill along for further debate. Georgia’s president, Salome Zurabishbili – who is at loggerheads with the ruling party – condemned the move as “against the will of the population”. It “is a direct provocation – a Russian strategy of destabilisation”, she said. Thousands rallied in the evening outside the parliament building in Tbilisi, blocking traffic on the main thoroughfare of the Georgian capital, whistling and shouting: “No to the Russian law!” An AFP journalist witnessed riot police cordoning off entrances to the legislature and demonstrators briefly scuffled with them, attempting to push against the police line. Police used pepper spray against the crowds and several protesters were detained. Water cannon was on standby. The interior ministry said one police officer had been injured and called on protesters to follow police instructions. “In case the rally participants continue their illegal actions, the ministry of internal affairs will take special measures defined by law,” it said in a statement. University student Kote Tatishvili, one of the demonstrators, said “Georgians will never accept this Russian law”. “We, peaceful demonstrators, will prevail, we will force Russian stooges in the Georgian Dream [ruling party] to withdraw the law,” he said. A day earlier, police had detained 14 demonstrators as about 10,000 people took to the streets. The EU has called on Tbilisi not to pass the legislation, saying it contradicted the democratic reforms the country was required to pursue to progress on its path towards membership of the bloc. Renewing Brussels’ criticism of the proposals, the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, said on Tuesday: “The draft law on transparency of foreign influence is not consistent with Georgia’s EU aspiration and its accession trajectory.” It “will bring Georgia further away from the EU and not closer”, he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Amnesty International urged Georgian authorities to “immediately stop their incessant efforts to impose repressive legislation on the country’s vibrant civil society”. It said the draft law “poses a direct threat to the rights to freedom of association and expression”. The ruling Georgian Dream party controls 84 seats in the 150-member legislature and can pass the law without opposition backing. If adopted, the bill will require any independent NGO and media organisation that receives more than 20% of funding from abroad to register as an “organisation pursuing the interests of a foreign power”. That was a change from last year’s proposal, which used the term “agent of foreign influence”. The term “foreign agent” is rooted in the Soviet past and suggests such people are traitors and enemies of the state. A similar law is used in Russia to punish government critics and suffocate independent media. In December, the EU granted Georgia official candidate status but said Tbilisi would have to reform its judicial and electoral systems, reduce political polarisation, improve press freedom and curtail the power of oligarchs before membership talks are formally launched. US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said last week that passing the law would “derail Georgia from its European path”. The ruling party was forced to drop a similar measure last year, following mass protests in which police used water cannon and teargas against demonstrators. Then in a surprise move before October’s parliamentary elections, which are seen as a key democratic test, it re-introduced the bill in parliament this month. A former Soviet republic, Georgia has sought for years to deepen relations with the west but the current ruling party is accused of trying to steer the Black Sea nation toward closer ties with Russia. Once seen as leading the democratic transformation of ex-Soviet countries, Georgia has in recent years been criticised for perceived democratic backsliding.",CREDIBLE

It overlooks the Mediterranean, with spectacular sunrises. Lemons and oranges droop from trees, brightly coloured homes dot the shore and Villajoyosa is famous for its chocolate. The name means Joyful Town. More importantly, Kuzminov must have calculated he could blend into the Russian and Ukrainian communities that fill this corner of Spain with Slavic languages, food and faces. With a new identity – a passport claimed he was Igor Shevchenko – here was a place to hide in plain sight, safe from the vengeance of Vladimir Putin. The fugitive Russian pilot was discreet. He lived in an apartment block ringed by other apartment blocks, learned some Spanish, breakfasted on coffee, toast and ham alone at a nearby cafe and mostly steered clear of fellow Russians. He avoided the supermarket with eastern European pastries and 52 brands of vodka. It might have been lonely, but it was, at least, life. The fantasy of escape ended on 13 February when gunmen shot the 28-year-old six times in his apartment complex’s underground car park. The reported use of Russian bullets and the undisguised glee in Moscow reinforced the point: you cannot defect to Ukraine with an army helicopter, deliver a propaganda coup to the Kremlin’s enemies, pocket a payment equivalent to $500,000, leave the relative sanctuary of Kyiv and expect to survive. “Chronicle of an execution foretold,” said the Spanish newspaper El Periódico, paraphrasing Gabriel García Márquez’s novella, and it was hard to dispute the sense of inevitability. “We all know what happens when you anger Mr Putin,” said a neighbour from the Netherlands, who lived in a block adjoining Kuzminov’s. Sources inside Ukraine’s military intelligence agency said they had warned Kuzminov that they could not protect him if he left the relative safety of Ukraine for western Europe. They told him explicitly that Russian assassins could – sooner or later – come after him. Kuzminov ignored their advice. He told them Spain was a democratic and law-abiding country where he would surely be protected. “He was naive,” one source in Kyiv said, adding that Ukraine had paid him €500,000. “He wanted a comfortable life and was convinced that with such a sum of money, Europe would be more attractive than Ukraine.” Such was the shock and anxiety, few residents of the apartment block in Villajoyosa wished to give their names or in some cases even acknowledge the nature of what happened. “I heard about the accident,” said one man, with an east European accent. Initially the assassination did resemble an accident. No one heard shooting on the evening of 13 February. The elderly Spanish resident who discovered the body on the basement ramp thought Kuzminov had been run over. He fetched the caretaker, Ruben, who assumed the same. “It was when the ambulance crew cut off his clothes we saw the bullet holes,” said Ruben, who declined to give a last name. Video surveillance cameras in the basement were working, he added. Two suspects are believed to have fled in a white Hyundai SUV that was found burning a short while after the murder about 11 miles south, just outside El Campello. Thus the former army captain joined Alexei Navalny, Alexander Litvinenko, Boris Nemtsov, Anna Politkovskaya, Boris Berezovsky and others on the growing list of Kremlin foes who have ended up shot, poisoned, hanged or dead from unclear circumstances. The novelty was the brazenness and the location. For Putin’s regime, it would seem Kuzminov’s offence merited high-profile retribution. Last August he piloted a twin-engine Mi-8 AMTSh helicopter from Russia to Ukrainian territory. Two crew members were killed after landing. At a press conference in Kyiv, flanked by two uniformed Ukrainian service personnel, the defector said he wanted to strike a blow against the invasion. “I don’t want to be complicit in Russian crimes.” Moscow responded with cold fury. Russian state TV showed a man described as a Russian intelligence officer saying: “I don’t think he’ll live long enough to face trial.” Kuzminov could have stayed in Ukraine. Military intelligence officers who coordinated his defection say he initially agreed to join the Freedom of Russia Legion, a group of Russian volunteers fighting with Ukraine. Two months later, however, he changed his mind. “It was his choice,” one officer said. He added that Kuzminov had not read the works of Viktor Suvorov, a Russian defector turned writer, who laid bare the brutal methods of Moscow military intelligence. Last October, officials in Kyiv gave Kuzminov a Ukrainian passport, GG843153. He moved to Spain in the guise of Igor Shevchenko, aged 33, with Spanish authorities unaware of his real identity, Spanish media reported. Villajoyosa was a risky choice. A picturesque town between Alicante and Benidorm, it has 36,000 residents, including 800 Russians and 1,200 Ukrainians, any of whom might have recognised him from the press conference. He lived in a neighbourhood called La Cala in a complex two blocks from the beach and a police station. The only communal amenity there is a pool, which is empty. Neighbours said he lived on the ninth – the top – floor. It has four apartments. A young man in one of them declined to comment, the other doors remained shut. Perhaps Kuzminov felt anonymous. Many residents are foreigners and there is flux, with people often moving in or out, said Ruben. The caretaker had one interaction with Kuzminov: in December he advised him about where to dispose of kitchen debris. The fugitive, it seems, was refurbishing. Unconfirmed reports say Russian intelligence located him when he invited a former girlfriend to visit. The killers’ swift getaway and the lack of witnesses suggest professional surveillance and planning for what would be the first Russian state killing in Spain. The case presents a dilemma for the Spanish authorities. Intelligence services do not doubt Moscow’s culpability but say it will be “very difficult” to obtain incriminating evidence, according to El País. Police have offered few updates on the investigation and Madrid has played for time. “We have to let the Guardia Civil do its job and for the investigation to progress,” said Pilar Alegría, a government spokesperson. Moscow has not claimed responsibility but exuded satisfaction. “This traitor and criminal became a moral corpse at the very moment when he planned his dirty and terrible crime,” said Sergei Naryshkin, the chief of Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence service. Villajoyosa, meanwhile, is trying to return to normality and reclaim its mantle of cheer. Soon the sun will warm, tourists will come and labourers will pick the lemons and oranges. For whomever sent the killers, a slab at the Alicante Institute of Legal Medicine holds a very different harvest.",CREDIBLE

Reports from international election observation missions clearly state that the presidential elections on 28th July did not meet international standards of electoral integrity. Despite its own commitment, the National Electoral Council of Venezuela (CNE) has not yet published the official voting records (“actas”) of polling stations. Without evidence to support them, the results published on 2nd August by the CNE cannot be recognised. Any attempt to delay the full publication of the official voting records will only cast further doubt on the credibility of the officially published results. Copies of the electoral voting records published by the opposition, and reviewed by several independent organisations, indicate that Edmundo González Urrutia would appear to be the winner of the Presidential elections by a significant majority. The European Union thus calls for further independent verification of the electoral records, if possible by an internationally reputed entity. At this critical time, it is important that demonstrations and protests remain peaceful. The European Union calls for calm and restraint. Venezuelan authorities, including security forces, must fully respect human rights, including freedom of expression and of assembly. The European Union is seriously concerned about the growing number of arbitrary detentions and the continued harassment of the opposition. The European Union calls on Venezuelan authorities to put an end to arbitrary detentions, repression and violent rhetoric against members of the opposition and civil society, and to release all political prisoners. The European Union welcomes the efforts of regional partners, with whom it remains in close contact, to promote dialogue and a negotiated solution to the crisis. Respecting the will of the Venezuelan people remains the only way for Venezuela to restore democracy and to solve the current humanitarian and socio-economic crisis. The candidate countries North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Albania, Ukraine, Republic of Moldova, Bosnia and Herzegovina* and Georgia, as well as the EFTA countries Iceland and Liechtenstein, members of the European Economic Area, align themselves with this statement. * North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina continue to be part of the Stabilisation and Association Process Last review: 25 November 2024",CREDIBLE
https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/the-uk-ukraine-treaty-of-january-2024-is-as-worthless-as-the-1939-agreement-with-poland/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/12/sunak-kyiv-ukraine-aid-britain/,2024-01-12,"KYIV — On a visit to Kyiv, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced Friday that the United Kingdom would provide Ukraine with more than $3 billion in additional military aid and signed bilateral security guarantees between London and Kyiv — the first such agreement on concrete security pledges, which Ukraine has sought as protection against further aggression by Russia. Speaking at a signing ceremony in Kyiv, Sunak said that “in the event of a future Russian attack,” London will provide “swift and sustained security assistance, military equipment across land, sea and air domains, economic assistance,” as well as “economic and other costs on Russia.” “It’s important that Russia sees that we are not moving away, that we will be with Ukraine, not just today, not just tomorrow, but for the long term,” Sunak said. Given that Russian President Vladimir Putin has vowed that his current attack on Ukraine will continue until his objectives are achieved, the agreement seemed largely intended as a message to the Kremlin that it should not expect British support for Ukraine to fade anytime soon. Britain is already one of Ukraine’s strongest supporters, but Sunak’s visit delivered a particularly uplifting message for Kyiv at a moment when Russia has stepped up its aerial bombardment campaign and when other, larger proposed aid packages from the United States and the European Union are stalled in Washington and Brussels. Although the British assistance is relatively small compared with more than $60 billion sought by President Biden and, so far, blocked in Congress, Sunak’s announcement demonstrated his country’s commitment in the face of Russia’s continued aggression against Ukraine and its unchecked disregard for internationally recognized borders. Sunak said that the U.K. to date had delivered some $15 billion in aid to Ukraine. The security accord, called the U.K.-Ukraine Agreement on Security Cooperation, intends “to be the first step in developing an unshakable hundred-year partnership between Ukraine and the United Kingdom,” a British government statement said. London would also “provide intelligence sharing, cybersecurity, medical and military training, and defense industrial cooperation,” the statement said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the agreement would last 10 years and can be extended, remaining in effect until Ukraine joins NATO. (So far, allies have not extended an invitation to Ukraine to join.) Zelensky speculated that a similar agreement might have prevented Russia’s invasions of Ukraine in 2014 and 2022. If “this level of guarantees had been reached” with the U.K. and other countries in the period since Ukraine became independent, he said, “there simply would have been no Russian aggression.” According to the agreement, in the case of a Russian attack, London commits to consult with Kyiv “within 24 hours to determine measures needed to counter or deter the aggression” and provide security assistance, a spokesperson for the U.K. prime minister said. “This is a clear, specific and significant commitment,” the spokesperson said. “The agreement is designed to provide significant security assurances as Ukraine progresses its NATO membership.” The spokesperson noted, however, that the security agreement did not provide the same mutual defense obligation as is provided under Article 5 of NATO’s founding treaty. “It’s not directly equivalent,” the spokesperson said. Support for Ukraine has emerged as a central thrust of London’s foreign policy since Britain left the European Union — and it has provided a means for successive Conservative prime ministers to divert attention from internal political strife. It has also provided a way for London to distinguish itself from European governments, some of whom have wavered in their military assistance to Ukraine, or, as in the cases of Hungary and Slovakia, rejected it outright. Kyiv has sought security commitments from Western governments that could deter Russia and send a signal to Moscow that support for Ukraine remains strong. The Group of Seven countries agreed to a framework of security guarantees at the NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, in July, with individual states intended to negotiate and sign bilateral agreements separately. “The U.K. is the first country to deliver a final agreement,” the government statement said. Sunak also arrived in Kyiv with a pledge to provide some $250 million more in military aid than the previous two years. Much of this sum would be spent “on a major push to rapidly procure and produce thousands of military drones for Ukraine, including surveillance, long-range strike and sea drones,” the statement said. “This will be the largest delivery of drones to Ukraine from any nation,” the statement said. “Most of the drones are expected to be manufactured in the U.K.” Sunak’s visit takes place as questions have arisen over the West’s commitment to helping Ukraine defend itself. Some Republicans in Congress have blocked Biden’s proposal and sought to link it to provisions for U.S. border security. On Thursday, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that assistance to Ukraine has “ground to a halt,” as the last aid package under existing financial support had been disbursed. In Brussels, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has thrown up obstacles to new European Union assistance. Sunak, by contrast, arrived in Kyiv on Friday with a message of steadfast support. “Ukraine is not alone — and indeed Ukraine will never be alone,” Sunak said in Kyiv. “Putin might think that he can outlast us, but he is wrong.” Serhiy Morgunov in Lisbon contributed to this report.",CREDIBLE

Drafted by representatives with different legal and cultural backgrounds from all regions of the world, the Declaration was proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in Paris on 10 December 1948 (General Assembly resolution 217 A) as a common standard of achievements for all peoples and all nations. It sets out, for the first time, fundamental human rights to be universally protected and it has been translated into over 500 languages.

https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/venezuela-is-successfully-counteracting-a-colour-revolution/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/29/venezuela-presidential-election-result-maduro/,2024-07-29,"CARACAS, Venezuela — The United States and several Latin American countries cast doubt Monday on President Nicolás Maduro’s reelection on Sunday, ordinary Venezuelans took to the streets and opposition leaders prepared to reveal what some said was evidence of brazen electoral fraud. On Monday evening, opposition leaders said they had collected more than 73 percent of voting center records, and they proved that González won twice as many votes as Maduro. That was similar to independent exit polling released Sunday evening. “We have in our hands the tallies that show our triumph, which is categorically and mathematically irreversible,” González told reporters. “Our triumph is historic.” Earlier Monday, council President Elvis Amoroso declared Maduro president for another six-year term — suggesting that a recount would not change the outcome announced earlier in the day. Opposition leaders, who had seen the election as its best chance in more than a decade of defeating Maduro, demanded he hand over scanned printouts of all voting records — more than 30,000 documents — signed and dated by poll workers and opposition observers, and not just the numbers shown on the government webpage. Biden administration officials and the Atlanta-based Carter Center, which sent a technical observation team to monitor Sunday’s vote, made similar calls. Opposition leaders, who organized, trained and sent thousands of ordinary citizens to polling places Sunday in anticipation of potential fraud, said they would release the records publicly on Monday night. According to their information, opposition leader María Corina Machado said, Maduro’s win was “impossible.” “We won, and the whole world knows it,” she told reporters. If the accusations of fraud prove true, it would mark uncharted territory even for a strongman who has been suspected of manipulating or tampering with elections on the margins several times over the past decade. Maduro has been accused of coercion, manipulation and other tricks to tip the vote a few percentage points in his favor, but never before has he been accused of reversing a gap as large as the opposition is suggesting, according to electronic engineer Mario Torre, who’s auditing the electoral system for the opposition. “For the first time they dare to give a result that is not the one that the system reflects,” Torre said. “We’re talking about a massive fraud.” On Monday afternoon, voters across Venezuela poured into the streets, apparently of their own accord, and notably in working-class neighborhoods that have historically been strongholds of support for Maduro and his late mentor, Hugo Chávez. The protesters banged pots and pans and demanded Maduro step down. “We don’t agree with the fraud President Maduro committed,” said Marjory Rojas, a 40-year-old housekeeper from a working-class neighborhood in Baruta who was protesting along a highway in Caracas. “I have three children living outside of the country, and he’s saying he won? We want him to leave. It’s not fair what they’re doing to the country.” Machado, by far Venezuela’s most popular opposition leader, called the protests a legitimate outpouring of frustration against an “illegitimate regime.” “Today we are seeing expressions from citizens who are refusing to have their future robbed, to have the truth ignored,” she said. She called on Venezuelan families to gather Tuesday morning in “popular assemblies.” U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby on Monday called on Maduro to publish “the full, detailed tabulation of votes.” “We’re going to withhold judgment until that time … and [then] we will respond accordingly,” he said. Two senior Biden administration officials said Maduro’s government has all the voting data now and could release it immediately. That data, one said, is “required under Venezuelan law and should be immediately providable.” The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under terms set by the administration, said they had received ample information from multiple sources indicating that the results announced by the electoral council were “at odds with how people actually voted … potentially substantially at odds.” The officials declined to detail possible next steps. One said the administration would “continue to assess our sanctions policy” in light of “the action or non-action” taken by the Maduro government and U.S. interests. But it was unlikely, one said, that the administration would cancel the licenses provided to Chevron and other oil companies allowing them to do business in Venezuela. Maduro has ruled Venezuela since the death of Chávez, founder of the socialist state, in 2013. Many here blame him for the oil-rich country’s economic collapse and the exodus of millions of citizens, including hundreds of thousands who have fled to the United States. Some Latin American countries, including Colombia and Brazil, which have friendly ties to Maduro, joined in the skepticism about the announced results, as did Spain, Italy and other European nations. Celso Amorim, a top foreign policy adviser to Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, one of Maduro’s most important leftist allies, was reserving judgment. Amorim was visiting the Miraflores presidential palace on Monday afternoon to meet with Maduro. He was also hoping to meet with González before reaching an assessment, according to a diplomatic official who was in Caracas with him, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the talks. Russia, China, Iran and Cuba congratulated Maduro. In a memo, the opposition campaign declared the vote a “FRAUD” and said the “burden of proof” was on the government. “Months will go by and they will not be able to deliver it to us. That is what we have to achieve, demanded by us and by the international community,” the memo’s authors wrote. On Monday, Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek William Saab said the electoral data transmission system suffered an attempted “attack,” and he accused opposition leaders Lester Toledo and Leopoldo López of carrying it out to “manipulate the data.” He also accused Machado of being involved, providing no evidence. “What has happened in our country is a huge social movement that they will not stop,” said Machado, Venezuela’s most popular politician. “We are a civic peaceful movement, and that’s how we will keep working until we make the truth prevail — and it will prevail.” In the run-up to the election, Maduro’s government barred Machado from running, arrested campaign workers and denied the opposition access to state media. During voting on Sunday, there were reports of blocked entry, delays and violence at some voting centers. Maduro’s claims threatened to increase his and Venezuela’s isolation on the world stage. His Foreign Ministry said Monday it was withdrawing all of Venezuela’s diplomats from seven Latin American countries, including Argentina, Chile and Peru, and demanding those countries’ governments respond in kind. (Maduro severed diplomatic relations with the United States in 2019.) Maduro’s government announced it would be suspending flights to and from Panama and the Dominican Republic, accusing both countries of being “interveners.” Both countries serve as important routes into and out of Venezuela from the United States and other countries. He’s been down this road before. In 2018, he claimed reelection in a vote marred by charges of irregularities, prompting mass protests at home and condemnation abroad. The United States and other countries declared Maduro illegitimate and recognized then-National Assembly President Juan Guaidó as Venezuela’s rightful leader. In a statement early Monday, Maduro claimed without evidence that the electoral council had been hacked from an unnamed country, causing a delay in the publication of the full election results. “The demons and the devils did not want the total to be counted,” Maduro said. Latin American leaders across the political spectrum cast doubt on the results. Luis Gilberto Murillo, foreign minister under leftist Colombian President Gustavo Petro, called for an independent verification and audit of the vote count “as soon as possible.” Center-left Chilean President Gabriel Boric described the official results as “difficult to believe” and demanded that international observers be given access to the full results. “From Chile, we will not recognize any result that is not verifiable,” he wrote on X early Monday. On the other end of the political spectrum, right-wing Argentine President Javier Milei, too, said he would not recognize a “fraud.” “Venezuelans chose to end the communist dictatorship of Nicolás Maduro,” he posted on X. He called on Venezuela’s armed forces to “defend democracy and the popular will.” Peruvian Foreign Minister Javier González-Olaechea accused Maduro’s regime of having the “intention of fraud” and recalled Peru’s ambassador to Venezuela for consultations. “Peru will not accept the violation of the popular will of the Venezuelan people,” he said on X. Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Panama, Paraguay, the Dominican Republic and Uruguay also issued calls for a transparent count of the votes by independent observers. Meanwhile, Russia, China, Iran, Cuba, Bolivia and Honduras — all allies of Maduro — congratulated him. The Russian ambassador to Caracas described the victory as “credible,” and President Vladimir Putin sent his best wishes. “Remember that you are always a welcome guest on Russian soil,” he told Maduro. China’s Foreign Ministry congratulated Maduro and Venezuela on their “successful” election. “China and Venezuela are good friends and partners who support each other,” spokesman Lin Jian told reporters, according to state media. Cuba’s Raúl Castro, the younger brother of the late Fidel Castro and a former premier of the communist island nation himself, called Maduro to congratulate him, Cuba’s Foreign Ministry said.

Türkiye-backed armed groups unlawfully killed four civilians. The government and armed groups denied civilians access to humanitarian aid. The government continued to subject tens of thousands of people to enforced disappearance; the UN General Assembly established an international institution to clarify the fate of missing people and provide reparation to families of victims. The government and armed forces arbitrarily detained individuals for expressing their views. Refugees remained at risk of arrest upon return to Syria. The government continued to prevent residents and internally displaced people in north-west Syria from accessing essential services, violating their economic and social rights. The government violated the right to housing of residents in Aleppo city whose homes were affected by powerful earthquakes on 6 February. The Israeli military violently quelled protests against the installation of turbines in the Golan Heights, a Syrian area occupied by Israel for 56 years. Background On 27 January, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons concluded that there are “reasonable grounds to believe” that the Syrian government used chemical weapons in attacks on 7 April 2018 in Douma, a city in Damascus Countryside Governorate. On 6 February, two earthquakes struck south-eastern Türkiye and northern Syria with a magnitude of 7.8 and 7.5, respectively. The UN estimated that at least 6,000 people in Syria were killed, 400,000 families were displaced and over 8.8 million people were in urgent need of assistance. The earthquakes compounded dire economic conditions as more than half of the population was already food insecure. On 7 May, the Arab League reinstated Syria’s membership after its suspension in November 2011 for its brutal crackdown on peaceful protests. On 27 August, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the military force of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES), arrested Ahmad al-Khabil, head of the military council in Deir ez-Zor city, for allegedly communicating with the Syrian government. His arrest triggered armed clashes between SDF forces and Arab tribes affiliated with Ahmad al-Khabil, which displaced at least 50,000 people to government-controlled areas. In September, thousands of people in Sweida, a Druze-majority city in south-west Syria, protested the deteriorating economic conditions, calling for “regime” change. Israel continued its air strikes on Syrian government, Iranian and (Lebanese) Hizbullah forces in Syria. On 12 October, in the context of the armed conflict in Gaza (see Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and Palestine entries), Israel attacked by air Aleppo and Damascus international airports simultaneously. Three days later, pro-government forces launched rockets on the occupied Golan Heights. By the end of 2023, 5.6 million Syrians had sought refuge outside the country since the conflict began in 2011. Unlawful attacks All parties to the conflict and their allies continued to conduct unlawful ground and aerial attacks on civilians and civilian objects in northern Syria, killing and injuring scores of civilians and destroying vital infrastructure indispensable for their survival. Syrian government and its ally Russia The Syrian government, supported by Russian government forces, escalated aerial attacks on civilians and civilian objects in north-west Syria, a region under the control of armed opposition groups, between October and December. According to the UN, as of 21 December, these attacks had killed 99 civilians and injured over 400 others. The UN added that 23 health facilities and 17 schools were damaged. Prior to this escalation, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic (UN Commission of Inquiry) reported that the Syrian government had launched multiple unlawful ground attacks in north-west Syria. On 9 April, government forces shelled the densely populated centre of Sarmin town, east of Idlib city and around 5km from the nearest front line, killing a 13-year-old boy and injuring three other children who were playing outside. On 22 June, government forces launched two unguided rockets on Sarmin town, killing one woman and injuring a boy and four women. The UN Commission of Inquiry also documented an air strike by Russian armed forces at 10am on 25 June on a residential building that the commission said was possibly used by an armed group, adjacent to a vegetable market in Jisr al-Shughur city in Idlib governorate, killing three civilians and injuring 34 others. Türkiye According to the UN Commission of Inquiry, on 18 January, a “likely Turkish guided air-to-ground missile” fired from a drone struck a pickup truck driving past a supermarket on the Qamishli-Malkiyah road in Hassake governorate in north-east Syria, which is under the control of AANES, a staunch opponent of Türkiye and the Syrian National Army (SNA), a coalition of Türkiye-backed armed groups. The attack killed a man and an 11-year-old boy and injured several people who were in the supermarket. Türkiye further intensified aerial attacks on north-east Syria after the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) carried out a bomb attack on 1 October in Ankara, capital of Türkiye, which wounded two police officers. On 7 October, Turkish authorities said that 58 Kurdish fighters in north-east Syria had been killed in air strikes since the bomb attack. Kurdish authorities who govern north-east Syria reported that Turkish strikes on 5 and 6 October, which were in the vicinity of a displacement camp and several villages, killed 11 civilians and targeted at least three oil plants, two power stations, two hospitals and a school. The local authorities said the air strikes also caused power cuts affecting tens of thousands of residents in Hassake and Qamishli cities. Unlawful killings On 20 March, SNA members shot a Kurdish family in Jinderes town in northern Syria as they were celebrating Newroz, the Kurdish New Year. They killed four civilians and injured three others. The next day, the SNA arrested four armed fighters allegedly responsible for the attack but failed to disclose the outcome of their trial or whether victims and their families were provided with reparation. Denial of humanitarian access The Syrian government and SNA blocked access to humanitarian aid, including earthquake aid, in Aleppo governorate. Syrian government The authorities continued to restrict fuel and other essential supplies, including flour and medication, from reaching tens of thousands of civilians, including internally displaced people, living in predominantly Kurdish areas in the northern Aleppo region controlled by the Kurdish civilian council, affiliated with the AANES. During harsh weather, people burned household items and plastic to keep warm. Following the 6 February earthquakes, the authorities delayed aid deliveries to Sheikh Maksoud and Ashrafieh, two Kurdish-majority neighbourhoods in the north of Aleppo city, which exacerbated the humanitarian crisis. A humanitarian worker and local representative in north-east Syria told Amnesty International that it took seven days of negotiations for the government to allow 100 trucks carrying fuel and humanitarian aid sent by AANES to enter Sheikh Maksoud and Ashrafieh on 16 February, and only then on condition that they divert more than half of the aid to the government and that the government would be solely responsible for distributing the aid in these neighbourhoods. The government continued to block the entry of aid to 8,000 people living in Rukban camp, an informal settlement located in an isolated and inhospitable area between the Syria-Jordan border known as “the berm”. Residents lacked access to medical care, sanitation and clean water. On 20 June, the US military, based near Rukban camp, delivered essential supplies sent by US-based humanitarian organizations. Syrian National Army SNA armed groups supported by Türkiye obstructed aid from reaching people affected by the earthquakes in Afrin district in Aleppo governorate, shot in the air to disperse crowds trying to obtain assistance from aid trucks, and diverted earthquake aid to the armed groups’ relatives.1 Four people interviewed by Amnesty International confirmed that the SNA obstructed at least 30 fuel and other trucks carrying humanitarian aid sent by AANES from reaching areas under SNA control. The trucks waited at the border crossing between north-east Syria and northern Aleppo for seven days before AANES retrieved them. A Kurdish man whose home in a village in Afrin district was destroyed in the earthquake told Amnesty International that people needed wasta (connections) with armed groups to obtain any assistance, and that no one had arrived to help them. Arbitrary detention and enforced disappearances Syrian government The government continued to subject tens of thousands of people, including journalists, human rights defenders, lawyers and political activists, to enforced disappearance, many for more than 10 years. According to the UN Commission of Inquiry, government forces continued to arbitrarily arrest and detain individuals, including “through application of the cybercrime law to stifle criticism of government services or policy.” On 23 March, security forces arrested Rami Viatli, an activist, in Latakia governorate. Local sources said that his arrest was believed to be in response to his post on Facebook on 12 March in which he called on the authorities to hold torturers accountable. On 5 September, the authorities arrested Lama Abbas, a political activist, without an arrest warrant. Two days earlier, she had used social media to call on people living in Latakia not to sell their land. In April, Syrian security forces arrested at least six refugees who had been deported by the Lebanese authorities. Two former detainees told Amnesty International that Syrian security forces held them at a detention facility close to the Lebanese border, and they were only released after paying a bribe. They added that security forces transferred two of the arrested refugees to the Palestine branch of Syria’s military intelligence in Damascus for defecting from the army. Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, an al-Qaeda-affiliated armed group that controls much of Idlib governorate, continued to subject journalists, activists and anyone who criticized their rule to arbitrary detention without access to a lawyer or family members. The UN Commission of Inquiry reported that Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham detained a man for a week in Idlib in January after he criticized religious speeches. Right to truth, justice and reparation On 29 June, the UN General Assembly established an independent, international institution to clarify the fate and whereabouts of the tens of thousands of missing and forcibly disappeared people in Syria since 2011 and provide reparation to their families. On 8 September, a criminal court in France’s capital Paris announced that it will try in their absence three Syrian senior security officials accused of complicity in war crimes and crimes against humanity. The trials will be held in May 2024. On 10 October, the International Court of Justice (also known as the World Court) held the first public session in the case submitted by Canada and the Netherlands alleging that the Syrian government was violating the UN Convention against Torture. On 16 November, the court issued an order directing Syrian authorities to take all measures to prevent acts of torture and other detention-related abuses. On 15 November, French judges issued international arrest warrants for Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad, his brother Maher al-Assad and two other senior officials on charges of complicity in crimes against humanity and war crimes over the use of banned chemical weapons against civilians in Eastern Ghouta in Damascus Countryside in August 2013, which killed 1,000 people. Economic and social rights Around 4.4 million people in north-west Syria, including 2.9 million internally displaced people, continued to depend fully for their survival on UN-coordinated humanitarian assistance provided through the cross-border aid mechanism. Russia ended the cross-border mechanism on 11 July after it vetoed a UN Security Council resolution for its extension. On 9 August, the Syrian government reached an agreement with the UN to continue cross-border aid until mid-January 2024. The 6 February earthquakes exacerbated the humanitarian needs of residents in north-west Syria, including the increased number of people living in tents that offered minimal privacy or protection from extreme heat, cold or rain, with limited or no access to water, sanitation and healthcare. Right to housing Residents and humanitarian workers in Aleppo city reported that assessments conducted by engineering committees, formed by the authorities to assess the structural safety of buildings, might not have been done meticulously and that the demolitions carried out after the 6 February earthquakes did not comply with due process requirements and safeguards against forced evictions as described in international human rights standards.2 Residents were unable to challenge the committees’ decisions and were often not given enough time to remove their belongings before demolitions. In some cases, residents whose homes were demolished because they were deemed unsafe for habitation were not offered alternative housing or compensation. In addition, residents seeking to repair their homes damaged by the earthquakes faced bureaucratic obstacles. Occupied Golan Heights The Golan Heights remained under Israel’s occupation and illegal annexation. On 22 June, Israeli forces responded violently to quell protests by the Syrian Druze community, a religious minority, against the construction of wind turbines in the area. According to media sources, 20 protesters were injured. Right to a healthy environment Syria continued to face a multi-year drought due to increased temperatures driven by climate change and exacerbated by other factors, including water management failures. Damage, destruction and neglect of key water sites and infrastructure by warring parties during the conflict, as well as continued obstruction of aid, further exacerbated the impact of droughts on people in Syria.",CREDIBLE

Both the Russian Federation and Ukraine have accused one another and reported allegations of use of chemical weapons to the Organisation. A compendium of all official correspondence by States Parties on such allegations and accusations has been made available on the OPCW public website and is regularly updated. The information provided to the Organisation so far by both sides, together with the information available to the Secretariat, is insufficiently substantiated. Still, the situation remains volatile and extremely concerning regarding the possible re-emergence of use of toxic chemicals as weapons. The destruction of all declared chemical weapons stockpiles in the world was achieved in July 2023 under strict verification of the OPCW Secretariat. This does not mean that chemical weapons do not exist anymore. Under the Chemical Weapons Convention, any toxic chemical, used for its toxic properties with the purpose to cause harm or death is considered a chemical weapon. This includes the diversion of dual-use toxic chemicals produced worldwide by the chemical industry from their declared non-prohibited purposes. Additionally, under the Convention, States Parties have the obligation to declare all toxic chemical agents they hold for riot control purposes. It is against the Convention to use riot control agents at war on the battlefield. If used as a method of warfare, these agents are considered chemical weapons and, hence, are prohibited under the Convention. Moreover, under Article II, paragraph 7 of the Convention, a Riot Control Agent is defined as any chemical not listed in a Schedule, which can produce rapidly in humans sensory irritation or disabling effects which disappear within a short time following termination of exposure. Accordingly, any use, as a Riot Control Agent, of a toxic chemical belonging to one of the three Schedules listed in the Annex to the Convention on Chemicals would be contrary to the Convention. On 1 May, the United States of America announced that it had imposed new measures on the Russian Federation for its full-scale war and use of chemical weapons against Ukraine, including for its use of chloropicrin, a chemical belonging to Schedule 3 of the Convention, as well as riot control agents as a method of warfare. For its part, the Russian Federation has denied making use of such weapons. It is recalled that, to conduct any activities pertaining to allegations of use of toxic chemicals as weapons, the Secretariat of the OPCW would need to be formally seized of a request to conduct such activity by States Parties. So far, the Secretariat has not received any such request for action. We will continue to monitor the situation and maintain our readiness to deploy. We remain in contact with concerned States Parties and invite those that may have substantiated information to share it with the Secretariat. In the meantime, the OPCW will continue to provide support to Ukraine, upon its request, in the field of assistance and protection against chemical weapons under Article X of the Convention. In this framework, the Secretariat has been working on delivering training courses on emergency response, and the provision of protective, detection, and identification equipment, together with the relevant training. All 193 OPCW Member States, thus including the Russian Federation and Ukraine, have committed never to develop, produce, acquire, stockpile, transfer or use chemical weapons. States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention have declared that any use of chemical weapons is totally unacceptable and would violate the legal norms and standards of the international community.",CREDIBLE

The new restrictive measures target various members of the judiciary, the heads and deputy heads of various correctional institutions, business owners, part-owners, associates, or members of boards of directors benefitting from the Lukashenka regime, a transport and storage company and a company which benefits from the regime and facilitates the circumvention of EU sanctions. - 5 August New sanctions in view of human rights abuses in Belarus The Council imposed sanctions on a further 28 individuals responsible for the ongoing internal repression and human rights abuses in Belarus. Those sanctioned include members of the department for combating organised crime and corruption (HUBAZiK) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. They also include members of the judiciary, heads of correctional institutions and regime propagandists. These sanctions have been adopted ahead of the fourth anniversary of the fraudulent presidential elections of August 2020. - 29 June New sanctions against Belarus target the trade, services and transport sectors The Council adopted sanctions targeting the Belarusian economy, in view of the regime’s involvement in Russia’s illegal, unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine. These sanctions aim to mirror several of the restrictive measures already in place against Russia, and include: - a ban on the export of dual-use goods and technologies, maritime navigation goods and luxury goods to Belarus - a ban on the import of gold, diamonds, helium, coal and mineral products, including crude oil, from Belarus - a ban on the provision of certain services - a broader ban on the transport of goods by road within the EU territory - a requirement for EU exporters to insert the so-called 'no-Belarus clause' in future contracts - further anti-circumvention measures - 26 February EU prolongs sanctions against Belarus for another year The Council has decided to prolong the restrictive measures linked to internal repression in Belarus and regime’s support for Russia’s war against Ukraine for another year, until 28 February 2025. Since August 2020, the EU has imposed several successive rounds of individual and sectoral sanctions, against those responsible for internal repression and human rights abuses in Belarus, and in the context of Belarus’ involvement in Russia’s war against Ukraine. With these measures, the EU is signalling to the political and economic actors responsible that their actions and support for the regime and to Russia come at a cost. - 19 February EU reaffirms unwavering support for democracy and human rights in Belarus The Council approved conclusions reaffirming its unwavering support for the Belarusian people’s quest for a free, democratic, sovereign and independent Belarus as part of a peaceful and prosperous Europe. In its conclusions, the Council expresses its continued and deep concern about the deteriorating human rights situation in Belarus and strongly condemns the continued support provided by the Belarusian regime to Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. The EU has imposed targeted sanctions against the Lukashenka regime, and stands ready to take further restrictive and targeted measures as long as the Belarusian authorities continue their actions. - 2023 - 3 August EU adopts new sanctions against Belarus The Council imposed sanctions on an additional 38 individuals and 3 entities over continued human rights abuses. It also imposed further targeted measures in response to involvement in Russia's military aggression against Ukraine, extending export bans to firearms, aviation and space industry. - 27 February EU extends restrictive measures for another year The Council decided to extend for another year the restrictive measures linked to internal repression in Belarus and regime’s support for the war against Ukraine. The decision was taken on the basis of the annual review and considering the persistent gravity of the situation in the country and country’s involvement in the Russian aggression against Ukraine. The measures now apply until 28 February 2024. Targeted restrictive measures were adopted in response to the fraudulent nature of the August 2020 presidential elections in Belarus, and the intimidation and violent repression of peaceful protesters, opposition members and journalists. They were further expanded in response to Belarus’ involvement in the Russian aggression against Ukraine, and currently apply to 195 individuals and 34 entities. - 2022 - 3 June EU adopts new round of restrictive measures over internal repression The Council today decided to impose restrictive measures on an additional 12 individuals and 8 entities for their role in the ongoing internal repression and human rights abuses in Belarus. The listed individuals responsible for the repression of civil society and democratic opposition, or benefit from and support the Lukashenko regime. The new listings include high-ranking state officials, businesspeople and their families, members of the judicial sector, and prominent propagandists. - 9 March New measures in response to involvement in Russia's military invasion of Ukraine In response to the involvement of Belarus in the unjustified and unprovoked Russian military aggression against Ukraine, the Council has adopted additional measures targeting the Belarusian financial sector. The agreed measures will: - restrict the provision of specialised financial messaging services (SWIFT) to three Belarusian banks - prohibit transactions with the Central Bank of Belarus - prohibit the listing and provision of services in relation to shares of Belarusian state-owned entities on EU trading venues - significantly limit the financial inflows from Belarus to the EU - prohibit the provision of euro-denominated banknotes to Belarus - 2 March Sanctions in response to involvement in Russia's military invasion of Ukraine The EU condemns in the strongest possible terms Belarus' involvement in Russia's unprovoked and unjustified military invasion of Ukraine. In response to Belarus' actions, the EU has issued a package of individual and economic sanctions targeting 22 people and further restrictions on trade. - 24 February EU extends restrictive measures for another year The Council decided to extend the restrictive measures for another year in view of the situation in Belarus. The decision was taken on the basis of the annual review and considering the persistent gravity of the situation in the country. The measures now apply until 28 February 2023. Targeted restrictive measures were adopted in response to the fraudulent nature of the August 2020 presidential elections in Belarus, and the intimidation and violent repression of peaceful protesters, opposition members and journalists. They were further expanded in response to continued repression, human rights abuses and the instrumentalisation of migrants and currently apply to 183 individuals and 26 entities. - 2021 - 2 December Fifth package of sanctions over continued human rights abuses and the instrumentalisation of migrants On 2 December 2021, the Council imposed restrictive measures on an additional 17 individuals and 11 entities. The measures target prominent members of the judicial branch and propaganda outlets that contribute to the continued repression of civil society, democratic opposition, independent media outlets and journalists. The measures also targets high-ranking political officials of the Lukashenko regime, as well as companies (such as Belavia Airlines), tour operators and hotels that have helped incite and organise illegal border crossings through Belarus to the EU, and in this way participated in the instrumentalisation of migration for political purposes. - 15 November EU broadens scope for sanctions On 15 November, the Council amended its sanctions regime in view of the situation at the EU’s border with Belarus, so as to be able to respond to the instrumentalisation of human beings carried out by the Belarus regime for political purposes. The sanctions regime was amended by way of a Council decision and a Council regulation, which broaden the listing criteria on which specific designations can be based . The EU will now be able to target individuals and entities organising or contributing to activities by the Lukashenko regime that facilitate illegal crossing of the EU's external borders. - 21 June Fourth package of EU sanctions over enduring repression and the forced landing of a Ryanair flight On 21 June, the Council decided to impose restrictive measures against 78 Belarusian individuals and eight entities. This decision was made in view of the escalation of serious human rights violations in Belarus and the violent repression of civil society, democratic opposition and journalists. Moreover, seven individuals and one entity subject to this new round of restrictive measures were designated in connection to the forced and unlawful landing of a Ryanair flight in Minsk, Belarus, on 23 May 2021. EU restrictive measures on Belarus now apply to a total of 166 persons and 15 entities. Those designated are subject to an asset freeze and EU citizens and companies are forbidden from making funds available to those listed. - 21 June Candidate and EEA countries align themselves with Council Decision on airspace ban The Council Decision decided to strengthen the existing restrictive measures in view of the situation in Belarus by introducing a ban on the overflight of EU airspace and on access to EU airports by Belarusian carriers of all kinds. The Candidate Countries the Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Albania, and the members of the European Economic Area (EEA), align themselves with this Council Decision. - 4 June EU bans Belarusian air carriers The Council decided on 4 June to strengthen the existing restrictive measures in view of the situation in Belarus by introducing a ban on the overflight of EU airspace and on access to EU airports by Belarusian carriers of all kinds. EU member states will therefore be required to deny permission to land in, take off from or overfly their territories to any aircraft operated by Belarusian air carriers, including as a marketing carrier. - 24 May EU leaders condemn forced landing in Minsk and call for new sanctions The European Council strongly condemns the forced landing of a Ryanair flight in Minsk, Belarus, on 23 May 2021 endangering aviation safety, and the detention by Belarusian authorities of journalist Raman Pratasevich and Sofia Sapega. EU leaders invited the Council to adopt relevant sanctions concerning persons and entities as soon as possible - 2020 - 17 December EU imposes third round of sanctions over ongoing repression In response to the brutality of the Belarusian authorities and in support of the democratic rights of the Belarusian people, the Council decided to adopt 36 additional designations. These sanctions target high-level officials responsible for the ongoing violent repression and intimidation of peaceful demonstrators, opposition members and journalists, among others. They also target economic actors, prominent businessmen and companies benefiting from and/or supporting the regime of Aleksandr Lukashenko. - 16 November Alexandr Lukashenko and 14 other officials sanctioned over ongoing repression The Council added 15 members of the Belarusian authorities, including Alexandr Lukashenko as well as his son and National Security Adviser Viktor Lukashenko, to the list of individuals sanctioned in relation to the violent repression and intimidation of peaceful demonstrators, opposition members and journalists after the 2020 presidential election in Belarus. - 2 October EU imposes sanctions for repression and election falsification The Council imposed restrictive measures against 40 individuals identified as responsible for repression and intimidation against peaceful demonstrators, opposition members and journalists in the wake of the 2020 presidential election in Belarus, as well as for misconduct of the electoral process. Restrictive measures include a travel ban and an asset freeze. The travel ban impedes the listed people from entering or transiting through EU territories, while the asset freeze is used against the funds or economic resources of the listed persons. In addition, EU citizens and companies are forbidden from making funds available to those listed. - 14 August The EU foreign ministers address 2020 Belarusian presidential elections The EU foreign ministers address 2020 Belarusian presidential elections Ministers reiterated their repeated call to the Belarusian authorities to stop the disproportionate and unacceptable violence against peaceful protesters and to release those detained. During their discussions, the ministers sent a strong signal of the EU’s support to the Belarusian population in their desire for democratic change. - 1 October EU leaders agree that restrictive measures should be imposed EU leaders called on the Belarusian authorities to end violence and repression, release all detainees and political prisoners, respect media freedom and civil society, and start an inclusive national dialogue. They agreed that restrictive measures should be imposed and called on the Council to adopt the decision without delay. The European Council also encouraged the European Commission to prepare a plan of economic support for democratic Belarus. - 19 August EU leaders discuss Belarus elections As the elections in Belarus were neither free nor fair, and did not meet international standards, the EU does not recognise the results presented by the Belarus authorities. Leaders condemned the violence against peaceful protesters. They affirmed the EU expects a complete and transparent investigation into all alleged abuses, and that civil society and opposition actors must be protected from arbitrary arrests and violence.

Russian efforts are focused on undermining U.S. support for Ukraine while China seeks to exploit societal polarization and diminish faith in U.S. democratic systems. Additionally, fears that sophisticated AI deepfake videos would succeed in voter manipulation have not yet been borne out but simpler “shallow” AI-enhanced and AI audio fake content will likely have more success. These insights and analysis are contained in the second Microsoft Threat Intelligence Election Report published today. Russia deeply invested in undermining US support for Ukraine Russian influence operations (IO) have picked up steam in the past two months. The Microsoft Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) has tracked at least 70 Russian actors engaged in Ukraine-focused disinformation, using traditional and social media and a mix of covert and overt campaigns. For example, the actor Microsoft tracks as Storm-1516, has successfully laundered anti-Ukraine narratives into U.S. audiences using a consistent pattern across multiple languages. Typically, this group follows a three-stage process: - An individual presents as a whistleblower or citizen journalist, seeding a narrative on a purpose-built video channel - The video is then covered by a seemingly unaffiliated global network of covertly managed websites - Russian expats, officials, and fellow travellers then amplify this coverage. Ultimately, U.S. audiences repeat and repost the disinformation likely unaware of the original source. China seeks to widen societal divisions and undermine democratic systems China is using a multi-tiered approach in its election-focused activity. It capitalizes on existing socio-political divides and aligns its attacks with partisan interests to encourage organic circulation. China’s increasing use of AI in election-related influence campaigns is where it diverges from Russia. While Russia’s use of AI continues to evolve in impact, People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-linked actors leverage generative AI technologies to effectively create and enhance images, memes, and videos. Limited activity so far from Iran, a frequent late-game spoiler Iran’s past behavior suggests it will likely launch acute cyber-enabled influence operations closer to U.S. Election Day. Tehran’s election interference strategy adopts a distinct approach: combining cyber and influence operations for greater impact. The ongoing conflict in the Middle East may mean Iran evolves its planned goals and efforts directed at the U.S. Generative AI in Election 2024 – risks remain but differ from the expected Since the democratization of generative AI in late 2022, many have feared this technology will be used to change the outcome of elections. MTAC has worked with multiple teams across Microsoft to identify, triage, and analyze malicious nation-state use of generative AI in influence operations. In short, the use of high-production synthetic deepfake videos of world leaders and candidates has so far not caused mass deception and broad-based confusion. In fact, we have seen that audiences are more likely to gravitate towards and share simple digital forgeries, which have been used by influence actors over the past decade. For example, false news stories with real news agency logos embossed on them. Audiences do fall for generative AI content on occasion, though the scenarios that succeed have considerable nuance. Our report today explains how the following factors contribute to generative AI risk to elections in 2024: - AI-enhanced content is more influential than fully AI-generated content - AI audio is more impactful than AI video - Fake content purporting to come from a private setting such as a phone call is more effective than fake content from a public setting, such as a deepfake video of a world leader - Disinformation messaging has more cut-through during times of crisis and breaking news - Impersonations of lesser-known people work better than impersonations of very well-known people such as world leaders Leading up to Election Day, MTAC will continue identifying and analyzing malicious generative AI use and will update our assessment incrementally, as we expect Russia, Iran, and China will all increase the pace of influence and interference activity as November approaches. One caveat of critical note: If there is a sophisticated deepfake launched to influence the election in November, the tool used to make the manipulation has likely not yet entered the marketplace. Video, audio, and image AI tools of increasing sophistication enter the market nearly every day. The above assessment arises from what MTAC has observed thus far, but it is difficult to know what we’ll observe from generative AI between now and November. The above assessment arises from what MTAC has observed thus far, but as both generative AI and geopolitical goals from Russia, Iran, and China evolve between now and November, risks to the 2024 election may shift with time.",CREDIBLE

https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/according-to-a-leaked-document-ukrainian-president-petro-poroshenko-aims/,http://bit.ly/23mz00N),2025-01-07,"Russian media are claiming that Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko aims to establish a Crimean Tatar autonomy in the southeastern Ukrainian province of Kherson and populate the region with resettled Crimean Tatars and Turks. The source for this claim is an alleged draft presidential decree discovered on secure administration sited and published by Kyberberkut, a site that is notorious for publishing fake documents. In the past StopFake has debunked several Kyberberkut claims. The published document is an alleged secret presidential decree which creates a Crimean national autonomy on the territory of Kherson oblast, renames the city of Kherson into Khan Hyrey as the capital of the new Crimean Tatar autonomy and orders the resettlement of 500,000 Crimean Tatars and 200,000 Meskheti Turks to this territory. (Meskheti Turks are ethnic Turks formerly inhabiting the Meskheti region of Georogia along the border with Turkey, today they are widely dispersed throughout the former Soviet Union because of forced deportations during World War II.) Several Russian media featured stories based on this alleged leaked document. Russian National television channel Rossia 24 claimed Ukraine was turning Kherson province into a Crimean Khanate, Ren TV, Komsomolskaya Pravda, and a slew of separatist sites – Novostnoy Front, Pravda.ru, Novostnoe Agentstvo Kharkov, Novosti Russkogo Mira followed suit. The fake document violates several articles of the Ukrainian Constitution, the highest law of the land that cannot be superseded by presidential decrees. It is highly unlikely that the Presidential Administration would attempt to bypass the Constitution. The President has no right to change the names of cities, or to establish new territorial entities. Furthermore, on official presidential decree stationery, the Ukrainian trident, the country’s national symbol is gold, on the decree published by Russian sites, the trident is black.",CREDIBLE

Thank you so much for all this time that you supported and support us. Dear colleagues! I am glad to greet all of you! And I am glad that this format of cooperation – Joint Expeditionary Force – is effective and becoming stronger. Now is the time for collective efforts. It does not mean that capabilities of one nation are too weak. It means that the task we face is too big. We need reliable geopolitical stability in Europe and, more broadly, in the whole Euro-Atlantic space. So, we need new collective forms of cooperation and strengthening of existing ones. Because we see what modern aggressions and terrorist attacks are. If an enemy of freedom has significant resources and boundless cynicism – like Russia, like Hamas, like other terrorists – then free nations need a really full-scale defense… Fast, as flexible as possible, not limited by outdated procedures and one that can be maintained – as long as is needed. In our Euro-Atlantic space we have NATO. Mainly. But not all democratic nations are engaged into this form of defense. That is why Ukraine, being on the road to NATO, is developing a system of security guarantees. And I thank those of you who joined us in this process. Geopolitical stability is the basic element for all other forms of stability. Can a nation alone guarantee geopolitical stability for itself? Definitely not. Can the main Alliance existing on our continent, NATO, do this? Yes, but only if its members know how to be allies. Regional formats of cooperation give this very practice – knowledge of being allies. In one or another area. At one or another historical distance. Knowledge of being allies is not gained easily. It does not come automatically. It is not a consequence of a formal decision to join the Alliance. It is day-to-day cooperation. These are also our coalitions – defense coalitions that help us to stand against Russia. The capabilities of large alliances grow on the basis of meaningful local cooperation. Currently we are working on creating new formats of cooperation and strengthening the existing ones in our region – the Black Sea region. I visited Bucharest, and at the meeting with President Iohannis we agreed that the relations between our states, Ukraine and Romania, deserve the level of strategic partnership. We are also working effectively in the Ukraine-Moldova-Romania triangle. In particular, in logistical cooperation – for the export of food produced in Ukraine, which is critically important for the food security of the world. This also has potential for the energy industry of our countries – for energy independence from Russia. We have a common understanding of security challenges as well. Ukraine has extremely important cooperation with Bulgaria and Türkiye. We all have to remember that joint security and development of the economy, infrastructure in the Black Sea region are some of the keys to the geopolitical stability of entire Europe. New security perspectives will also emerge due to changes in the South Caucasus region neighbouring the Black Sea. This will add potential to our joint security here, in our part of Europe. Especially when thanks to our defense from Russian aggression, new prospects will open for Georgia – to restore its territorial integrity. All of us are now at a historical turning point. We have only two options. Either terrorist Russia will succeed in breaking freedom. And then the zone of geopolitical instability, which exists in the east of Europe, will spread throughout the continent. Or thanks to many levels and formats of cooperation, in particular regional ones, thanks to our common protection of freedom – Russia will lose in this confrontation. After it has lost, and as a result, a historic chance for geopolitical stability along the entire line from Scandinavia through Minsk and Kyiv to the South Caucasus will be realized. Did previous generations have such a chance? Honestly, they didn’t have. Because Russia has always kept the potential for destabilization. But now – we have it. And we have to use it. I am sure we will. Dear leaders! Now, before winter comes, we should all focus firstly on hybrid terrorist threats from Russia. We saw last year what the Kremlin was betting on, namely strikes on the energy infrastructure to destroy the basis of modern life. We predict that this winter Russia will try to repeat its terror tactics, only on a larger scale. It is important now to be ready for any terrorist attacks, for any Russian actions. We must stand this battle. Air defense, namely the defence of our cities, our energy infrastructure and export corridors in the Black Sea, is the key to winning the winter battle for Ukraine. And I thank those of you who have helped all of us to protect our skies against Russian missiles, drones and against Russian jets. The Kremlin must begin to get used to its losses, and the loss of the second winter, the loss of its energy terror will definitely give strength to all of us – it will be easier to lead Russia with losses in the future. But for this we still need to work together – much more! – at the global level, at the regional levels, and in bilateral, of course, format. So that after this winter, we will be able to record – on the basis of our cooperation, of our common efforts, our joint victory is gradually growing and, thanks to it, the establishment of geopolitical stability in the entire Great East of Europe is approaching – real, reliable one. And it will be so. Thank you for your support, invitation, thanks for everything! Слава Україні!",CREDIBLE

These attacks have caused a large number of civilian casualties, with dozens killed and many more injured. Okhmatdyt, the largest children’s hospital in Ukraine, was directly hit by a missile. A maternity hospital was later damaged too. Multiple residential buildings and several substations of the main energy company were completely destroyed. By targeting Okhmatdyt, a symbol of Ukraine’s childcare medicine and treatment of children cancer, and attacking children, who are the most vulnerable, Russia once again demonstrates its cruelty and that it is utterly insincere about peace and peace negotiations. Under international humanitarian law, hospitals enjoy special protection. Children are never and can never be a legitimate target; they must be protected at all times. For the past two and a half years Russia has been continuously terrorising Ukraine’s population by waging its illegal war of aggression, intentionally targeting innocent civilians and civilian infrastructure massively across Ukraine’s territory, with large scale missiles and drone attacks, increasingly using glide bombs. Deliberate attacks on civilians and civil objects which do not constitute a military objective may constitute war crimes and may amount to crimes against humanity. These and other war crimes are subject of international investigations, including at the ICC.

After election officials declared President Nicolás Maduro the winner over opposition candidate Edmundo González, violence erupted in some parts of the capital, Caracas, where protesters threw Molotov cocktails and stones at riot gear-clad national police officers. A man fired a gun as protesters moved through the city’s financial district, The Associated Press reported, although no one suffered a gunshot wound. As concerns over the legitimacy of the election persisted, the United States and several other nations held off from recognizing the results, which were announced at a news conference on Venezuelan state television. With 80% of the ballots counted and a 59% voter turnout, Maduro won a third term with a little more than half of the votes (51%), while González obtained 44% of the votes, according to a preliminary report from Elvis Amoroso, head of the National Electoral Council, which is controlled by the Maduro government. These results were announced as election officials delayed the release of detailed vote tallies from the 30,000 voting booths nationwide, a process crucial to accurate verification. Reports of widespread voter intimidation, irregularities at voting centers and election fraud allegations also prevailed on the day of the election, according to The Associated Press and Reuters. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington had “serious concerns” that the publicized election results did not reflect the votes of the people. Citing independent exit polls, opposition leader María Corina Machado claimed González won 70% of the votes. González had replaced Machado as the opposition’s presidential candidate after the Maduro regime in January banned her from holding office based on fraud and corruption allegations she has denied. She has been the driving force behind the opposition movement. “Venezuelans and the entire world know what happened,” González said. “We won’t rest until the will of the people of Venezuela is respected.” Maduro’s government has relied on fabricated election results in the past. The U.S. government considers his 2018 re-election to have been fraudulent and has said that Venezuela has not had a democratic election since 2015. Argentine President Javier Milei called the official election result a fraud, and leaders in Costa Rica and Peru rejected it. Chilean President Gabriel Boric said the results were “difficult to believe,” adding he would not accept any result that was not verifiable. Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares echoed Boric’s sentiment, saying details from all polling stations should be revealed to guarantee fully verifiable results. The Carter Center, a nongovernmental organization based in Atlanta, is also urging Venezuela’s National Election Commission “to immediately publish the presidential election results at the polling station level.” In a statement, the Carter Center said it was invited by the election commission to observe the presidential election, adding that the unreleased information “is critical to our assessment.” Russia, Cuba, Honduras and Bolivia have accepted Maduro as the winner. The leaders of Brazil and Colombia, which have recently worked to restore ties with Venezuela, praised the overall “peaceful nature of yesterday’s election” and called for a “total vote count, its verification and independent audit to be carried out as soon as possible.” Sunday’s election was among Venezuela’s least violent in recent memory. Maduro had threatened a “bloodbath” if he was not re-elected. Under his leadership, he provided continuity to the single-party rule of the Chavista regime, the socialist-inspired political movement that began nearly three decades ago and turned authoritarian under Maduro’s mentor, Hugo Chávez. Venezuela is home to the world’s largest oil reserves. Financial mismanagement of this sector during Maduro’s term, compounded by strict sanctions imposed by the U.S. in 2019, triggered a domino effect that resulted in the collapse of Venezuela’s economy. It also created an ongoing humanitarian crisis that has left people without access to food, health care and other basic necessities. The crisis has pushed more than 80% of its people into poverty and an estimated 8 million Venezuelans to migrate to other Latin American nations and the U.S., creating the largest displacement crisis in the world. Against this background, support for Maduro and the Chavista regime began to dwindle. The opposition movement then started to gain momentum as its efforts began to cut through ingrained political apathy stemming from years of repression by a government known for arresting dissidents and suppressing protests. On Monday afternoon, Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek William Saab said in a statement that his office is investigating an attempted hack of the electoral commission’s data transmission system. Saab singled out Machado and two other opposition leaders as “allegedly the main people responsible for the attack,” without providing evidence. It remains unclear what the opposition’s next steps will be, but González said it is not calling for supporters to take to the streets or commit any acts of violence. “We are a civic, peaceful movement, and that’s how we will keep working until we make the truth prevail,” Machado said, adding that the opposition has great support from the international community. Discontent over Maduro’s proclaimed victory motivated a few thousand Venezuelans to start marching on the streets of Caracas on Monday afternoon. Protesters on motorbikes were seen removing campaign banners still displayed across the city, and a few tires were burned on the streets. Many of the protesters banged pots and pans and chanted “libertad,” the Spanish word for “freedom,” while holding up Venezuelan flags.",CREDIBLE

Numerous events, such as shelling, air attacks, difficulties with staffing levels and working conditions and losses of off-site power supply, impacted nuclear safety and security on-site. Two nuclear facilities have come under the control of Russian armed forces: the Chornobyl nuclear power plant site, between 24 February and 31 March 2022, and the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant on 4 March 2022, which currently remains under Russian Federation control. The IAEA promptly took steps to help stabilize the critical nuclear safety and security situation and prevent a nuclear accident in Ukraine. Nuclear Safety, Security and Safeguards in Ukraine “ The IAEA remains fully focused on helping to prevent a nuclear accident during this devastating war. The IAEA has been closely monitoring and assessing the situation in Ukraine on a daily basis, prioritizing nuclear safety and security implications, alongside ongoing verification activities. Through issuing regular updates and reports, the Agency consistently shares objective and impartial information with its Member States, the public and the international community. The IAEA has developed and implemented a comprehensive programme of assistance to address requests from Ukrainian authorities to support Ukraine in maintaining continued nuclear safety and security, including through the continued presence of Agency staff at all five Ukrainian nuclear power plant sites. Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi has frequently travelled to Ukraine to lead IAEA missions to assess the situation and conduct high-level talks. The Seven Indispensable Pillars In March 2022, the IAEA developed the ‘Seven Indispensable Pillars ’ to tailor the assessment of the nuclear safety and security situation in Ukraine to the context of the ongoing armed conflict, providing an efficient way to assess the most pressing and important aspects that need to be maintained for the safe and secure operation of the nuclear facilities in Ukraine. Aligned with the IAEA safety standards and nuclear security guidance, the Seven Indispensable Pillars are: The Five Concrete Principles Since the beginning of the armed conflict in Ukraine, the situation at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant (ZNPP) has been very precarious, prompting extensive measures to protect the plant and avoid a nuclear accident.

The attack took place after an off-site government meeting in the central Slovak town of Handlova. The suspected gunman was among a small crowd of people waiting to greet the prime minister on the street outside the cultural center, where the meeting took place, local media reported. Footage from the scene shows the gunman approaching Fico and firing at him from close range across a security barrier. The injured prime minister is then seen being bundled into a vehicle by his staff, before it speeds away with him inside. Fico was taken to a local hospital and then transferred by helicopter to a major trauma center about 20 miles (30 kilometers) away in Banska Bystrica. No one else was injured in the attack, officials said. Both the country’s Defense Minister Robert Kaliňák and Interior Minister Matúš Šutaj Eštok called the shooting “politically motivated,” with Šutaj Eštok saying that “the suspect made the decision to do it shortly after the presidential election.” In an emotional news conference outside the hospital, the two ministers said Fico was “fighting for his life” after the shooting and had been, at that point, in surgery for three and half hours. Later in the evening, Slovakian deputy Prime Minister Tomáš Taraba said he believed the prime minister would survive following surgery that “went well” and was “not in a life-threatening situation at this moment.” “I was very shocked and tried to contact people to figure out how serious his condition was,” Taraba said in an interview with BBC’s Newshour program on Wednesday, recalling the moment he heard about Fico’s shooting. “Fortunately, as far as I know the operation went well and I guess in the end he will survive,” he said. Taraba told the BBC that Fico “was heavily injured” and a bullet “went through the stomach and the second one hit the joints.” Fico is the most powerful lawmaker in Slovakia. Unlike the president, whose role has limited scope, the prime minister holds rank as the decision-making head of government. The official statement posted on Fico’s official Facebook said the PM was taken to Banska Bystrica instead of the capital city of Bratislava because “an acute intervention” was necessary. Handlova is about two hours’ drive from the capital Bratislava. Slovak President Zuzana Čaputová said the suspected gunman was detained by the police. She said law enforcement agencies will release more information when they can and asked the public not to spread unconfirmed rumors. Čaputová condemned what she called a “brutal and reckless” attack on the 59-year-old politician. Speaking at a news conference later in the afternoon, she said the shooting was “an attack on democracy as well.” Slovakia’s defense and interior ministers blamed rising hate speech and division for the political atmosphere in the country, which they said led to the assassination attempt. Speaking to reporters in front of the hospital where Fico is being treated, Defense Minister Kaliňák said: “Hate is not an answer to hate.” Visibly shaken and struggling for words at multiple moments during the news conference, Kaliňák said it was “time for some people to have a hard look into the mirror.” “There is no question that this was politically motivated. The inability to accept the choice of people, which some may not like … it leads to this,” he said. Interior Minister Šutaj-Eštok called for calm, saying “those who are endorsing this attack as well as those who are calling for some sort of a revenge. And I am asking you, the media too, please, use your power, your influence. Because until now, it was some of you who sow the hate,” he said. Following the shooting, Šutaj-Eštok said the country is “experiencing the worst day of its democracy.” “For the first time in the 31 years of our democratic sovereign republic, someone has decided to express a political opinion not in an election but with a gun on the street,” he wrote on Facebook. Slovaks have been deeply divided over the country’s direction and position in the world since Fico’s return to power last year. Supporters see Fico as a caring leader who has their interests at heart; critics say he is a populist whose pro-Russian leanings pose major risks for the country. The country has seen weeks of largely peaceful protests over his coalition government’s controversial domestic reforms. The government is also trying to shut down public service broadcaster RTVS and plans to replace it with a new national broadcaster, which would be under tighter control of the government. Felt like a ‘nightmare’ Social media footage appeared to show the moment Fico was attacked. As he approaches a crowd of people, a man is seen lunging towards Fico with what appears to be a gun pointed at him. Five shots are heard and Fico falls to the ground. An eyewitness who was at the scene where Fico was shot said the attack felt like a “nightmare” after hearing three “quick” shots, fired one after the other as if you were to “throw a firecracker on the ground.” “I heard three shots, it was quick one by one like if you throw a firecracker on the ground,” eyewitness Lubica Valkova told Reuters, adding that “he (Fico) fell next to the barrier.” “I think it is a nightmare, I’ll tell you I think I will not wake up from this,” the 66-year-old said. “That this is not possible to happen in Slovakia.” Valkova said she had been waiting a long time to shake Fico’s hand and was taking pictures of him when he walked out of the building in Handlova. “At this moment we heard something like a bang, we thought someone made a joke and threw a firecracker on the ground, that was my first reaction,” Valkova recalled. The Slovak resident told Reuters she had been waiting from 10 a.m. local time. She claimed police did not search people who were waiting at the event, adding that “we could have shown our empty hands.” Ally of Moscow In what was a stunning comeback for the controversial politician, Fico won a third term as Slovakian prime minister last October after running a campaign that criticized western support for Ukraine. As prime minister, he made a major U-turn in Slovakia’s foreign policy and its previously staunch support for Ukraine: Fico had pledged an immediate end to Slovak military support for Ukraine and promised to block Ukraine’s NATO ambitions. Ahead of the election, Fico made no secret of his sympathies towards the Kremlin and blamed “Ukrainian Nazis and fascists” for provoking Vladimir Putin into launching the invasion, repeating the false narrative Russia’s president has used to justify his invasion. While in opposition, Fico became a close ally of Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, especially when it came to criticism of the European Union. Domestically, his coalition government is also pushing controversial reforms that have prompted weeks of large-scale peaceful protests. Attempts to overhaul the criminal justice system have been particularly controversial, as the government seeks to reduce penalties for corruption and has already abolished Slovakia’s special prosecutor’s office, which was tasked with investigating serious and politically sensitive corruption cases, including some that involved people connected to Fico and his party SMER (“Direction – Social Democracy”). Fico previously served as Slovakia’s prime minister for more than a decade, first between 2006 and 2010 and then again from 2012 to 2018. He was forced to resign in March 2018 after weeks of mass protests over the murder of investigative journalist Jan Kuciak and his fiancée, Martina Kušnírová. Kuciak reported on corruption among the country’s elite, including people directly connected to Fico and his party SMER. World leaders immediately condemned the attack. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a telegram to Slovakia’s president that “there can be no justification for this monstrous crime” and wished Fico a speedy and complete recovery. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, tweeted: “I strongly condemn the vile attack on Prime Minister Robert Fico. Such acts of violence have no place in our society and undermine democracy, our most precious common good.” And Hungarian Prime Minister Orban added: “I was deeply shocked by the heinous attack against my friend, Prime Minister Robert Fico. We pray for his health and quick recovery!” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed “solidarity with the people of Slovakia” following the “appalling” assault on Fico. US President Joe Biden said he was “alarmed” by the attempted assassination of Fico, calling it a “horrific act of violence.” “Jill and I are praying for a swift recovery, and our thoughts are with his family and the people of Slovakia,” he said in a statement. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said he “strongly condemns the shocking attack.” This story has been updated with additional developments.

Welcome back to World Brief, where we’re looking at the alleged suspects involved in Russia’s terrorist attack, a successful United Nations vote on Gaza, and “aggressive actions” in the South China Sea. Investigating Moscow’s Terrorist Attack Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a national day of mourning on Sunday and pledged to punish all those responsible for the terrorist attack last Friday that killed at least 139 people and injured nearly 180 others at a concert at Crocus City Hall in Moscow. Authorities have detained 11 suspects thus far, including four Tajik nationals charged on Sunday with committing an act of terrorism. If found guilty, they face the maximum sentence of life in prison—although former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, among others, have called for Putin to reinstate the death penalty. On Monday, Russian authorities identified three additional people that they allege were involved. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for last Friday’s attack and released video footage of the attack purportedly taken by one of the perpetrators. Putin, however, suggested that Kyiv was involved in the assault, saying the four charged suspects were allegedly apprehended while on a highway leading to Ukraine. “[A] window was prepared for them on the Ukrainian side to cross the state border,” Putin said. Kyiv denied any involvement in the attack, and both the United States and France said the Islamic State was solely responsible. It is “cynical and counterproductive for Russia and her citizens” to try to blame Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron said. According to the White House, the United States shared information with Russia earlier this month warning of a planned attack in Moscow. On March 7, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow also issued a public advisory for all U.S. nationals to avoid crowded spaces in the capital city, including concerts. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov refused to comment on the Islamic State’s involvement or whether Washington provided Russia with prior intelligence, arguing that it was sensitive information and that Russia does not comment on ongoing investigations. Some regional experts believe last Friday’s attack may threaten Putin’s public image, considering it was the deadliest assault in Russia since the 2004 Beslan school siege, when Islamist militants took more than 1,000 people hostage and eventually killed 300, more than half of whom were children. Yet Putin’s hold on power reportedly remains strong. Last week, he was reelected to another six-year term in largely predetermined elections mere weeks after opposition leader Alexei Navalny died while imprisoned at a Siberian penal colony. And Russia continued its assault on Kyiv over the weekend with renewed missile and drone attacks—one of which violated Polish airspace for 39 seconds while en route to targets in western Ukraine.

The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution on Monday calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which began on March 10. The resolution also demands the “immediate and unconditional” release of hostages held in Gaza and the delivery of humanitarian aid to the region. The council’s 10 nonpermanent members drafted the text, and 14 nations voted to approve the resolution. The United States abstained. “Finally, finally, the Security Council is shouldering its responsibility,” said Amar Bendjama, Algeria’s ambassador to the U.N. This was the council’s sixth attempt at passing a resolution calling for a halt in fighting since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023. The United States vetoed three resolutions, and China and Russia vetoed two drafts, the most recent occurring last Friday. Attempts to amend the text by restoring earlier language that included the word “permanent” failed. Security Council resolutions are legally binding but lack an enforcement mechanism, though Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., referred to the text as a “nonbinding resolution.” Other Biden administration officials have also referred to it as nonbinding, a position that is inconsistent with what other countries and international legal experts have said. In response to the vote, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu canceled plans to send a delegation to Washington this week to discuss Israel’s much-criticized impending military offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. The United States’ decision not to veto the resolution will hurt war efforts, Netanyahu argued, by giving “Hamas hope that international pressure will enable them to achieve a cease-fire without freeing the hostages.” The White House denied that the abstention signaled a shift in policy. South China Sea spat. The Philippines’ foreign ministry summoned China’s charge d’affaires to Manila on Monday to protest “aggressive actions” in the South China Sea. It accused Beijing’s coast guard of firing a water cannon on Saturday at a civilian ship in the Second Thomas Shoal that was delivering supplies to Philippine troops. “China’s continued interference with the Philippines’ routine and lawful activities in its own exclusive economic zone (EEZ) is unacceptable,” it said. The Chinese Embassy in Manila accused the Philippines of “intruding” into Chinese waters, reiterated its claim over the maritime territory, and warned the Philippines on Monday against “playing with fire.” This was Beijing’s second such warning in three months, and it follows U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s trip to Manila last week, when he reaffirmed Washington’s “ironclad commitment” to defend the Philippines in the South China Sea. Rescue missions. Nigerian authorities on Sunday rescued 137 schoolchildren who had been kidnapped from the state of Kaduna earlier this month. They were recovered just days before a roughly $690,000 ransom deadline was set to expire, which Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu said he refused to pay. No group has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping, and around 150 people are believed to still be missing. In Mexico, state officials also celebrated a successful rescue mission over the weekend when authorities found 42 hostages, including 18 children, kidnapped by criminal groups in the state of Sinaloa on Friday. Twenty-four people remain missing. The territory is home to the infamous Sinaloa cartel, though police have not yet confirmed who was behind the kidnappings. Odds and Ends If customer service was a little slow in Paris’s cafes last weekend, don’t blame the waitstaff. They might have been participating in France’s annual waiters’ race. Around 200 servers speed-walked a 1.2-mile trek without dropping their platters, each one carrying a croissant, a glass of water, and a cup of coffee. First held in the early 1900s, the waiters’ race returned on Sunday after a 12-year hiatus to promote Paris hosting the 2024 Summer Olympics in July.

Russia’s war against Ukraine did not begin on Feb. 24, 2022, but in 2014, with both the annexation of Crimea and the invasion of Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. While the Kremlin openly boasted of its annexation of the Crimean peninsula, it tried to conceal its involvement in the war in Donbas for years. Moscow instead spread the false narrative that self-organized “separatist” groups in eastern Ukraine were responsible for the aggression, despite no evidence to suggest that a genuine separatist movement existed in eastern Ukraine at the time. Many politicians, experts, and journalists around the world have played into Russian propaganda, framing the war in Donbas as a civil war. Russian military formations were often referred to as Ukrainian “separatists,” despite the documented presence of Russian military personnel and weapons in Ukraine. The West’s condemnation went as far as limited sanctions, which did little to stop Russia’s war. Ukraine was left alone to fight a war that killed thousands, plunged once-prosperous regions into chaos and poverty, and displaced over a million Ukrainians. For the Kremlin, the incursion into Ukrainian territory was an attempt to impede Ukraine’s democratic, pro-Western course, and a precursor of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. How did Russia invade and occupy parts of Donbas? Just over a month before Russian military groups invaded Donbas in April 2014, the Ukrainian people successfully ousted Kremlin-backed president Viktor Yanukovych during the EuroMaidan Revolution. The Kremlin capitalized on the post-revolutionary chaos and sent its troops into the Crimean peninsula days after the revolution succeeded in February 2014. They immediately took the peninsula under control, and proclaimed its annexation in March 2014. Throughout March and April, demonstrations against the pro-Western revolution and in support of Russia began appearing in the east and south of Ukraine. Protestors demanded to hold local referendums on joining Russia – unconstitutional in Ukraine – among other pro-Russian demands. The demonstrations were small, numbering generally in the hundreds of people. Ukrainian authorities have gathered evidence that these demonstrations were organized by Russian citizens who collaborated with Kremlin-linked politicians in Ukraine. Sergey Glazyev, former advisor to Russian President Vladimir Putin, was tasked with organizing pro-Russian protests in Zaporizhzhia, Crimea, and Odesa, according to Ukrainian law enforcement findings in 2016. There were even reports of buses bringing crowds of Russian nationals to take part in the rallies. Around the same time, armed men without insignia also managed to take over government buildings in the regional capitals of Donetsk and Luhansk, but didn’t immediately take full control of the two regional capitals. The occupation of cities in Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts came in phases. While armed men infiltrated or took over government buildings in cities across the two oblasts in March and April, militants led by former Russian FSB officer Igor Girkin moved to formally occupy Sloviansk on April 12 immediately followed by Kramatorsk, cities north of Donetsk. They were later kicked out by Ukrainian troops in July, moving to the regional capital of Donetsk, where they faced little resistance from the local or national forces. In an interview to a Russian media outlet in 2014, Girkin openly claimed responsibility for helping to ignite the war in Donbas and confirmed the presence of the Russian military and weapons on Ukrainian territory. He has repeated these claims. On May 11, 2014 militias coordinated by Russia proclaimed a sham referendum on the independence of what they refer to as the “Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics,” the name given to the Russian occupied, proxy-led parts of Ukraine’s Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts. Russian proxies then announced around 90% support for independence in both oblasts. Ukraine and much of the international community have deemed these so-called referendums illegal and illegitimate. How did Ukraine respond to the invasion? In April, the Ukrainian government announced an “anti-terrorist operation,” often referred to in Ukraine as “ATO,” in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. The Ukrainian military and special forces then began engaging in armed clashes with Russian-led units in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine was severely underprepared for the invasion. Decades of corruption had left the military nearly in ruins, while the government still wasn’t fully formed after Yanukovych was toppled in February. Moreover, when the invasion started, Ukraine didn’t have a president. Parliament’s chairman Oleksandr Turchynov temporarily assumed the presidency after the revolution. Petro Poroshenko was elected president in late May, as battles in Donbas were already underway. Over the summer of 2014, a Ukrainian counteroffensive into the areas around Sloviansk and Kramatorsk liberated big swaths of land, forcing Russian-backed forces to flee south-east to Donetsk. What were the Minsk agreements? The first peace plan to try to stop the fighting, the Minsk Protocol, was signed in September 2014. Just a month prior, more than 350 Ukrainian soldiers were killed in the Battle of Ilovaisk when Russian forces massacred Ukrainian fighters that were retreating through an agreed-upon corridor. Ukraine, Russia, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) agreed on a 12-point ceasefire deal, with OSCE playing a monitoring role. Germany and France mediated the talks. The protocol failed. Russia broke the ceasefire almost immediately, eventually reigniting the fight for the Donetsk Airport – one of the bloodiest and memorialized battles of Russia’s war in Donbas. Ukrainian forces also suffered huge losses in the Battle of Debaltseve the following winter. A revised version of the protocol, Minsk II, was signed in 2015, but it also failed to stop the war for all the same reasons. Russia again breached the ceasefire and didn’t move back its heavy weapons, as was required. Highly contentious provisions of the Minsk agreements included amnesty for all those involved in the fighting, decentralization in Ukraine to give more power to local authorities in Donbas, as well as local elections in Ukraine’s eastern territories. Many believe that the agreements were null from the very beginning. Ukraine was already under attack by an outnumbered enemy, with no help from the West, and was thus pressured to sign even ill-advised deals to prevent further destruction. Although the front line remained static after 2015, crossfire battles continued killing soldiers and civilians for the next seven years. Why did Russia invade? Russia’s invasions of Crimea and Donbas are seen by many as a reaction to Ukraine’s pro-Western course. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine was re-establishing itself as an independent, democratic state after decades of communist rule. In 2004-2005, Ukraine’s Orange Revolution led to an overturning of presidential election results after people took to the streets to protest against election fraud. The candidate accused of rigging the election was no other than Kremlin-backed Viktor Yanukovych, later elected in 2010 and toppled in 2014 during the EuroMaidan Revolution – followed by the annexation of Crimea and war in Donbas. Ukrainian society, slowly but surely, was coalescing around democratic ideals. Civil society grew larger and louder. Meanwhile, Putin’s Russia was moving towards authoritarianism and wished to keep Ukraine under its influence. The Kremlin never truly accepted the independence of Ukrainian land, culture, and history. Ukraine’s rejection of Russian superiority and pro-European course, as well as the risk of spilling revolutionary ideals across the border, was seen as a catastrophe in the Kremlin. The invasion of Donbas and Crimea is seen by many as an attempt to force Ukraine to give up its Western aspirations. Is the war in Donbas a civil war? The war in Donbas is not a civil war, as it was instigated and coordinated by Russia. Although the Kremlin consistently framed the war as an internal Ukrainian struggle, international organizations and journalists have found direct proof of Russia’s involvement. From the pre-war spread of secessionist sentiments to the fighting itself, all forces that fought against the Ukrainian government were fully or in part coordinated and financed by the Kremlin – and some simply were Russian, including the regular Russian army. For instance, Bellingcat has documented Russian artillery attacks and Russian military vehicles in Donbas. Amnesty International said in 2014 that there was “evidence that the fighting has burgeoned into what Amnesty International now considers an international armed conflict.” An extensive report on Russia’s involvement by the D.C.-based think tank Atlantic Council also discusses the Russian army fighting in Donbas, supplying militias, and otherwise supporting the war. The European Court of Human Rights said in a ruling that “areas in eastern Ukraine in separatist hands were, from May 11, 2014 and up to at least Jan. 26, 2022, under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation.” And in 2021, Russia was even caught admitting to stationing units of the Russian Armed Forces on Ukraine’s occupied territories in court documents. What has been the cost of Russia’s invasion of Donbas in 2014? Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts were industrial powerhouses before Russia’s invasion, with dozens of metallurgical, coal, chemical, and mechanical engineering enterprises that exported products all around the world. The region brought around 15.7% of Ukraine’s GDP, and 14.7% of Ukraine’s population lived there, according to the London-based consulting firm Centre for Economics and Business Research. The work of many of these enterprises came to a standstill as Russian attacks damaged industrial property, millions of locals fled the hostilities, and blockades between Ukraine and Russian-occupied territories abolished trade. The invasion also led to a fall in Ukraine’s international exports and foreign investment. The Centre for Economics and Business Research found that Ukraine suffered a total of $102 billion in losses from Russia’s war in Donbas from 2014 to 2021. This means that annually, Ukraine was losing around 8% of its pre-war GDP just due to Russia’s invasion of Donbas. At least two million people were forced to flee their homes because of the fighting. And roughly the same amount of people continued to live under Russian occupation – amid complete poverty, Kremlin indoctrination, and crossfire along the front, as Ukraine fought off continuous Russian attacks. Thousands of Ukrainians were held hostage in Russian-occupied territories, including civilians. They were reportedly beaten, tortured, and held in prisons that many described as concentration camps. At least 3,900 civilians and 4,200 soldiers died in Donbas as of February 2021, according to the U.N. Almost 20,000 civilians and soldiers were injured.",CREDIBLE

Russian neighbor and ally Belarus said it is boosting its military presence along its border with Ukraine, with its president saying its troops are combat-ready. Aleksander Lukashenko called Ukraine an ""enemy"" in a recent speech and said his soldiers along Ukraine's border have a ""high combat readiness,"" according to a translation of his remarks by Ukrainian outlet Euromaidan. He also said Belarus has increased the number of its troops and missile systems. ""Special operations forces have been deployed, including not only border guards but also our military personnel. As the border guards report, they have now blocked the likely direction of enemy movement,"" Lukashenko said, per Euromaidan. He added: ""Air force and air defense troops are on high alert — both ours and Russian forces, with full coordination between them."" Belarus, which borders both Ukraine and Russia, is seen as loyal to Russia and something of a Russian puppet state. Lukashenko has been in power since 1994 and is close to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The country has not been directly involved in Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but it has aided Russia's efforts since it began in February 2022. Thousands of Russian troops entered Ukraine from Belarus at the start of the invasion. Russia also launched ballistic missiles into Ukraine from Belarusian territory, and Russian bomber aircraft launched missiles at Ukraine from Belarus' air space. Russia has also stationed tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus since the full-scale invasion began. Lukashenko's comments suggest that he's worried about Ukrainian troops getting closer to his border, something other Belarusian officials have also expressed concerns about. This includes a high-ranking Belarusian military official saying in late June that Ukraine was ""attempting to drag our country into the war."" In response, Ukraine's State Border Guard Service said that all of Ukraine's activities near Belarus' border were just defensive, Euromaidan reported. Ukraine has painted Belarus' statements as part of a disinformation operation. In May, Ukrainian officials said that Russia may carry out a psychological operation aimed at ""stirring up mass panic"" in Ukraine by making people believe Belarus' troops would join the fighting. ""We expect a series of provocative statements by the top leadership of Russia and Belarus threatening Ukraine soon,"" the Ukrainian Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation said. There have been no signs that Ukraine would send any troops into Belarus, and it's something that would likely be met with a strong Russian response. There is also no indication as yet that Lukashenko is considering sending troops into Ukraine. He said last year that his soldiers would join the war if Ukrainian soldiers entered Belarus. It is unlikely that Belarus' troops would make a big impact even if they did enter the war. Mark Cancian, a retired US Marine Corps colonel and defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Business Insider in 2022 that ""the Belarusian armed forces are small and weak."" He said Belarus' military would get ""eaten alive"" if it invaded Ukraine and said ""the Belarusians have been very careful not to get their own troops involved."" The UK Ministry of Defence also said in March 2023 that Belarus' army is much less experienced than Russia's military.",CREDIBLE

Secretly Helps Ukraine Fight Putin For more than a decade, the United States has nurtured a secret intelligence partnership with Ukraine that is now critical for both countries in countering Russia. A Ukrainian Army soldier in a forest near Russian lines this month. A C.I.A.-supported network of spy bases has been constructed in the past eight years that includes 12 secret locations along the Russian border.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York Times Adam Entous and Michael Schwirtz conducted more than 200 interviews in Ukraine, several other European countries and the United States to report this story. Nestled in a dense forest, the Ukrainian military base appears abandoned and destroyed, its command center a burned-out husk, a casualty of a Russian missile barrage early in the war. But that is above ground. Not far away, a discreet passageway descends to a subterranean bunker where teams of Ukrainian soldiers track Russian spy satellites and eavesdrop on conversations between Russian commanders. On one screen, a red line followed the route of an explosive drone threading through Russian air defenses from a point in central Ukraine to a target in the Russian city of Rostov. The underground bunker, built to replace the destroyed command center in the months after Russia’s invasion, is a secret nerve center of Ukraine’s military. Adam Entous is a Washington-based investigative correspondent and a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner. Before joining the Washington bureau of The Times, he covered intelligence, national security and foreign policy for The New Yorker magazine, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal.More about Adam Entous Michael Schwirtz is an investigative reporter with the International desk.

An expert on jihadist groups says the ""attack, the type of people involved, the style of the attack and the media campaign"" is all ""Islamic State modus operandi"". Tuesday 26 March 2024 21:32, UK An expert has told Sky News the attack on a Moscow concert hall is consistent with Islamic State. Sky News has analysed IS footage of the attack and an image released by the militant group and spoken to experts about what the materials reveal. Aaron Zelin, an expert on jihadist groups and senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said ""the attack itself, the type of people involved, the style of the attack and the media campaign"" is all ""Islamic State modus operandi"". IS has said it carried out the shooting massacre, and US officials have said their intelligence indicates that an Afghan affiliate, Islamic State Khorasan, or IS-K, was responsible. However, Vladimir Putin has not publicly mentioned IS in connection with the assailants. The video A day after the attack, IS released a video of the assailants inside Crocus Hall via the militant group's Amaq news agency which shows a number of gunmen storming the building and attacking people. The attackers are seen holding guns and also knives. More than 130 people were killed and over 180 others were injured on Friday night. Mr Zelin said the type of weapons used in the attack are consistent with IS methods. ""We've seen in past attacks they shoot people and stab people... They have as many weapons on them as possible so they can inflict as much damage on them as possible. ""So, if they end up using all their bullets and cartridges or AK-47s they will still have a knife to stab."" While IS has also used other methods in previous attacks, including suicide attacks, another expert said that it would likely be easier to ""procure firearms in Russia"". Dr Antonio Giustozzi, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said the way IS carries out attacks ""depends on the kind of weapons they can obtain"". ""So explosives, especially plastic explosives that you can use for suicide belts is not so easy to procure.... It's probably easier to procure firearms in Russia."" He added the ""exact choice of weapons can be dictated by what's available on the black market"". Clothing worn by suspects match IS image IS also released an earlier image which they say shows some of the people behind the Moscow attack. It shows four people with blurred faces in front of an IS flag. Mr Zelin said images ""pledging allegiance to the leader of IS"" are part of the group's media campaign. Sky News has analysed and compared the IS image to subsequent interrogation videos and images by Russian authorities and other photos later taken of the four suspects in court. We used a facial recognition tool and analysed the clothing worn by the suspects. Clothing worn by three of the people seen in the IS image matches those seen in other videos and images appearing in the aftermath of the attack. We brightened the IS image above and matched details on the T-shirts worn by three of the people - to other images and videos on Telegram showing them being interrogated by Russian authorities. The detailing of a logo on a T-shirt worn by one of the suspects in the image below appears blurred in the IS image (left), visible from a screenshot of the IS video (centre) and again on the T-shirt in an aftermath video (right). The suspects have been named as Dalerdzhon Mirzoyev, Saidakrami Murodali Rachabalizoda, Muhammadsobir Fayzov and Shamsidin Fariduni. We cross referenced the aftermath imagery and videos to photos of the four suspects pictured in court using an AI facial recognition tool which confirmed they matched. Mr Zelin said that while not all IS attacks are the same, there is a consistency to the group's media campaign. He explained they often include a line to first claim responsibility, followed by a longer statement, then ""photographic evidence of the individuals pledging allegiance to the leader of IS"", followed by some form of video of the attack or to do with the attack. ""It's definitely a template they use, part of it is to keep them in the news for a longer time,"" he added. Claiming responsibility for attack Experts are convinced no other group is responsible. Dr Giustozzi said: ""This is about, intimidating, spreading terror and primarily the recruitment and funding for the militant group."" Mr Zelin said in the aftermath of attack, he had seen in their ""different types of propaganda in a number of different languages that they are trying to recruit people"". Russia's president Vladimir Putin has not publicly mentioned Islamic State in connection with the assailants, who he said had been trying to flee to Ukraine with help from ""the Ukrainian side"". Ukraine has denied any role and Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Putin of seeking to divert blame. Washington said it had warned Russia this month of an imminent attack. A source familiar with this intelligence said it was based on interceptions of ""chatter"" among IS-K militants.",CREDIBLE

Close transatlantic coordination remains just as important as in decades past for maintaining peace and security in Europe and around the world, especially against the backdrop of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. The United States is a crucial partner when it comes to overcoming the social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and addressing global challenges such as climate change and strengthening the multilateral order. The transatlantic security community within the framework of NATO and the approximately 35,200 US troops stationed in Germany help to ensure Europe’s security. Close economic relations, too, create jobs in and foster exchange between the two countries. In 2022 again, the United States was the most important trading partner for Germany and the European Union. German companies are the third largest foreign employer in the US, providing a total of around 923,600 jobs.

Brussels had been considering both applications alongside each other, but last week Olivér Várhelyi, the European commissioner for enlargement, told Euronews that decoupling the bids ""might be an option"" if Bulgaria continues to oppose North Macedonia's entrance in the bloc.

We showed that through the Prespa agreement and with our diplomacy and flexibility. ""Our identity is one and unique and there is no possibility my government or any other government to negotiate for that. And therefore, it's not possible [for] either a state or even a union [of which] we are not still members, to play with that. ""[From my side], it's not possible to have decoupling, or [any other kind] of development or event for practical reasons without a word of North Macedonia after everything that's happened,"" Zaev said in reference to the landmark agreement and the reforms his country has implemented as part of preparations for EU membership. 'We deserve the next step' Zaev believes North Macedonia ""deserves"" to enter the next step of the membership process: the intergovernmental conference. Negotiations to become an EU country are conducted within the framework of a bilateral intergovernmental conference that gathers representatives from member states and the candidate country. The European Commission also participates in these sessions, which focus on how the candidate country will incorporate the entire body of EU law and adapt its domestic regulations. In March 2020, the European Council agreed to open accession talks with both Albania and North Macedonia, thus enabling the creation of the conferences. However, Bulgaria's persistent opposition has so far prevented the diplomatic breakthrough from becoming a reality. ""We expect the EU as a whole, all 27 member countries, the European Commission, to be in the line to what they promised to us. That was: you deliver, we will deliver. We delivered and we have doubled it. And we expect the European Union to deliver,"" said Zaev. ""We are open to discuss any issue [that] is negotiable for everyone. But issues like identities, like languages, are never talked in any step of enlargement of the European Union with any other country. ""It's a huge risk if there is a continuation of the blockage. It’s a risk for Bulgaria also, for North Macedonia, for the whole Balkans,"" he warned. The prime minister believes the prolonged accession bid and its resulting frustration have led to the circulation of an alleged non-paper that advocates redrawing the borders of the Balkan countries formed after the break-up of Yugoslavia. The explosive document, whose existence has not been fully verified, proposes Serbia, Croatia, and Albania being expanded to swallow up parts of neighbouring Bosnia, North Macedonia and Kosovo. ""We are completely, all of us, dedicated to our European Union future. But there is still extreme and radical forces all around inside the Balkans, out of Balkans, who are very much focused and they wait [for the] chance for that kind of unpleasant activities,"" Zaev remarked, adding that similar forces can also jeopardise the Prespa agreement. ""[The Prespa agreement] can be at risk only if there is bitter feelings to the citizens of North Macedonia and the whole region, if more reasons for nationalism and extremism appear, which is present everywhere, especially in the Balkans, and can damage the agreement, but we believe that we have enough strength to protect it.""",CREDIBLE

A migration agreement was also signed during his visit. - Transcript of press conference - Sunday, 15 September 2024 Transcript of the press conference in German only The migration agreement was based on the same pattern as the agreements the Federal Government was seeking to gradually put in place with many countries across the world, said Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz in a statement delivered to the press in Samarkand in Uzbekistan on Sunday. Before signing the agreement, Scholz visited the famous Registan square in Samarkand and spoke to Uzbekistan’s President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in private. The Federal Chancellor reported that they had talked about the development of business relations, as well as the Russian war of aggression. On Monday the Federal Chancellor attended the German-Uzbek business roundtable together with a business delegation from Germany. The most important points from the Federal Chancellor’s press statement: - Migration agreement: The agreement to form a mobility partnership for migration allowed for the “essential immigration of highly gifted workers that we need in Germany,” Federal Chancellor Scholz explained. He added that it also provided for simple, non-bureaucratic procedures “for returning those who must go back”. - Expanding bilateral relations: The conversation with President Mirziyoyev also focussed on plans to deepen bilateral relations, and on how German companies and Uzbekistan’s development goals can complement each other. Uzbekistan has the second biggest national economy in Central Asia and vast mineral resource reserves. - Further topics: Other issues addressed in the conversations included the geographic situation of the country as Afghanistan’s neighbour, development towards democratisation in Uzbekistan and the Russian war of aggression. The Federal Chancellor’s trip to Central Asia: Olaf Scholz is visiting Central Asia for three days from 15 to 17 September. His first stop is Uzbekistan, followed by Kazakhstan. It is his first trip to the region in his role as leader of the government. The trip includes bilateral talks with the heads of state of the five countries that became independent after the collapse of the Soviet Union, that are known as the Z5 (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan). At the “Z5+1” summit on Tuesday, there will also be a multilateral meeting between the group of states and Germany. A strategic regional partnership was established at the first Z5+1 meeting in Berlin last year. Another goal of the Federal Chancellor’s trip is therefore to continue to breathe life into this regional partnership.",CREDIBLE

Each case of Russian interference is special and quite the opposite of routinised practice, as suggested by the mainstream media. When assessing Russian meddling, Shekhovtsov argues that we need to consider the following five factors: – Putin’s regime is not satisfied with the prevailing political attitudes towards Russia in Western Country X. – There are political forces in Country X that are significant enough and are ready to cooperate with Russian pro-Kremlin actors. – Meddling in the elections in favour of particular political forces does not clash with other, non-political interests of Putin’s regime in Country X. – Russia has relevant human and structural resources to interfere in the electoral process in Country X. – Political culture in Country X is conducive to Russian influence. This article discusses elections in France, Norway, Germany, Austria, Italy, Hungary, and Sweden that took place in 2017-2018, and shows how different combinations of the above-mentioned factors produced different outcomes in terms of Russian meddling.

Learn more about vaccines – from how they work and how they’re made to ensuring safety and equitable access – in WHO’s Vaccines Explained series. Countries around the world are rolling out COVID-19 vaccines, and a key topic of interest is their safety. Vaccine safety is one of WHO’s highest priorities, and we’re working closely with national authorities to develop and implement standards to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. Ensuring safety Billions of people have been safely vaccinated against COVID-19. All of the approved COVID-19 vaccines have been carefully tested and continue to be monitored. Like all vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines go through a rigorous, multi-stage testing process, including large clinical trials that involve tens of thousands of people. These trials are specifically designed to identify any safety concerns. An external panel of experts convened by WHO analyses the results from clinical trials and recommends whether and how the vaccines should be used. Officials in individual countries decide whether to approve the vaccines for national use and develop policies for how to use the vaccines based on WHO recommendations. After a COVID-19 vaccine is introduced, WHO supports work with vaccine manufacturers, health officials in each country and other partners to monitor for any safety concerns on an ongoing basis. New vaccine technology Some COVID-19 vaccines have been developed with an approach that uses messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA vaccine technology has been studied for over a decade, including in the development of vaccines for Zika, rabies and influenza. These mRNA vaccines have been rigorously assessed for safety, and clinical trials have shown that they provide a long-lasting immune response. mRNA vaccines are not live virus vaccines and do not interfere with human DNA. For more information on mRNA vaccines, see WHO’s explainer on the different types of COVID-19 vaccines. Safety of COVID-19 vaccines for different groups COVID-19 vaccines have been tested in large, randomized controlled trials that include people of a broad age range, all sexes, different ethnicities, and those with known medical conditions. The vaccines have shown a high level of efficacy across all populations. Vaccines have been found to be safe and effective in people with various underlying medical conditions that are associated with increased risk of severe disease. These include high blood pressure; diabetes; asthma; pulmonary, liver or kidney disease; and chronic infections that are stable and controlled. Those who should consult with a doctor before vaccination include people with a compromised immune system, older people with severe frailty, people with a history of severe allergic reaction to vaccines, people living with HIV, and those who are pregnant or breastfeeding. For more information about vaccine safety for different groups, please see our Q&A on COVID-19 vaccine safety. Pregnancy You can get vaccinated whilst you are pregnant. During pregnancy, you are at higher risk of serious illness caused by COVID-19. You are also at higher risk of delivering your baby prematurely if you contract COVID-19. While there is less data available on vaccination of pregnant people, evidence on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy has been growing, and no safety concerns have been identified. Especially in countries with high transmission, or if you have an occupation where you are at more risk of being exposed to COVID-19, the benefits of getting the vaccine outweigh potential risks. There is no risk of getting COVID-19 from the vaccine. Talk to your healthcare provider to make an informed decision about vaccination. Questions and Answers: COVID-19 vaccines and pregnancy Breastfeeding If you are breastfeeding, you should get vaccinated against COVID-19 as soon as it is your turn. None of the current COVID-19 vaccines have live virus in them. This means there is no risk of you transmitting COVID-19 to your baby through your breastmilk from the vaccine. In fact, the antibodies you get after vaccination may go through your breast milk and help to protect your baby. Safety of COVID-19 vaccines for children The Pfizer vaccine is safe for use in children aged 5 years and above. For children in this age group, WHO recommends a reduced dosage of 10 µg (0.2 ml). Both Pfizer and Moderna are safe for use in children aged 12 and above using a dose of 0.3 ml and 0.5 ml respectively. However, while the availability of COVID-19 vaccines is limited, WHO recommends that countries should vaccinate children only when high vaccine coverage with two doses has been achieved in higher priority-use groups, as identified in the WHO Prioritization Roadmap. However, children with existing health conditions should be prioritised for vaccination at the same time as other high risk groups. Vaccine trials to determine whether other COVID-19 vaccines are safe for use in children are ongoing, and WHO recommendations will be updated when the evidence supports a change in the policy. Practicing the protective behaviours is still the best way to keep everyone, including children, safe from COVID-19, whether or not you have been vaccinated. Keep a safe distance from others, avoid crowds, wear a well-fitting mask covering your mouth and nose, keep indoor spaces well ventilated, clean hands regularly and cover coughs and sneezes, as well as getting vaccinated as soon as it’s your turn. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ This page was updated on 21 January 2022 to reflect updates in the latest guidance relating to the vaccination of children.",CREDIBLE

https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/russian-media-are-oppressed-in-the-baltic-states/,https://rsf.org/en/estonia,2024-07-24,"Although press freedom is guaranteed on the legal and political levels, journalists face the risk of self-censorship due to anti-defamation legislation and cyber-bullying. Media landscape Subject to consolidation over the last decade, the Estonian media market now features two major media houses (Postimees Group and Ekspress Group), public broadcaster ERR, local media, and a number of independent online outlets. Russian-speaking media, including a public TV channel, public and private radio stations, as well as independent websites cater to the Russian-speaking minority that makes up 25% of the population. Political context The political environment has been characterized by a relative neutrality towards journalism and few verbal attacks, which has contributed to journalists being able to hold politicians accountable without fear of persecution. Legal framework Although constitutionally guaranteed, media freedom is constrained by legislation protecting against defamation and disclosure of private data. While the fear of defamation lawsuits may lead to self-censorship, the laws protecting private data have recently become a pretext of Estonian authorities to increasingly restrict media’s access to public information. The ethical framework for journalists is codified by the Association of Media Companies and by most media organizations separately. Economic context Media ownership in Estonia is so concentrated that it can be considered an oligopoly. The owners of the two major media groups also have stakes in other business sectors. Estonian private media are operating within a small market with limited access to funding, which constrains them to looking for new revenue sources such as organizing events. The budget for public broadcasting is increasingly limited and may be subject to political influence. Sociocultural context Although no long-term cultural or societal constraints have prevented journalists from doing their job, the media were accused by a part of the population of complacency with the authorities and pharmaceutical companies during the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, journalists suffered online and offline verbal attacks. Safety While physical attacks against them are extremely rare, journalists have been exposed to a growing number of online threats by private individuals, the most severe cases being reported to the police and investigated. The media houses have deployed measures to better protect journalists, but in the context of lacking systematic psychological assistance, cyberbullying may have a self-censorship effect on journalists.",CREDIBLE

The Black Sea coast was for centuries in the sphere of the contemporary Mediterranean maritime powers. The open steppe, funneling from the east across southern Ukraine and toward the mouth of the Danube River, formed a natural gateway to Europe for successive waves of nomadic horsemen from Central Asia. And the mixed forest-steppe and forest belt of north-central and western Ukraine supported an agricultural population (most notably the Trypillya culture of the mid-5th to 3rd millennia bce), linked by waterways to northern and central Europe. The marshlands of these zones were frequent areas of both military conflict and cultural transmission. Beginning in the 7th–6th centuries bce, numerous Greek colonies were founded on the northern coast of the Black Sea, on the Crimean Peninsula, and along the Sea of Azov; these Hellenic outposts later came under the hegemony of the Roman Empire (see ancient Greek civilization; ancient Rome). During the 1st millennium bce the steppe hinterland was occupied successively by the Cimmerians, Scythians, and Sarmatians. These peoples, all of Iranian stock, maintained commercial and cultural relations with the Greek colonies. A period of great migrations began with the descent of the Goths from the Baltic region into Ukraine about 200 ce. They displaced the Sarmatians, but their own power was broken about 375 by the invading Huns from the east, who were followed in the 5th–6th centuries by the Bulgars and Avars. Between the 7th and 9th centuries, the Ukrainian steppe formed part of the Turkic Khazar mercantile empire, which was centred on the lower Volga River. Khazar control of the steppe was breached in the late 9th century by the Magyars (Hungarians). The Pechenegs, who followed, dominated much of southern Ukraine in the 10th and 11th centuries, and they were in turn succeeded by the Polovtsians (Cumans). Throughout this period of nomadic invasions, only a few of the Greek settlements on the Crimean Peninsula, notably Chersonesus (see Tauric Chersonese), maintained a precarious existence, relying on the support of the Byzantine Empire. In the meantime, under the impact of Germanic migrations, the movement of Slavic tribes from their primordial homeland north of the Carpathians began in the 5th and 6th centuries. While some Slavs migrated westward and others south into the Balkans, the East Slavs occupied the forest and forest-steppe regions of what are now western and north-central Ukraine and southern Belarus; they expanded farther north and to the northeast into territories of the future Russian state centred on Moscow. The East Slavs practiced agriculture and animal husbandry, engaged in such domestic industries as cloth making and ceramics, and built fortified settlements, many of which later developed into important commercial and political centres. Among such early settlements was Kyiv (Kiev), on the high right (western) bank of the Dnieper River. Kyivan (Kievan) Rus The formation of the Kyivan state that began in the mid-9th century, the role of the Varangians (Vikings) in this process, and the name Rus by which this state came to be known are all matters of controversy among historians. It is clear, however, that this formation was connected with developments in international trade and the new prominence of the Dnieper route from the Baltic to Byzantium, on which Kyiv was strategically sited. Trade along this route was controlled by Varangian merchant-warriors, and from their ranks came the progenitors of the Kyivan princes, who were, however, soon Slavicized. In the early chronicles the Varangians were also called Rus, and this corporate name became a territorial designation for the Kyivan region—the basic territory of the Rus; later, by extension, it was applied to the entire territory ruled by members of the Kyivan dynasty. By the end of the 10th century, the Kyivan domain covered a vast area from the edge of the open steppe in Ukraine as far north as Lake Ladoga and the upper Volga basin. Like other medieval states, it did not develop central political institutions but remained a loose aggregation of principalities ruling what was a dynastic clan enterprise. Kyiv reached its apogee in the reigns of Volodymyr the Great (Vladimir I) and his son Yaroslav I (the Wise). In 988 Volodymyr adopted Christianity as the religion of his realm and had the inhabitants of Kyiv baptized. Rus entered the orbit of Byzantine (later, Orthodox) Christianity and culture. A church hierarchy was established, headed (at least since 1037) by the metropolitan of Kyiv, who was usually appointed by the patriarch of Constantinople. With the new religion came new forms of architecture, art, and music, a written language (Old Church Slavonic), and the beginnings of a literary culture. All these were vigorously promoted by Yaroslav, who also promulgated a code of laws, the first in Slavdom. Although Byzantium and the steppe remained his main preoccupations in external policy, Yaroslav maintained friendly relations with European rulers, with whom he established marital alliances for his progeny. Following Yaroslav’s death, Kyiv entered a long period of decline, only briefly stemmed in the 12th century under Volodymyr II Monomakh (Vladimir II Monomakh). Shifts in trade routes undermined Kyiv’s economic importance, while warfare with the Polovtsians in the steppe sapped its wealth and energies. Succession struggles and princely rivalries eroded Kyiv’s political hegemony. The ascendancy of new centres and the clustering of principalities around them reflected regional cleavages—historical, economic, and tribal ethnic—that had persisted even in the period of Kyiv’s predominance. These differences were accentuated by the Mongol-Tatar invasions that began in the 1220s and culminated in the devastating sack of Kyiv in 1240. The territory that largely coincides with modern Belarus, with Polotsk as the most important centre, was one such emerging region. The land of Novgorod to its north was another. In the northeast, Vladimir-Suzdal (and later Moscow) formed the core from which developed the future Russian state (see also Grand Principality of Moscow). On Ukrainian territory, in the southwestern part of Rus, Galicia-Volhynia emerged as the leading principality. Volodymyr (modern Volodymyr-Volynskyy) in Volhynia had been an important princely seat in Kyivan Rus, and Galicia, with its seat at Halych, on the Dniester River, became a principality in the 12th century. In 1199 the two principalities were united by Prince Roman Mstyslavych to form a powerful and rich state that at times included the domains of Kyiv. Galicia-Volhynia reached its highest eminence under Roman’s son Danylo (Daniel Romanovich). New cities were founded, most importantly Lviv; trade—especially with Poland and Hungary, as well as Byzantium—brought considerable prosperity; and culture flourished, with marked new influences from the West. In 1253 Danylo (in a bid for aid from the West) even accepted the royal crown from Pope Innocent IV and recognized him as head of the church, although nothing substantial came from this. Danylo’s reign also witnessed the rise of boyar-magnate unrest, debilitating dynastic involvements with Poland and Hungary, and the Mongol invasion of 1240–41. These marked the onset of Galicia-Volhynia’s decline, which continued until the extinction of Roman’s dynasty in 1340. Lithuanian and Polish rule By the middle of the 14th century, Ukrainian territories were under the rule of three external powers—the Golden Horde, the grand duchy of Lithuania, and the kingdom of Poland. The steppe and Crimea, whose coastal towns and maritime trade were now in the hands of the Venetians and Genoese, formed part of the direct domains of the Tatar Golden Horde. This was the westernmost successor of Genghis Khan’s Mongol empire, whose khan resided at Sarai on the Volga River. By the mid-15th century the Golden Horde was in a process of disintegration. One of its successor states was the Crimean khanate, which after 1475 accepted the suzerainty of the sultans of the Ottoman Empire. Both the Crimean Peninsula and large areas of the adjoining steppe continued under the khanate’s rule until its annexation to the Russian Empire in 1783. Elsewhere in Ukraine, Mongol rule was largely indirect, limited to exactions of taxes and tribute whose collection was delegated to the local princes. It was also relatively short-lived; northwestern and central Ukraine became an arena of expansion for a new power that had arisen in the 13th century, the grand duchy of Lithuania. Having already over the course of a century incorporated all the lands of Belarus, Lithuania under Grand Duke Algirdas advanced rapidly into Ukraine. In the 1350s Chernihiv and adjacent areas—and in the 1360s the regions of Kyiv and, to its south, Pereyaslav and Podolia (Podillya)—were occupied by Lithuania. Competition with Poland over the former Galician-Volhynian principality ended in the 1380s in partition, by which Lithuania gained Volhynia and Poland was confirmed in its possession of Galicia. Thus, Lithuanian control extended over virtually all the Ukrainian lands as far as the open steppe and even, briefly, to the Black Sea. Within the grand duchy the Ruthenian (Ukrainian and Belarusian) lands initially retained considerable autonomy. The pagan Lithuanians themselves were increasingly converting to Orthodoxy and assimilating into Ruthenian culture. The grand duchy’s administrative practices and legal system drew heavily on Slavic customs, and an official Ruthenian state language (also known as Rusyn) developed over time from the language used in Rus. Direct Polish rule in Ukraine in the 1340s and for two centuries thereafter was limited to Galicia. There, changes in such areas as administration, law, and land tenure proceeded more rapidly than in Ukrainian territories under Lithuania. However, Lithuania itself was soon drawn into the orbit of Poland following the dynastic linkage of the two states in 1385/86 and the baptism of the Lithuanians into the Latin (Roman Catholic) church. The spread of Catholicism among the Lithuanians and the attendant diffusion of the Polish language, culture, and notions of political and social order among the Lithuanian nobility eroded the position of the Orthodox Ruthenians, as had happened earlier in Galicia. In 1569, by the Union of Lublin, the dynastic link between Poland and Lithuania was transformed into a constitutional union of the two states as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. At the same time, the greater part of the Ukrainian territories was detached from Lithuania and annexed directly to Poland. This act hastened the differentiation of Ukrainians and Belarusians (the latter of whom remained within the grand duchy) and, by eliminating the political frontier between them, promoted the closer integration of Galicia and the eastern Ukrainian lands. For the next century, virtually all ethnically Ukrainian lands experienced in common the direct impact of Polish political and cultural predominance. Social changes Over three centuries of Lithuanian and Polish rule, Ukraine by the middle of the 17th century had undergone substantial social evolution. The princely and boyar families tracing their roots to Kyivan Rus had largely merged and become part of the privileged noble estate of Lithuania and Poland. Long attached to the Orthodox religion and the Ruthenian language and customs, the Ruthenian nobility in the late 16th century became increasingly prone to Polonization, a process often initiated by education in Jesuit schools and conversion to Roman Catholicism. With the growth of towns and urban trades, especially in western Ukraine, the burghers became an important social stratum. They were divided both in terms of an internal social hierarchy associated with the guild system and by religion and ethnicity. Since the 13th century many Poles, Armenians, Germans, and Jews had settled in the cities and towns, where the Ukrainians were often reduced to a minority. Although the burghers came to play an influential role within the Ukrainian community, legal disabilities imposed on non-Catholics progressively limited their participation in the municipal self-government enjoyed by many cities and towns under Magdeburg Law. In the period of Polish rule the conditions of the peasantry steadily deteriorated. The free peasantry that had still existed into the late Lithuanian period underwent rapid enserfment, while serf obligations themselves became more onerous (see serfdom). Peasant unrest increased toward the end of the 16th century, especially in eastern Ukraine. The sparsely settled lands were opened to Polish proprietorship for the first time, and large latifundia (agricultural estates worked by a large number of peasants) were established through royal grants to meet the demands for grain on the European markets. To attract labour to the new estates, peasants were granted temporary exemptions from serf obligations; the expiration of these exemptions and the reintroduction of servitude among a population grown accustomed to freedom led to much discontent and peasant flight into the “wild fields”—the steppe lands to the east and south. Tensions were exacerbated by the fact that, while the peasants were Ukrainian and Orthodox, the landlords were largely Polish (or Polonized) and Roman Catholic, and the estate stewards or leaseholders for absentee proprietors frequently were Jewish. Thus, social discontent tended to coalesce with national and religious grievances. Religious developments As social conditions among the Ukrainian population in Lithuania and Poland progressively deteriorated, so did the situation of the Ruthenian church. The Roman Catholic Church, steadily expanding eastward into Ukraine, enjoyed the support of the state and legal superiority over the Orthodox. External pressures and restrictions were accompanied by a serious internal decline in the Ruthenian church. From the mid-16th century, both Catholicism, newly reinvigorated by the Counter-Reformation and the arrival of Jesuits in Poland, and Protestantism (albeit temporarily) made inroads, especially among the Ruthenian nobility. Attempts to revive the fortunes of the Ruthenian church gathered strength in the last decades of the 16th century. About 1580 Prince Konstantyn Ostrozky founded at Ostroh in Volhynia a cultural centre that included an academy and a printing press and attracted leading scholars of the day; among its major achievements was the publication of the first complete text of the Bible in Slavonic. Lay brotherhoods, established by burghers in Lviv and other cities, maintained churches, supported schools and printing presses, and promoted charitable activities. The brotherhoods were frequently in conflict with the Orthodox hierarchy, however, on questions of authority over their institutions and clerical reforms. Religious developments took a radical turn in 1596 when, at a synod in Brest, the Kyivan metropolitan and the majority of bishops signed an act of union with Rome. By this act the Ruthenian church recognized papal primacy but retained the Eastern rite and the Slavonic liturgical language, as well as its administrative autonomy and traditional discipline, including a married clergy. This so-called Uniate church was unsuccessful in gaining the legal equality with the Latin church foreseen by the agreement. Nor was it able to stem the process of Polonization and Latinization of the nobility. At the same time, the Union of Brest-Litovsk caused a deep split in the Ruthenian church and society. This was reflected in a sizable polemical literature, struggles over the control of bishoprics and church properties that intensified after the restoration of an Orthodox hierarchy in 1620, and numerous acts of violence. Efforts to heal the breach in the 1620s and ’30s were ultimately fruitless. (See also Eastern Rite church.)",CREDIBLE

The real aim is to undercut Ukraine aid WASHINGTON (AP) — For Vladimir Putin, victory in Ukraine may run through Texas’ Rio Grande Valley. In recent weeks, Russian state media and online accounts tied to the Kremlin have spread and amplified misleading and incendiary content about U.S. immigration and border security. The campaign seems crafted to stoke outrage and polarization before the 2024 election for the White House, and experts who study Russian disinformation say Americans can expect more to come as Putin looks to weaken support for Ukraine and cut off a vital supply of aid. In social media posts, online videos and stories on websites, these accounts misstate the impact of immigration, highlight stories about crimes committed by immigrants, and warn of dire consequences if the U.S. doesn’t crack down at its border with Mexico. Many are misleading, filled with cherry-picked data or debunked rumors. The pivot toward the United States comes after two years in which Russia’s vast disinformation apparatus was busy pushing propaganda and disinformation about its invasion of Ukraine. Experts who study how authoritarian states use the internet to spread disinformation say eroding support for Ukraine remains Russia’s top priority — and that the Kremlin is just finding new ways to do it. “Things have shifted, even in the last few days,” said Kyle Walter, head of research at Logically, a tech company that tracks disinformation campaigns. While experts and government officials have long warned of Russia’s intentions, Walter said the content spotted so far this year “is the first indication that I’ve seen that Russia is actually going to focus on U.S. elections.” This month Logically identified dozens of pro-Russian accounts posting about immigration in the U.S., with a particular interest in promoting recent anti-immigration rallies in Texas. A recent Logically assessment concluded that after two years spent largely dedicated to the war in Ukraine, Russia’s disinformation apparatus has “started 2024 with a focus on the U.S.” Many posts highlight crimes allegedly committed by recent immigrants or suggest migrants are a burden on local communities. Some claims were posted by accounts with tiny audiences; others were made by state media sites with millions of followers. This week the accounts seized on the recent death of a Georgia nursing student and the arrest of a Venezuelan man who had entered the U.S. illegally and was allowed to stay to pursue his immigration case. The killing that quickly became a rallying cry for former President Donald Trump and other Republicans who suggest that migrants commit crimes more often than do U.S. citizens. The evidence does not support those claims. The content, crafted in English, has quickly found its way to websites and platforms popular with American voters. Footage of a recent anti-immigration protest broadcast by Russian outlet RT, for example, was racking up thousands of views this week on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, and prompting angry replies from other users. The Russian outlet Sputnik ran a story this week about growing calls to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall, a priority for Trump, who failed to complete the job as president. An analysis of other sites that later linked to the Sputnik piece shows than half were in the U.S., according to data from the online analytics firm Semrush.com. Overall, Americans make up the English-language Sputnik’s largest audience. U.S. officials have warned that Russia could seek to meddle in the elections of dozens of countries in 2024, when more than 50 nations accounting for half of the world’s population are scheduled to hold national votes. While Russia has a strategic interest in the outcome of many of them — the European Parliament, for one — few offer the opportunity and the prize that America does. For Russia’s bid to conquer Ukraine, this year’s U.S. election stakes couldn’t be higher. President Joe Biden has pledged to fully back Ukraine. Republicans have been far less supportive. Trump has openly praised Putin and the former president has suggested he would encourage Russia to attack America’s NATO allies if they don’t pay their fair share for the military alliance. More than half of Republicans believe the U.S. is spending too much on Ukraine, according to a recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research that found Democrats to be much more supportive of additional aid. Soon after the war started, Russia mounted a disinformation campaign designed to cut into support for Ukraine. Claims included wild stories about secret U.S. germ warfare labs or Nazi conspiracies or that Ukrainian refugees were committing crimes and taking jobs from people who had welcomed them. That effort continues, but Russia also has shifted its attention to issues with no obvious tie to Moscow that are more likely to create cracks in the unity of its adversaries — for example immigration, or inflation, high-profile topics in the U.S. and Europe. “They’re very savvy and understand the right buttons to push,” said Bret Schafer, senior fellow and head of the information manipulation team at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a Washington-based nonprofit. “If your ultimate objective is to reduce support for Ukraine, your inroad might be talking about how bad things are on the southern border. Their path to win this thing is to get the U.S. and the E.U. to stop sending weapons and aid to Ukraine.” A message left with the Russian Embassy in Washington wasn’t immediately returned. America’s election may also be a tempting target for other authoritarian nations such as China and Iran that, like Russia, have shown a willingness to use online propaganda and disinformation to further their objectives. The online landscape has dramatically shifted since Russia sought to meddle in America’s 2016 presidential race won by Trump. Platforms such as Facebook and Instagram have banned many Russian state accounts and built new safeguards aimed at preventing anyone from exploiting their sites. In one recent example, Meta, the owner of Facebook, announced last fall that it had identified and stopped a network of thousands of fake accounts created in China in an apparent effort to fool American voters. Other platforms, including X, have taken a different approach, rolling back or even eliminating content moderation and rules designed to stop disinformation. Then there is TikTok, whose ties to China and popularity with young people have set off alarms in several state capitals and Washington. Artificial intelligence is another concern. The technology now makes it easier than ever to create audio or video that is lifelike enough to fool voters. Social media is no longer the only battleground either. Increasingly, Russia and other disinformation spreaders use encrypted messaging sites or websites that masquerade as legitimate news outlets. “A lot of their activity has moved off the major platforms to places were they can operate more freely,” said John Hultquist, chief analyst at Mandiant Intelligence, a cybersecurity firm monitoring Russian disinformation. Walter, Logically’s research director, said he is most concerned about disinformaton on X and TikTok this year, given their lack of controls and their popularity, especially with young voters. TikTok’s ties to China have raised national security concerns. He said that while election years tend to highlight the dangers of disinformation, the most effective information operations are launched years in advance. America’s adversaries have spent a long time studying its politics, building online networks and cultivating domestic divisions. Now comes the payoff. “They don’t need to put a ton of effort into causing disinformation,” Walter said. “They’ve already laid the groundwork leading up to 2024.”",CREDIBLE

The press event, inside a city theatre, was launching a new Taiwanese series, Zero Day, which depicts a Chinese invasion. Timing the launch with the air raid drill was a clever piece of theatrics, but it also emphasised the real-world implications of what both events were demonstrating – the worsening threat of China’s ruling Communist party making good on its promise to annex Taiwan. The 17-minute Zero Day trailer released that day sparked debate and anxiety across Taiwan. Despite the threat of invasion looming for decades, there are few if any modern Taiwanese cultural examples that depict this aspect of its existence. “The feeling that war is imminent is something that most people in peaceful countries find hard to relate to. In Taiwan, everyone thinks about it, but hardly ever talks about it,” the director, Lo Ging-zim, tells the Guardian in his Taipei studio. “But if we don’t make that fear tangible, if we don’t turn it into drama, we’re going to have a hard time getting people to start a dialogue quickly.” The plot begins with a Chinese warplane disappearing in the Taiwan Strait, and China using the search as a pretext for enacting a military blockade. Over the course of seven days it chips away further. The financial system crashes, communications are cut, foreigners and dual nationals flee. Fake news and fifth column sabotage spreads, and Beijing hacks public screens with a smiling, pink-jacketed Chinese news anchor urging Taiwanese to accept the “peaceful reunification of the motherland”. It is tense and eerily quiet – a realistic look at how a gradual choking of Taiwan before an assault could play out. Zero Day has a purpose – to light a fire under the Taiwanese about the need to, as the trailer says, “guard our homes, protect our country”. The trailer, viewed more than a million times now, quickly sparked an emotional reaction from Taiwanese. “We are finally beginning to face problems that many Taiwanese people dare not face head-on,” said one commenter on the trailer’s YouTube page. “It’s heavy because it’s possible,” said another. “Encourage Taiwanese people to have the courage to face war! Too many people are unwilling to face it. Thank you for firing a loud shot.” On TV talkshows pundits discussed the already real threat of disinformation, espionage and infiltration from China and its government’s sympathisers, how sabotage efforts may filter through the island’s networks of temples, or its media. Taking a risk to boost the ‘war effort’ References to Zero Day have already been censored on Chinese social media, and state commentary has accused Taiwan’s government of “spreading fear”. Lo hopes that people will see Zero Day because it’s good, but also because it will help reverse some of the desensitisation in society after years of Chinese pressure. “When it is shown visually, when it is happening in the streets and temples that people are familiar with, people have more real feelings and are willing to get up and do more … This way, there will be less chance of war.” The series features 10 award-winning directors and a cast including Japanese actor Issei Takahashi, Hong Kong-Taiwanese actor Chapman To, Kaiser Chuang and Ko I-chen, and Lien Yu-han. All took something of a risk to sign on. Many global companies and entertainers fear losing the Chinese market, and across the industry contracts ban entertainers from speaking on political subjects or being critical of Beijing. Some are pressured to support its “one China principle”, which claims sovereignty over Taiwan. “If they want to continue their careers, they must sign a contract which restricts them,” says Lo. One prominent actor was so desperate to join the cast of Zero Day, he asked if production could be delayed until their contract – which contained such restrictions – ran out, Lo says. The creators consulted with experts here and overseas about the most likely scenarios and tactics of a Chinese attack, and were assisted by the military in Taiwan to film on board ships and in restricted areas (Lo says the military had no say on the script). Zero Day centres on the months-long period between a presidential election and inauguration. It has received government funding through creative support channels, and from individual backers including Robert Tsao, a 77-year-old Taiwanese tech billionaire who has pivoted to boosting Taiwan’s non-government defences. In 2022, Tsao pledged a billion Taiwan dollars of his own money to train civilian militias and sharpshooters. The latter half of that plan has fallen by the wayside, he tells the Guardian, hampered by Taiwan’s strict gun laws. The training is primarily in first aid, disaster response, open-source intelligence analysis, and self-defence, run by the civil defence group Kuma Academy. Zero Day is his latest foray into the war effort. Tsao says such a film should have been made much earlier. For him, it’s part of the cognitive warfare battle with China. “We have to fight back,” he says. Taiwan’s government, particularly the previous Tsai administration, strove to balance the fostering of enough alarm that people supported government defence efforts, with not scaring them so much they gave up or fled. Tsao concedes there is a risk that Zero Day’s bleak and violent scenes could backfire, and help encourage people to leave instead of staying to defend Taiwan, as is anecdotally already happening. “Taiwanese know that if we are taken by the CCP [Chinese Communist party], no one will have a future.”",CREDIBLE

From the beginning of the 20th century there were three principal revolutionary parties in Russia. The Socialist Revolutionary Party, whose main base of support was the peasantry, was heavily influenced by anarchism and resorted to political terror. In the first decade of the century, members of this party assassinated thousands of government officials, hoping in this way to bring down the government. The Social Democrats (Russian Social Democratic Worker’s Party) believed such terror to be futile; they followed the classic doctrines of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, according to which the development of capitalism inevitably created a radicalized proletariat that would in time stage a revolution and introduce socialism. The party split in 1903 into two factions, which soon developed into separate parties. The Mensheviks, loyal to traditional Social Democratic teachings, concentrated on developing ties with labour and rejected as premature political revolution in agrarian, largely precapitalist Russia. The Bolsheviks, who in some respects were closer to the Socialist Revolutionaries, believed that Russia was ready for socialism. Their leader, Vladimir Ilich Lenin, was a fanatical revolutionary, who managed to organize a relatively small but totally devoted and highly disciplined party bent on seizing power. Convinced that workers by themselves could not progress beyond peaceful trade- unionism, he wanted the party to direct the working class on the revolutionary path. During World War I Lenin, living in neutral Switzerland, agitated for Russia’s defeat. This attracted the attention of the Germans, who came to realize that they could not win the war unless they somehow succeeded in forcing Russia to sign a separate peace. In April 1917 they arranged for Lenin’s transit through Germany to Sweden and thence to Russia, where they hoped the Bolsheviks would fan antiwar sentiment. To this end they generously supplied Lenin with the money necessary to organize his party and build up a press. Sensing the weakness of the provisional government and the inherent instability of “dual power,” on arrival in Russia (April 3, 1917 [April 16, New Style]) Lenin wanted to launch a revolution immediately. He had to contend, however, with the majority of his followers who doubted it would succeed. The skeptics were vindicated in July 1917 when a putsch led by the Bolsheviks badly misfired. They were near success when the government released information on Lenin’s dealings with the Germans, which caused angry troops to disperse the rebels and end the uprising. Abandoning his followers, Lenin sought refuge in Finland. After the abortive Bolshevik July rising the chairmanship of the provisional government passed to Kerensky. A Socialist Revolutionary lawyer and Duma deputy, Kerensky was the best-known radical in the country owing to his defense of political prisoners and fiery antigovernment rhetoric. A superb speaker, he lacked the political judgment to realize his political ambitions. Aware that such power as he had rested on the support of the All-Russian Soviet, Kerensky decided that the only threat Russian democracy faced came from the right. By this he meant conservative civilian and military elements, whose most visible symbol was General Lavr Kornilov, a patriotic officer whom he had appointed commander in chief but soon came to see as a rival. To win the support of the Soviet, still dominated by Socialists Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, Kerensky did not prosecute the Bolsheviks for the July putsch and allowed them to emerge unscathed from the debacle. By general consent the decisive event in the history of the provisional government was Kerensky’s conflict with Kornilov, which broke into the open in August (September, New Style). Although many aspects of the “Kornilov affair” remain obscure to this day, it appears that Kerensky deliberately provoked the confrontation in order to be rid of a suspected competitor and emerge as the saviour of the Revolution. The prime minister confidentially informed Kornilov that the Bolsheviks were planning another coup in Petrograd in early September (which was not, in fact, true) and requested him to send troops to suppress it. When Kornilov did as ordered, Kerensky charged him with wanting to topple the government. Accused of high treason, Kornilov mutinied. The mutiny was easily crushed. It was a Pyrrhic victory for Kerensky. His action alienated the officer corps, whose support he needed in the looming conflict with the Bolsheviks. It also vindicated the Bolshevik claim that the provisional government was ineffective and that the soviets should assume full and undivided authority. In late September and October the Bolsheviks began to win majorities in the soviets: Leon Trotsky, a recent convert to Bolshevism, became chairman of the Petrograd Soviet, the country’s most important, and immediately turned it into a vehicle for the seizure of power. The Bolshevik coup The events of February 1917 merit the name of Revolution because they were essentially spontaneous. October 1917 (November, New Style), by contrast, was a classic coup d’état carried out by a small group of conspirators. The Bolshevik Central Committee made the decision to seize power at a clandestine meeting held on the night of October 10 (October 23, New Style). There were considerable disagreements over the timing: Lenin wanted the coup to be carried out immediately; Trotsky and most of the others preferred to convene a national Congress of Soviets, packed with Bolsheviks, and have it proclaim the overthrow of the provisional government. A compromise was struck: the coup would take place as soon as practicable, and the Congress of Soviets would ratify it. This decided, Lenin returned to his hideaway, leaving the direction of the coup in the hands of Trotsky. Disregarding the authority of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet, dominated as before by the Mensheviks and Socialists Revolutionaries, the Bolsheviks invited those local soviets in which they enjoyed majorities to attend a national congress beginning on October 25 (November 7, New Style). In the meantime they built up an armed force to carry out a coup. The task was facilitated by the decision of the Soviet to form a Military Revolutionary Committee to organize Petrograd’s defense from an expected German attack. Since the Bolsheviks were the only organization with an independent armed force, they took over the Military Revolutionary Committee and used it to topple the government. During the night of October 24–25, Bolshevik Red Guards peacefully occupied strategic points in Petrograd. On the morning of October 25, Lenin, reemerging from his hideaway, issued a declaration in the name of the Military Revolutionary Committee, which had no authority to do so, that the provisional government was overthrown and all power was assumed by the soviets. The declaration referred neither to the Bolsheviks nor to socialism, for which reason the inhabitants of the city had no inkling how profound a change had occurred. Kerensky tried to rally the armed forces to save his government but found no response among officers furious at his treatment of Kornilov. On October 26 the rump Congress of Soviets confirmed the transfer of power and passed several decrees submitted to it by Lenin, including one that socialized nonpeasant private land. It also formed a new provisional government, chaired by Lenin, that was to administer until the Constituent Assembly convened. In Moscow the Bolshevik coup met with armed resistance from cadets and students, but they were eventually overcome. In the other cities of Russia soldiers, lured by Bolshevik slogans of immediate peace, crushed the opposition. The march to power was facilitated by the ambivalence of the Mensheviks and Socialists Revolutionaries who, though opposed to the October coup, feared a right-wing counterrevolution more than Bolshevism and discouraged physical resistance to it. The Bolshevik dictatorship Although Lenin and Trotsky had carried out the October coup in the name of soviets, they intended from the beginning to concentrate all power in the hands of the ruling organs of the Bolshevik Party. The resulting novel arrangement—the prototype of all totalitarian regimes—vested actual sovereignty in the hands of a private organization, called “the Party,” which, however, exercised it indirectly, through state institutions. Bolsheviks held leading posts in the state: no decisions could be taken and no laws passed without their consent. The legislative organs, centred in the soviets, merely rubber-stamped Bolshevik orders. The state apparatus was headed by a cabinet called the Council of Peoples’ Commissars (Sovnarkom), chaired by Lenin, all of whose members were drawn from the elite of the Party. The Bolsheviks were solemnly committed to convening and respecting the will of the Constituent Assembly, which was to be elected in November 1917 on a universal franchise. Realizing that they had no chance of winning a majority, they procrastinated under various pretexts but eventually allowed the elections to proceed. The results gave a majority (40.4 percent) of the 41.7 million votes cast to the Socialists Revolutionaries. The Bolsheviks received 24 percent of the ballots. They allowed the assembly to meet for one day (January 5 [January 18, New Style], 1918) and then shut it down. The dispersal of the first democratically elected national legislature in Russian history marked the onset of the Bolshevik dictatorship. In the months that followed, one party after another was outlawed, non-Bolshevik newspapers and journals closed, and all overt opposition suppressed by a new secret police, the Cheka, which was given unlimited authority to arrest and shoot at its discretion suspected “counterrevolutionaries.” The Peasant Union, representing four-fifths of the country’s population, which had opposed the October coup, was subverted from within and replaced by an organization created and run by Bolsheviks. In March 1918 the Bolshevik Party was renamed the Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik) in order to distinguish it from Social Democratic parties in Russia and Europe and to separate the followers of Lenin from those affiliated with the nonrevolutionary Socialist International. The party was directed by a Central Committee. To streamline work, from March 1919 onward its management was entrusted to the Secretariat, the Organizational Bureau (Orgburo), and the Political Bureau (Politburo). The Secretariat and Orgburo dealt largely with personnel matters, while the Politburo combined legislative and executive powers. Brest-Litovsk of Soviet Union One of Lenin’s highest priorities on coming to power was ending the war with the Central Powers. He feared that Russian soldiers, eager to return home to share in the distribution of looted land, would topple his regime if it continued the war. He also believed that an armistice on the Eastern Front would spark mutinies and strikes in the west, making it possible for the Bolsheviks to take power there. Immediately on taking over, the Bolsheviks proposed to the belligerent countries an end to the fighting. The Germans and Austrians promptly agreed to the proposal. In negotiations held at Brest-Litovsk, an armistice was arranged (December 1917). This was to be followed by a peace treaty. The Germans, however, posed extremely harsh conditions, causing a split in the Bolshevik high command: Lenin favoured accepting whatever terms the Germans offered, but the majority of his associates, arguing that this would mean a betrayal of the German working class, refused to make formal peace with the imperial government. In the end Lenin prevailed by threatening to resign. The terms of the Brest-Litovsk treaty, signed on March 3, 1918, were very onerous: Russia lost territories inhabited by more than one-quarter of its citizens and providing more than one-third of its grain harvest. It also exempted citizens and corporations of the Central Powers from Soviet nationalization decrees. But the treaty saved the Bolshevik regime: for the next eight months it received critical diplomatic and financial support from Germany that enabled it to beat back political opponents. Until the conclusion of the Brest-Litovsk treaty the Allies made friendly overtures to the Bolsheviks, hoping with promises of military and economic assistance to prevent its ratification. A separate peace threatened them with military disaster because it freed the Germans to transfer hundreds of thousands of troops from the Eastern Front to the west, enabling them to achieve the breakthrough that had so far eluded them. Once Russia had dropped out of the war, the Allies tried desperately to reactivate the Eastern Front, using for this purpose the Czechoslovak Legion composed of ex-prisoners of war, Japanese troops, and small contingents of their own forces landed in the northern port cities of Murmansk and Arkhangelsk (Archangel). But these efforts proved unsuccessful, driving the beleaguered Bolsheviks ever closer into the arms of Germany. In a supplementary treaty signed on August 27, 1918, Russia not only granted Germany additional economic right on its territory but obtained pledges that German troops would intervene to expel Allied forces from its territory and crush the so-called White armies formed in southern Russia. These arrangements came to nought because of the German surrender in November 1918. By the terms of the Treaty of Versailles Germany had to renounce what it had gained at Brest-Litovsk. “War Communism” A few months after coming to power the new Russian regime initiated a series of unprecedented measures intended to destroy all vestiges of private property and inaugurate a centralized communist economy. These measures, which in 1921 received the name “War Communism,” had two primary objectives. One was political: as Marxists, the Bolsheviks believed that private ownership of the means of production provided the basis of political power. By nationalizing it, they undermined the opposition. They further acted in the conviction that a centralized and planned economy was inherently more efficient than a capitalist one and would in no time turn Soviet Russia into the most productive country in the world. “War Communism” entailed four sets of measures: (1) the nationalization of all the means of production and transportation, (2) the abolition of money and its replacement by barter tokens as well as free goods and services, (3) the imposition on the national economy of a single plan, and (4) the introduction of compulsory labour. In the first year of the new regime all but the smallest industrial enterprises were nationalized. Agricultural land, the main source of national wealth, was for the time being left at the disposal of peasant communes, with the understanding that sooner or later it would be collectivized. Private ownership of urban real estate was abolished, as was inheritance. The state (that is, in effect, the Bolshevik Party) became the sole owner of the country’s productive and income-yielding assets. Management of this wealth was entrusted to a gigantic bureaucratic organization, the Supreme Council of the National Economy, which was to allocate human and material resources in the most rational manner. Money was effectively destroyed by the unrestrained printing of banknotes, which led, as intended, to an extraordinary inflation: by January 1923 prices in Soviet Russia, compared to 1913, had increased 100 million times. Ordinary citizens, along with the rich, lost their life savings. Barter and the issuance by government agencies of free goods replaced normal commercial operations. Private trade, whether wholesale or retail, was forbidden. All adult citizens were required to work wherever ordered. The independence of trade unions was abolished and the right to strike against the nationalized enterprises outlawed. One of the most severe problems confronting the new regime was providing bread and other foodstuffs to the cities and the newly formed Red Army, because the peasants were unwilling to sell their produce for rapidly depreciating money (“coloured paper”) for which there was nothing to buy. Lenin resolved the problem by exceedingly brutal and ultimately counterproductive methods. He ordered peasants to surrender all “surplus” grain to state organs at prices that bore no relationship to its actual worth. To overcome peasant resistance, armed requisition detachments assisted by regular army units were sent to the villages to extract food. Peasants who resisted these expropriations were labeled “kulaks” (kulak is the Russian word for “fist”). In time the policy of forcible extractions led to a regular civil war that cost the lives of untold thousands on both sides. A secondary objective of this campaign was to establish political bases of the new regime in the countryside, which had remained almost entirely outside its control. In the summer of 1918 the fortunes of the Bolsheviks were at their lowest ebb. They not only had to contend with rebellious peasants and hostile White armies supported by the Allies but they lost such support as they had once had among the workers: in elections to the soviets held in the spring of 1918 they were everywhere defeated by rival socialist parties. They dealt with the problem by expelling the Socialists Revolutionaries and Mensheviks from the soviets and forcing reelections until they obtained the desired majorities. Their growing unpopularity moved them to resort to unbridled terror. The Cheka had carried out not a few summary executions in the first half of 1918. In July, on Lenin’s orders, the ex-tsar and his entire family were murdered in the basement of a house in Yekaterinburg (called Sverdlovsk between 1924 and 1991) where they had been held prisoner. The formal “Red Terror” began in September 1918. The pretext was a nearly successful attempt on the life of Lenin by a Socialist Revolutionary, Fannie Kaplan. As soon as he recovered from what could have been fatal wounds, Lenin ordered the Cheka to carry out mass executions of suspected opponents. Thousands of political prisoners held without charges were shot. To prevent further attempts on his life and those of his associates, Lenin instituted the practice of taking hostages from among officials of the old regime and well-to-do citizenry: these were to be executed whenever the state’s interests required it. In the resulting carnage, an estimated 140,000 persons perished. The Civil War and the creation of the U.S.S.R. In the context of the Russian Revolution, the term “civil war” had two distinct meanings. It described the repressive measures applied by the Bolsheviks against those who refused to recognize their power seizure and defied their decrees, such as peasants who refused to surrender grain. It also defined the military conflict between the Red Army and various “White” armies formed on the periphery of Soviet Russia for the purpose of overthrowing the communists. Both wars went on concurrently. The struggle against domestic opponents was to prove even more costly in human lives and more threatening to the new regime than the efforts of the Whites. The Civil War in the military sense was fought on several fronts. The first White force, known as the Volunteer Army, formed in the winter of 1917–18 in the southern areas inhabited by the Cossacks. Organized by Generals Mikhail Alekseyev and Kornilov, after their death it was taken over by General Anton Denikin. Another army was created in western Siberia; in November 1918 Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak assumed command of this army and became the dictator of the territories where it was deployed. Several smaller White armies came into being in the northwest, the north, and the Far East. All were in varying measures supported by Great Britain with money and war matériel. The Allied intervention was initially inspired by the desire to reactivate the Eastern Front, but after the Armistice it lost its clear purpose, and it was continued on the insistence of Winston Churchill, who saw in Bolshevism a permanent threat to democracy and world peace. Neither the American nor the French contingents on Russian soil engaged in combat, and they were withdrawn after the Armistice. The British stayed on until the autumn of 1919, doing occasional fighting but mainly providing aid to the White armies. The Bolsheviks were slow to form a professional army, in large measure because they feared that the officer corps that they would have to engage to command the largely peasant army could provide a breeding ground for the counterrevolution. They also did not relish the prospect of arming peasants, whom they viewed as class enemies. At first they relied mainly on partisans and Latvian volunteers. In the autumn of 1918, however, having suffered defeats at the hands of the pro-Allied, anti-German Czechs, they decided to proceed with the formation of a regular army manned by conscripts. Command over the troops and the formulation of strategic decisions was entrusted to professional officers of the ex-tsarist army, some 75,000 of whom were drafted. To prevent defections and sabotage, the orders of these officers were subject to approval of Bolshevik political commissars assigned to them. Officer families were treated as hostages. At the height of the Civil War the Red Army numbered almost five million men. Overall command of this force was entrusted to Trotsky as Commissar of War and Chairman of the Revolutionary War Council, but all operational decisions were made by professional officers, most of them one-time members of the Imperial General Staff. The decisive battles of the Civil War took place in the summer and fall of 1919. Kolchak launched in the spring a drive on Moscow and approached the shores of the Volga when he was stopped by a numerically superior Red force and thrown back. His army disintegrated later in the year, and he himself was captured and shot without a trial, possibly on Lenin’s orders (February 1920). Of all the White generals, Denikin came closest to victory. In October 1919 his Volunteer Army, augmented by conscripts, reached Oryol (Orel), 150 miles (250 kilometres) south of Moscow. In their advance, Cossacks in White service carried out frightful pogroms in Ukraine in which an estimated 100,000 Jews lost their lives. Denikin’s lines were stretched thin, and he lacked reserves. He advanced recklessly because he had been told by Britain that unless he took the new capital before the onset of winter he would receive no more assistance. In battles waged in October and November the Red Army decisively crushed the Whites and sent them fleeing pell-mell to the ports of the Black Sea. A remnant under the command of General Pyotr Wrangel held on for a while in the Crimean peninsula, from where it was dislodged in November 1920. The survivors were evacuated, joining the one and a half million Russians in emigration. Estimates of the casualties of the Civil War, most of them civilian victims of epidemics and hunger, range from a minimum of 10 million to a figure three times as high. The communists’ victory cannot be attributed to the higher spirit of their troops. The rate of desertions in the Red Army was unusually high: Trotsky instituted a veritable reign of terror to prevent defections, including placing in the rear of the troops machine-gun detachments with instructions to shoot retreating units. Even so, desertions continued: at various times nearly one-half of the Red Army’s effectives (1.9 million men) were absent from the ranks. In part the Bolshevik triumph can be attributed to superior organization and better understanding of the political dimensions of the Civil War. But in the ultimate analysis it was due mainly to the insurmountable advantages that they enjoyed. The Reds controlled the heartland of what had been the Russian Empire, inhabited by some 70 million Russians, while their opponents operated on the periphery, where the population was sparser and ethnically mixed. In nearly all engagements the Red Army enjoyed great preponderance in numbers. It also enjoyed superiority in military hardware: since most of Russia’s defense industries and arsenals were located in the centre of the country, they inherited vast stores of weapons and ammunition from the tsarist army. The Whites, by contrast, were almost wholly dependent on foreign aid. One of the by-products of the Revolution was the separation of the borderland areas inhabited by non-Russians. When out of power the Bolsheviks had encouraged the process, advancing the slogan of “national self-determination.” Once in power, however, they moved decisively to reconquer these territories and reintegrate them into Russia. Except for those regions that enjoyed strong British or French backing—Finland, the Baltic area, and Poland—by 1921 the Red Army had occupied all the independent republics of the defunct Russian Empire. In 1922 Moscow proclaimed the creation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, composed of Russia, Belorussia (now Belarus), Ukraine, and the Transcaucasian Federation. (The first U.S.S.R. constitution was formally adopted in January 1924. In 1925 the All-Union Communist Party, later the Communist Party of the Soviet Union [CPSU], was formed.) Nominally a league of equals, the U.S.S.R. was from the beginning dominated by Russians. The federated state structure was a facade to conceal the dictatorship of the Russian Communist Party, the true locus of power.",CREDIBLE

Marc Santora and Brendan Hoffman Marc Santora reported from Odesa, and Brendan Hoffman from Kyiv, Ukraine. Ukraine’s largest children’s hospital was destroyed by a Russian missile on Monday, shaking Kyiv, the capital, with images of bloodied and injured children, and sending hundreds racing to the scene to help clear twisted metal and smashed concrete in a desperate search for survivors. The hospital strike was part of a barrage of bombings by Moscow across the country, including one of its deadliest assaults on Kyiv since the first months of the war. At least 38 people were killed across the country, including 27 in Kyiv. More than 100 people were injured. The Ukrainian air force said it shot down 30 out of the 38 missiles launched by Russia during the attack, which began in the midmorning. “The attack was massive, combined with the use of aerial, ballistic and cruise missiles,” said Serhii Popko, the head of the Kyiv military administration. “The missiles flew at the capital in waves and from different directions.” At the hospital, one doctor and another adult were killed and at least 10 more people were injured, including seven children, local officials said. At least three children were pulled from the rubble, Ukraine’s emergency services agency said. Advertisement Olha Melnyk, the mother of a child being treated in the oncology unit of the hospital — who was not there at the time — said she was in a state of shock. “There were so many families like us, who had their own personal war with oncology already,” she said. “And you know, these children can’t go to the basement, because all the tubes and treatments.

https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/georgian-snipers-admitted-that-they-shot-euromaidan-protesters-in-2014/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/journalist-claims-georgian-mercenary-snipers-killed-civilians-during-maidan/28888892.html,2025-01-07,"On November 27, the Russian state-owned news agency Sputnik News published an interview with Italian journalist Gian Micalessin, who said he had conducted exclusive interviews with three alleged Georgian “mercenaries” who claimed responsibility for shooting protesters in Kyiv during the 2014 Maidan protests. Micalessin’s version of events contradicts the widely accepted narrative which places the blame for the shooting on then Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych’s security services -- in particular, the special tactical unit known as Berkut. Micalessin’s report, called The Hidden Truth About Ukraine, aired on Italy’s Canale 5 earlier in November. Both the interview with Sputnik News and the video report are riddled with errors. “The journalist (Micalessin) was able to secure exclusive testimony from three Georgian ex-mercenaries, including Koba Nergadze, Kvarateskelia Zalogi, and Alexander Revazishvilli,” the Sputnik News story reads. “The three men revealed ties to former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili and the Georgian security services. Specifically, they explained that they were recruited in late 2013 by Saakashvili military adviser Mamuka Mamulashvili, given false passports and cash and sent off to strife-ridden Kiev.” Among other flaws, the video report shows identification cards to verify that the mercenaries worked for Georgian security services. However, the Russian news site The Insider noticed that the English-language text on their identification documents contains serious grammatical and spelling errors. Most notably, the title at the top of the card says “Security Service of Defend,” and the word “certificate” is incorrectly spelled “certifikate.” Additionally, BBC Monitoring reported Revasishvili pointed in the film to a picture on a smartphone screen. “That’s me,” he said, but the BBC established the story and photo were published years later, in December 2016. Despite the claim they were hired by Mamuka Mamulashvili, founder of the Ukrainian army volunteer unit known as the Georgian Legion, he arrived in Ukraine in April 2014, two months after the shootings of February 18-20. One of the two Georgians claims to have been trained by an American citizen, Brian Boyenger, formerly a U.S. Army sniper. While Boyenger did train Ukrainian military personnel and later served with the Georgian Legion in the war in Ukraine’s Donbas region, he arrived in Ukraine in 2015. Another claim debunked by The Insider is that Mamulashvili was ordered by ex-Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili to go to Ukraine and start a “revolution.” In fact, Saakashvili’s term as president ended on November 17, 2013, three days before the protests in Ukraine began. Euromaidan started as a small action consisting mainly of students, and did not grow into a major anti-Yanukovych movement until after November 30, 2013, when riot police brutally beat the young demonstrators, provoking larger protests. The Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found more than two-thirds of the protesters who came to Maidan in December 2013 did so because of the police brutality of November 30. In his interview with Sputnik News, Micalessin claimed to have confirmed the three men’s stories. “We talked for a long time,"" he told Sputnik News."" I wanted to make sure that they were really there. I did very long interviews with each of them and compared them, and it all came together. In another Eastern European country I met with the third man, Alexander [Revazishvilli]; his story matched up with the others.” But it is already clear that, contrary to Micalessin’s claim, the Georgians’ story doesn’t match up. They claim to have received orders from a president with no power at the time, before the mass protests that led to Yanukovich’s departure in February 2014. They claim to have been working under the command of a man who was not in Ukraine at the time and to have been trained by a man who wouldn’t arrive there for two more years. In the Sputnik News article, an embedded tweet by “Ian56” claims the snipers “were under the control” of a Ukrainian politician. The profile photo, however, appears to be that of a male model named David Gandy. Gandy also has his own Instagram account. Unlike the Twitter user “Ian56,” Gandy does not seem to take much of an interest in Ukraine. The tweet claims that the men in the photo are the snipers who were responsible for killing protesters. However, the photo is from a Russian media story that was debunked by Ukrainian journalists of StopFake.org in May 2014. The photo was taken in March 2014, about a month after the shooting. While Russian sources show random masked men coming out of a hotel (without properly identifying the location) and claim they are the snipers responsible for the massacre, there is actual video footage of police and Berkut personnel firing Kalashnikov rifles and various sniper rifles during the time of the massacre. In the video, the location can be positively identified as near the corner of Bankova and Institutska streets, known to be under control of the authorities at the time. More importantly, this location provides a clear line of sight to the area in which the protesters were shot. In another video taken from the protesters’ perspective around the same time, it is clear the people in the video are taking fire from a location ahead of their position, up the street on Institutska. The embedded tweet from “Ian56” is not the only already-debunked claim in the piece. Another is cited by Micalessin himself, when the interview continues after the tweet. “Doubts about who did the shooting emerged the day after [the shooting], when even the head of the Estonian Foreign Ministry, who supported Ukraine's opposition, said that he had serious doubts about the story,” Micalessin said. “Later, a Ukrainian doctor said that people from both sides [i.e., police and protesters] were killed by the same weapons. The Estonian minister presented his doubts to [EU foreign minister Catherine Ashton] via a telephone call. So this was something that's been discussed a lot.” In fact, this claim about Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet was debunked in March 2014. Paet himself refuted the claim that he suggested the protesters had been killed by members of the opposition movement as opposed to the authorities. “I call upon journalists to be careful with this recording, I only spoke about the versions of stories about what happened in Ukraine,” Paet told journalists at a press briefing held on March 5, 2014. “I did not give an evaluation. I just expressed concern that if these rumors begin to live their own lives, it can do harm to the situation in Ukraine.” Four years after the events which led to the deaths of dozens of protesters in Kyiv, little progress has been made in prosecuting those responsible, following allegations by the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group (KHPG) that Russia granted asylum to key suspects in the case. KHPG also alleges Ukrainian government and police officials blocked prosecution of key Maidan shooting suspects.",CREDIBLE

They cast further doubt on Nicolás Maduro’s declared victory. Anatoly Kurmanaev reported from Caracas, Venezuela. Ethan Singer analyzed the data in New York. Venezuela’s electoral body announced on Monday that the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro, comfortably won another six years in office, beating his main opponent by seven percentage points in a vote that was marred by widespread irregularities. But partial election results, provided to The New York Times by a group of researchers associated with Venezuela’s main opposition alliance, supply new evidence that calls the official result into question. Their figures suggest that an opposition candidate, a retired diplomat named Edmundo González, actually beat Mr. Maduro by more than 30 percentage points. The researchers’ estimate of the result — 66 percent to 31 percent — is similar to the result obtained by an independent exit poll conducted on Election Day across the country. It was not possible for The Times to independently verify the underlying tallies, which the researchers say were collected from paper receipts produced by about 1,000 voting machines, about three percent of the country’s total. By Wednesday, Venezuela’s government-controlled election authority had still not released detailed results, despite growing international pressure. Advertisement But several independent survey and election analysts reviewed the researchers’ approach and said that, based on the tallies shared by the researchers, the estimates appeared credible. And given the partial tallies, The Times was able to broadly replicate the researchers’ estimates of the result within two percentage points. The announcement of Mr. Maduro’s victory triggered deadly protests on Monday and led several Latin American countries to suspend or downgrade diplomatic relations with Venezuela, plunging the polarized country into a new period of flux.
