I'll analyze the text and provide my findings.

The text is a tweet with a link to a news article. The tweet itself is short and doesn't contain any explicit persuasive language. However, I'll analyze the tweet and the link to determine if any high-level persuasion approaches are used.

Tweet: ""SOURCES: https://t.co/5MjKoCd7Jn""

Analysis:

* Attack on reputation: No. There is no attack on the reputation of any individual, group, or organization in the tweet.
* Justification: No. There is no justification or explanation provided in the tweet to support a claim or argument.
* Simplification: No. The tweet doesn't oversimplify any issue or problem.
* Distraction: No. The tweet doesn't divert attention away from the main topic or introduce an irrelevant topic.
* Call: No. The tweet doesn't encourage the reader to take a specific action or think in a particular way.
* Manipulative wording: No. There is no use of loaded language, obfuscation, or repetition in the tweet.

However, I would like to note that the link provided in the tweet may contain persuasive language or arguments in the article itself. But based on the tweet alone, I couldn't find any evidence of high-level persuasion approaches.

Therefore, my answer is:
